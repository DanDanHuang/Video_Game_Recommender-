Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	" If you'd asked me a year ago, I might have told you that porting an old-style isometric RPG like Pillars of Eternity from PC to consoles without making it an unwieldy mess was effectively impossible. Obsidian Entertainment's incredible adventure draws so heavily from early BioWare RPGs like Baldur's Gate and Icewind Dale that it demands the similar use of a dizzying array of hotkeys, precise mouse clicks, and menus, and that design seemed hopelessly better suited to keyboards than gamepads. Pillars of Eternity: Complete Edition overcomes these obstacles, and that's why I find this adaptation so impressive. As the name implies, the Complete Edition includes all the content and patches released for the PC version to date, namely the base game from 2015 and the two halves of the underwhelming White March expansion. But Paradox Arctic, which was responsible for the console port, has achieved wonders with the transition to gamepads. Holding down the left trigger grants access to options like the quest log, leveling menu, and inventory, while squeezing the right trigger opens the menu for combat abilities. Pressing the square or X button lets you pause to issue orders, while the bumper buttons let you easily switch between characters. Most impressively of all, Pillars automatically highlights whatever you're looking toward so you can easily interact with it. Sometimes it bugs a little and requires precise handling, but these moments are mercifully rare. Its intuitive control scheme is nothing short of elegant, and it proves that this style of RPG no longer needs to be the stranger to console gamers it once was.   Technical issues as a whole are rare, save for small issues such as the map's refusal to open on the first click of the button. Yet there’s another issue that’s harder to forgive, and that’s why the Complete Edition might as well be subtitled ""Load Times of Eternity."" It's not so bad at first, but as the story expands and save files get thicker, the loading screens for even the simplest transitions can sometimes drag on for a minute or more. On a couple of occasions, I just shut the game down and restarted, finding that the same load screen worked much more quickly on the second attempt.  All text remains legible even when you're sitting a few feet away. The story itself has aged well, to the point that I'm now convinced more than ever that Pillars of Eternity's appeal rests on more than mere nostalgia for Baldur’s Gate. After two years, I was a little worried I'd find too many flaws in its sad tale of a wanderer who can see into the past lives of surrounding people, but I found myself warming to the old locales and personalities as readily as I might would with another spin with Minsc and Boo. It remains a text-heavy tale, though, enhanced only with good voice acting at the most significant moments, but fortunately Obsidian ensured all that text remains legible even when you're sitting a few feet away from the TV. It's an RPG that's as rich as any you'll find, and in some cases its sheer depth lets it surpass those with far larger development budgets. Pillars, unfortunately, lacks some of the playfulness that made Baldur's Gate so memorable, but it makes up for that with thoughtful lore crammed into everything from otherwise nondescript rocks and books rotting in cobwebby dungeons to sweeping descriptions of the past lives of random NPCs you pass. The Watcher, as the hero's known, forms alliances with recruitable party members ranging from mad, Rasputin-like wizards to a pious paladin with an oddly fitting Texas accent. There's a stronghold to repair and expand and numerous factions to build reputations with. Ask for anything you may want from an old BioWare Dungeons & Dragons RPG and you'll generally find it here, aside from the somewhat regrettable absence of a romance option. Make sure to check out my full review of the PC version and The White March Part I and Part II for more detail, as all of it remains true of the new console version.   On that note, it’s nice to see that the Complete Edition doesn’t shy from the PC version’s punishing difficulty. Reluctant to take the time to pause and issue orders to all six members of your party during a battle? Your merry band's likely going to die, even on Normal. At the same time, Paradox Arctic has made the excellent story accessible to people with no interest in combat via a Mass Effect 3-style Story mode that trivializes combat and lets you steamroll through most encounters as easily as a dragon might cook a steak. [Editor's note: this story has been updated to reflect that Paradox Arctic is responsible for developing the console versions of Pillars of Eternity.] The outstanding classic-style RPG Pillars of Eternity makes a surprisingly virtuosic transition to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 with the Complete Edition, bringing both systems all of the content that's been released on the PC version so far. For an RPG of its complexity, it’s surprising how pleasingly intuitive its gamepad control scheme is, and its easily legible text makes it feel just as good to play from the couch as from a desk. It's a memorable experience that suffers from only a few technical hiccups, most significantly its long and frequent loading times."
Jason Fanelli	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	 Its huge monsters put on a great and imposing show, but Gigantic is really all about making its action-MOBA gameplay accessible. Its characters challenge, but they’re not ultra demanding. Its multi-phase battles require strategy and teamwork, but you don’t have to be a master tactician to succeed. It takes time to learn, but we’re talking weeks instead of months. The drawback is that its short, rapid-fire matches risk retreading the same ground a bit too often. There’s currently only one way to play Gigantic: a 5v5 battle where teams must gather energy to power the massive monsters that sit on either side of the arena. These Guardians are far more interesting than ordinary MOBA objectives because they’re active participants rather than stationary punching bags, and the few times they battle each other during a match are always exciting. Watching one swoop in from its perch, wrestle its rival to the ground, and expose the weak point for its team to attack is really cool, and I wished they’d spend more time in action instead of holding back.  Every battle plays out in two phases, each one fun in its own regard. First is the main phase, a fun but familiar mode in which teams gather power and battle each other over objectives. It follows more of a Counter-Strike or Battlefield’s Conquest format, rewarding for kills as well as territories controlled, rather than a typical MOBA where control is king. The action can get repetitive, but that balance of objectives makes the main phase of Gigantic enjoyable despite its familiarity. The constant back-and-forth of claiming these territories kept me on my toes as I watched the power meters rise.  Rampage transforms the match into a more traditional MOBA style. The second phase, Rampage, transforms the match into a more traditional MOBA style of pushing toward the enemy’s side of the map, except that Gigantic’s original twist is to have one fully powered Guardian make its way across the map to attack and incapacitate its rival. The action becomes heated as every player makes a mad dash toward the two beasts, with one team focusing on the vulnerable Guardian while the other defends, unleashing all their abilities in a confined space. However, they only last a short period before reverting back to the main phase, and that brevity lessens the Rampages’ effectiveness. I also wish Rampages weren’t reserved for the same two spots on each map, as it’s odd seeing the struggles of powerful beasts like these happen in the same locations every time. After five Rampages without a victor comes the Clash, an endgame state which changes the battlefield to ensure matches don’t go on too long by opening new pathways and moving all objectives closer together. This creates more consistent action and quicker power-gathering. The Sanctum Falls arena during a Clash stands out for me, as it transforms from the largest map in Gigantic to the smallest in an instant. The action of Clash makes me wonder why it isn’t the default game mode, as it makes the main phase seem tame by comparison.  Gigantic throws an extra layer of strategy into the battle through tiny beings called Creatures with useful abilities that can be spawned from specific objective points. One might create a tree creature that heals nearby teammates, while another spawns a cyclops who builds walls to block paths; those extra powers give more importance to the decision of which points a team should concentrate on holding, depending on their strategy. These spawned helpers are also damage sponges, giving you plenty of time to come to their rescue. As the battle rages you can upgrade them to a more powerful form, making them even more important in battle and widening your options. If a healer isn’t available and I’m near death I know I can retreat to my creature and heal up.  Only the Sanctum Falls map features something interesting. The arenas you fight in are bright and filled with color but otherwise aren’t exciting. The Ghost Reef is a canyon dotted with abandoned technology, while Siren’s Stand is an icy tundra sporting a few shipwrecks – you’d think those unique features would create a distinctive feel to gameplay, but they don’t actually do anything except serve as background decor and have no memorable interactivity. Only Sanctum Falls features something interesting, with underwater areas that slow you down and inflict damage while you’re underwater, but even they are easily avoided and sometimes completely ignored. Likewise, the roster of 19 heroes (of which a rotating selection are available to play for free, in the League of Legends model) checks all of the traditional MOBA boxes in a fairly generic way. There’s a tank in The Margrave, melee specialists like the bull Lord Knossos, the fast but weak assassin in Tripp, and long-range spell casters like the mage Mozu. Some designs are cool, with the potion-happy Uncle Sven and the dragon sorcerer Charnok being personal favorites, but otherwise very few of these warriors stand out on the selection page.  The heroes do become more interesting in battle, though, thanks to a leveling system that’s more in-depth than most MOBAs. Each hero levels up and gains new abilities throughout a match, but Gigantic gives more choice here than most in that each ability has two tiers of perks, and each tier has two branching choices. The robot HK-206’s Bullet Barrage, for example, offers either a higher rate of fire or armor-piercing rounds at Tier 1. At Tier 2, choices depend on what you chose first: If you picked high rate of fire, you can upgrade it with either more close-range damage or the ability to slow enemies with each hit. That’s a level of customization not seen in similar games (those without gear shops, at least), and experimentation is rewarding and reveals new roles for each of the 19 characters. Uncle Sven starts out as a standard healer, but by enhancing his Fire Flask with increased direct-hit damage and the ability to cause Burning damage over time you can make him an effective mid-range attacker as well. Being able to choose perks on the fly also allows you to adapt to the flow of each individual match, giving you an awesome power over your characters.  Accessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless. The problem with this perk system is the actual process of selecting each one. Accessing the clunky upgrade menu renders your character defenseless, so you can’t safely choose a new perk unless you’re waiting to respawn or you’ve retreated from action to find a quiet spot and sacrificed your momentum. The menu itself is irritating because it doesn’t always respond to button presses, which can make getting to my intended perk (and thus the period of vulnerability) take even longer. I fell victim to more than a few ambushes because of that, which isn’t great even if the upgrade system is impressive.  All of that nuance sounds intimidating, but Gigantic does a great job of teaching the ins and outs. The mandatory tutorial clearly and effectively lays the rules out, more so than others in my experience. Once that’s out of the way, the Practice Arena lets you tinker with each character to your heart’s content, or you can play as many bot matches as you wish before jumping into the real deal. Where other MOBAs are sometimes more keen to throw new players to the wolves, Gigantic makes a real effort to provide ample opportunity to learn it, making me feel more engaged in the process. Gigantic is a free-to-play game, so naturally in-game currency is a thing and can be purchased. However, the Fortune Card challenge system makes earning money for unlocking new characters and skins more fun than the standard grind. Each card you get comes with a challenge to complete, ranging from easy ones like inflicting X amount of damage on a Guardian to tougher character-specific challenges and straightforward ones like hitting a certain level with your account. Having those achievement-like objectives tied to in-game cash rewards makes earning more feel like less of a chore. Balancing the objective-based main phase with the rushed and frantic giant monster-powered Rampage phase gives Gigantic a fast and distinctive pace that separates it from the MOBA crowd. Having to choose perks so frequently using the clumsy menu causes a lot of dumb deaths, but there are enough good ideas within each battle to keep it interesting – hopefully until more modes come along to prevent the one currently available from becoming stale. Gigantic is off to a good start, but it’ll need a little variety in the future if it wants me to stick around.
Dustin Toms	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	 Ask Tom Brady and Matt Ryan what they think about halftime adjustments. Those adjustments, major or minor, are the key to winning any football game – the types of championship-caliber adjustments we hoped for from Madden’s move to the Frostbite Engine in Madden NFL 18. The engine has enhanced the graphics dramatically and added an immense amount of detail to the absolutely wonderful Longshot story mode, but EA Sports misses the opportunity to really make its mark by refreshing the gameplay in meaningful ways. While playing a rematch of last season’s Patriots vs. Falcons Super Bowl, it was easy to get distracted by the lighting effects and the improved body types, which, to my eye, have both taken the largest leap of any of Madden 18’s graphical upgrades. While watching a replay I noticed details like how the glimmer of the sun flickered off of a receiver’s helmet, and even while referees are announcing penalties you can see that the glare in their faces is real.  The body types brought a second glance from the moment I turned on Madden NFL 18. Players still look a bit stiff and can run into each other while walking around between plays, but each position and body type is well represented, which is more than previous Maddens can say. And while it’s a smaller touch, stadium and uniform detail have really stuck out to me. The pop from the Seahawks’ lime green and the Buccaneers’ orange is a highly appreciated detail.  The new animations look great and aren’t repetitive. On the more tangible side, the engine switch makes gameplay look more fluid thanks to enhanced movement and interaction animations. My expectations weren’t too high considering FIFA’s first foray with Frostbite encountered speed bumps from using old animations in the new engine, but Madden doesn’t encounter the same problems. The new animations look great and aren’t repetitive, and so do the one-on-one interactions are strong and fluid in every activity I’ve seen (line play, secondary coverage, and tackling). When I picked off Russell Wilson in the red zone, my DB was tripped up by Doug Baldwin, and when I took a closer look at the replay the animation was spot on. (It’s a shame that to truly appreciate the animations you need to watch the replays, but I highly recommend taking the time to do it.) Gang tackling looks smoother as well, but we still see bowling pins and unnatural-looking rag dolls on occasion.   The new Target Passing mechanic, which allows you to lead your pass catcher, is a doozy to learn (or maybe I’m just terrible at it) because it moves extremely fast and demands on-point precision. I don’t always complete a pass, but I’m slowly getting the hang of it and how to lead correctly. I don’t think accuracy ratings play into the mechanic, which turns it into a mini-game inside the passing game. I don’t see the point of the mechanic because it doesn’t give me any reason as to why it’s better or a preferred way to be more accurate. Open practice is going to be your friend while learning how to use this, but I’ll stick with traditional button passing.  Target Passing doesn’t give me any reason as to why it’s better. Though it’s easy to see the graphical improvements, the real star of Madden NFL 18 is its new story mode. EA Sports finally breathes life into the single-player side with the introduction of Longshot mode: a fantastic story-based experience using a strong cast of motion-captured actors and a well-written script that kept me engaged with RPG-style decision making. Its storytelling sequences make great use of the more lifelike graphics – imagining what it would’ve looked like with last year’s engine made me appreciate Frostbite’s upgrades even more. A good single-player experience is a significant development for this series because it’s been without one for four years. Madden’s old solo mode, Superstar, was a waste of space and barely worth discussing. Thankfully, EA Sports eventually saw the light and dropped it after last publishing the mode in Madden NFL 13, which left Franchise as the only real single-player option. That’s why I’m so used to Madden being relegated to a fun, dynamic game of multiplayer football with my best friends, and of course the ever-growing online community. And that was great, but it wasn’t a good look for the NFL’s exclusive console game to lack a strong solo option while single-player modes are doing great things in other sports genres like NBA 2K and EA’s own FIFA series.   But in Madden NFL 18, EA Sports has created a theatrical-quality, immersive, emotional, and educational single-player experience that had me glued to my TV for its five-hour run. The Longshot story mode – an adventure that takes you through the life of former blue chip quarterback Devin Wade as he makes his way through high school, college, and the NFL – captured my attention as a student of the game and kept me coming back to find out what happened next.  The Longshot is a single-player experience that has me glued to my TV. While walking in Wade’s shoes, I encountered a sense of accountability I’d never felt in a sports game before. The script is very well written, and stays interactive with Mass Effect-like decisions and button prompts that will affect your football IQ, draft grade, and social standing. Even something as trivial as choosing to post a semi-crude video to social media can impact your story. I was torn down by my coach for calling the wrong play and brutally hammered by the media when a press conference quickly got out of hand, and for every big or small mistake I made, I felt bad for Wade because of the repercussions. Those choices felt meaningful on my first playthrough, but after playing 50 percent through for a second time to test their impact on the outcome it’s become clear that Longshot’s story is linear with a few alternate scenes and endings. It’s interesting that Longshot doesn’t rely much on Madden’s traditional football gameplay to succeed. Through the first two hours of the campaign, there was nothing more than a few button games and a quick challenge on the field. But once you hit the halfway point the gameplay kicks it up a notch and becomes a focal point as you begin to encounter former NFL stars throughout the mode.   After the ending, Madden seamlessly transitions you straight to Madden Ultimate Team (MUT) mode, instantly filing your collectible-card lineup with players, coaches, stadiums, and uniforms from Longshot. There are also 27 solo challenges in MUT that let you live relive key moments from Wade’s past, present, and future. The best challenges are reminiscent of the NCAA Football franchise, as you’re controlling the University of Texas vs. the Oregon Ducks with the NCAA theme song playing in the background. It’s a respectful nod to EA Sports’ historic and highly regarded but dormant college franchise. Plus, there’s an opportunity for EA Sports to release new challenges and cards that relate to Longshot throughout the year, potentially keeping the mode somewhat relevant for longer than launch period.   I have never been a fan of the grind that comes with the collectible card modes, but this year I was enticed to give Madden Ultimate Team a wholehearted chance with the Longshot elements and the new 3v3 competitive mode, MUT Squads, and was pleasantly surprised.  I could see Squads catching on with competitive esports teams You and two other players team up and fill the Offensive Captain, Defensive Captain, and Head Coach roles. The on-field team is a mix of the three users’ Ultimate Team lineups, opening up some really cool possibilities of creating a star-studded team at random. As a foundation, I love the idea, and I could see Squads catching on with competitive esports teams. In fact, I strongly recommend playing with a premade team you know, because some of the games I played with matchmaking were a much worse experience thanks to a lack of communication and a wide disparity in skill level. But winning as a team is much more fulfilling than winning a one-on-one match.   The other notable difference between MUT Squads and standard Madden gameplay is that the standard camera angle here is zoomed out pretty far, giving it a different feel. Controlling the smaller players takes a minute to get used to, but once I got the hang of it I appreciated the wide-open space and seeing my teammates run with me. I used the camera view to break a long touchdown run with Barry Sanders, something I wouldn’t have been able to do as strategically in the default camera angle. Another good tweak this year is the ability to play offline and in Franchise mode with three distinct gameplay styles: Arcade, Simulation, and Competitive. This addresses a long-standing frustration I’ve had with the series, in that I play Madden regularly with a handful of friends and acquaintances who all like to play in different ways. Some like to score as many points as possible and go for it on 4th-and-28. Others will delete my number from their phone if I ever go for it on fourth down early in the game while on my side of the field. It’s all about our own styles. So it’s a relief to see that those styles are now officially supported in Madden NFL 18. Arcade provides tons of scoring, limits penalties, and removes injuries entirely. Plus, the hit stick and fancy ball-carrier moves have an increased chance at succeeding, leading to more of the “Wow!” moments that I crave when playing for bragging rights. During my first game in Arcade mode, I launched an 80-yard bomb to the Titans’ Corey Davis for a quick score, only to be on the receiving end of a similar big play courtesy of Russell Wilson only three plays later. It’s a great mode for beginners and those looking to have a quick and entertaining game of Madden, especially considering the AI tends to be on the forgiving side of things. Simulation, which has always been my preferred style, gives the hardcore “Sim Nation” fanbase what it wants: an authentic NFL experience built upon stick skills and player ratings where penalties and injuries stay consistent. While using Simulation in Franchise, it encourages proper team building and play calling giving you the most realistic Sunday possible. Competitive is the final piece of the Madden puzzle, and one that will hopefully show the acceptance of Madden’s growing eSports community over time. Competitive really started to grow on me while I was in matchmaking (by the way – Madden has the most stable online servers of all the sports games). This mode is heavily weighted on stick skill, which made it that much more fulfilling when pulling out a win online. The improved ball hawk mechanics shine in this play style, as mastering the timing on errant throws can really add to your interception rate.  Another new mode, Play Now Live, allows you to follow along the real-life NFL season with in-game challenges to rewrite history, or imagine it before it happens. As an added bonus, the commentary is already updated with chatter of the NFL’s first week of preseason, which gives sophomore commentators Brandon Gaudin and Charles David fresh conversational material (which they sorely needed after a limp debut last year). This week, for instance, I played the preseason matchup between the Rams and Raiders, where the commentary of the big Sammy Watkins trade ruled the conversation. Once the game is completed, you can move right into Franchise mode to play out the rest of the season. Outside of the updated commentary, Play Now Live is lifeless, giving no reason to sit down and play awhile. Finally, it’s a bit disappointing that my favorite mode, Franchise, went almost completely untouched from last year’s version to this one. Tiny tweaks to the presentation were made, including lineup introductions showing full 3D model players rather than headshots. And the soundtrack is one of the better ones in recent years. But other than that, EA Sports’ developers really meant it when they said at E3 that the focus would be entirely on Longshot and the port to Frostbite, and it sucks that I haven’t been given a reason to fire up the new version. The shift to the Frostbite Engine definitely lets Madden NFL 18 look fantastic, and Longshot makes great use of that to tell a short but powerful against-all-odds story. MUT Squads also opens up a new way to play with more than two players. But beyond that, the underwhelming feel of gameplay improvements and lack of much of anything new within Franchise, Madden NFL 18 sails wide-right in the final seconds. That said, being a much better-looking version of a solid football game with a great new story mode makes it at least a significant improvement, even if it’s more incremental than we’d hoped from a new game engine.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/06/dirt-4-review	 If 2015’s Dirt Rally was Codemasters flipping over the couch cushions and finding the key to something special, Dirt 4 is the studio prying open the barn door and rediscovering the whole car. With a properly meaty career mode, literally endless racing thanks to its procedurally generated stages, and the best sound and visuals Codemasters has ever mustered, Dirt 4 has redefined what we should expect from modern rally games. The most amazing part of Dirt 4 is its new custom stage creator, which Codemasters has dubbed ‘Your Stage’. It’s an incredibly simple tool to use. There are just two sliders – one for length and one for complexity. That’s it. The process is instant and easy, and time-of-day and weather can be adjusted for any stage you create. Stages can be up to 12-or-so kilometres long and the off-track respawn limits have been pushed right out so when you crash, you can crash big.  The Your Stage tool supports five countries in Dirt 4 – Australia, the United States, Wales, Sweden, and Spain – which each offer very different terrain and demand different things from us behind the wheel. Australia is gravel-based, with a mix of wider areas with uncluttered verges and tighter zones that twist through the bush. It’s quick and it can be a bit forgiving, provided you have the space to make an error. Spain is quite different; it’s a tarmac-based affair lined with curbs, railings, and high stone and rock walls. It’s quick too, because there’s a lot more grip, but there’s a bit less margin for error here. I’ve clattered down more than a few Spanish hillsides blazing into bends at maximum attack.  There’s nothing about Your Stage courses that makes it obvious they’ve been built by an algorithm rather than a bunch of humans. You can’t raise or lower bits of your custom tracks yourself, nor can you push and pull certain sections around to customise the end product, but the impact of having a unique stage curated for every career event (and a bottomless supply of them at your fingertips outside of the career mode) cannot be understated. You can also save the ones you like most and share them with friends. Brilliant stuff. Most impressive of all, there’s nothing about Your Stage courses that makes it obvious they’ve been built by an algorithm rather than a bunch of humans. Segments are seamlessly blended together. Trackside detail is varied and the game’s pace notes – provided by Welshman Nicky Grist and Canadian Jen Horsey – are always accurate. Five environments is probably the bare minimum Codemasters needed (the traits Dirt Rally’s Finland, Monaco, and Germany would have brought to this game are missed) but we’ve definitely gained more than we’ve lost here. No more cheeky reverse stages or repetitive shared track sections, and no more belting up and down the exact same stages for months on end; Your Stage is a gamechanger for rally games. So take a Seat. Until now, Codemasters’ Ego engine games have always looked a little muted. Not Dirt 4. The lighting is the best that’s ever come out of Codemasters, from the way it plays off the different paint types and car surfaces to the way low sun lights up thick fog in a bright orange haze. The visuals still lack a little of the sharpness of some of its peers in the racing space (and some shadows get a bit choppy) but there’s a lot of great detail here. The heat haze wafting above the wide starting straights in the stadium-based Landrush events; the compacted dirt surfaces baking under the harsh sun. The leaf litter lining the unsealed backroads of Michigan, churned up and dancing in slipstreams. Dark new mud being caked upon dried, pale dust over the course of several heats of a Rallycross event. The absurdly good water splash effects. We couldn't leaf out this screenshot. I also love the way Dirt 4’s cars often look quite battle-weary, and not just after events when they’re carrying damage. The Dirtfish Rally School training cars are great examples; they don’t look like they’ve just rolled off the lot. They look like cars that have are punished and pummelled on a daily basis, with grubby glass and battered tyres, caked with dirt. Then there’s the sound, which is brilliant. Blasting over cattle grids sounds like the burp of a minigun, and the constant sweet, sweet exhaust overrun sounds like Satan half-choking on a pistachio. Sometimes I play in chase cam just so I can better hear the crackling pops of the exhaust, but it’s a real treat inside the cabin, too. A symphony of squeaks and clunks and buzzing bodywork at high revs, the sound design plays a vital role in making Dirt 4’s cars feel like real machines being pushed to their limits.  Weight shifting is improved, as is the feeling of aero grip at higher speeds. Dirt 4 has two physics modes – Simulation and Gamer – and leaderboards and online challenges segregate the two. Simulation is my preference because it makes the entire experience a real wrestle with a wheel. Weight shifting is improved, as is the feeling of aero grip at higher speeds. If you’re worried about Dirt 4 losing the brutal edge of Dirt Rally, don’t be. But don’t be worried about Dirt 4 being too hard for you either, because with the Gamer physics setting and various assists available it’s far more welcoming. I find the Gamer setting feels fine with the assists off but overall it takes away the need to put weight over the front for turn-in and can feel a bit too responsive to me. But having that option adds layers of accessibility to the experience without ever crippling the serious rally sim at its core. Career mode is a big step up from Dirt Rally, too, fleshing out the experience with team facilities and upgrades to spend your money on. The facilities and resources you have will determine how effective and useful your engineers and other staff will be for you. There’s a bit of micromanagement involved – particularly when it comes to staying on top of sponsor deals – but it’s a huge improvement from the admittedly soulless Dirt Rally. You’re also encouraged to build a personalised fleet of cars in order to enter as many championships and series as you can. I like how it’s easy to apply a consistent theme across all your cars but I think the livery editor could do with some more functionality; as it stands a lot of it is pre-set and ultimately results in cars that look a bit amateur lined up beside cars adorned with existing professional liveries. Something simple, like better control of the logo placement would probably be enough; more vinyl elements (like stripes and such) would be a nice bonus. The car mix is good, covering all major eras of rallying. Some categories are really well populated, though some are not. There is lots of great retro stuff, with the ’80s and ’90s quite well represented. The 2000s aren’t as well covered; the contemporary Group N/R4 cupboard is a little bare, and the 2000CC class is a bit of a weird one, bundling up a 2001 Subaru Impreza WRC and 2001 Ford Focus WRC and pitting them against the WRC manufacturers' world title winning Focus from 2007. Speaking of Focus... Also noteworthy is the Official World Rallycross Championship mode, which returns from Dirt Rally with most of the top World RX Supercars, the RX Lites, Group B rallycross, and a few more tracks (although not all the tracks in the real-world series are included, so it feels a bit truncated). It is such a great racing format for video games, though; short tracks, unique format, and astonishingly powerful cars going door-to-door. There’s also the Dirtfish Rally School, which is an awesome open area used for joyriding, testing, rally lessons, and some genuinely fun time attack events. And there’s the return of Dirt Rally’s regular community events, only this time it’s with stages that are always new to everyone who participates, plus curated and custom PvP competitive multiplayer modes for lobbies of up to eight (but no splitscreen). Multiplayer stood up well during testing with friendly players, though I fully expect the uncompromising and close-quarters nature of rallycross and Landrush (American, TORC-style short course off road racing) may be a frustrating cauldron for those trying to race clean(ish). It’s perhaps symbolic that Codemasters has included Colin McRae’s old co-driver in Dirt 4 for the first time in one of its rally games since Colin McRae Rally 2005, because Dirt 4 very much feels like a return to the good old days of the series. Hearing Grist’s pace notes again – a voice drilled into my brain in the late ’90s and early 2000s via my ravenous consumption of all games beginning with the word ‘Colin’ – has taken me back nearly 20 years. Back then Codemasters’ rally games were the yardstick against which all other racers with off-road aspirations were measured (at least up until the likes of Richard Burns Rally and WRC: Rally Evolved). Well, those days are back. Accessible yet tough and grimy yet gorgeous, Dirt 4 sets a new standard in rally racing – and its well-considered career mode and endless stages inject it with tremendous stamina. Absolutely stonking brilliant.
Joe Skrebels	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/perception-review	 Perception invokes the most basic human phobia - a fear of the dark - by placing you in the shoes of Cassie, a blind woman who navigates by means of echolocation. It gives her - and you - only momentary glimpses of her surroundings, forcing you piece together room layouts, landmarks, and threats in the mere seconds before the shadows rush back in. It’s emblematic of Perception’s problems, then, that my main emotion as I sat in the dark wasn’t fear, but irritation. The smart-sounding, high-concept set-up is ultimately its downfall, but along the way it bears some fruit. We’re so accustomed to being shown exactly where we are and where to go in games that to be left in darkness is actually refreshing at first. In the opening moments, exploring the purportedly abandoned New England house Cassie finds herself in is unnerving, opaque, and unpredictable. Until 10 minutes in, when you realise that the next four hours will amount to a bland adventure game with a veneer of horror and an increasingly awkward central gimmick. Cassie’s footsteps radiate a burst of ‘audio vision’ that gives you a glimpse of nearby surroundings with every move. For a more complete view of any given room you’ll need to tap her cane on nearby surfaces, sending a Daredevil-indebted swoosh of monochromatic blue across the screen and allowing you to pick out details. It’s rather pretty – particularly when swirling gusts of wind illuminate swathes of outdoor scenery (although once I got closer to objects, I couldn’t help but wonder if the darkness was used as an excuse to use less-taxing models and textures).   Developer Deep End Games’ solution to prevent you from simply spamming the echolocate button for a constant view of the house is to introduce The Presence, a stalking figure who’ll find and insta-murder you for making too much noise as you make your way around. The problem here quickly becomes clear. The lack of direct feedback for how much noise you can make before triggering an attack leads you down one of two paths: either spend a great deal of time in its relatively sparse hiding spots, or feel your way around the house in almost total darkness waiting for a cooldown on whatever invisible “trigger ghost” gauge sits behind it all. If that was Perception’s only major downfall it could still manage a scary tone, but the story is as much at fault for dampening an excellent central idea. Being hunted by something or someone through an unfamiliar space is a primally frightening idea. On top of that, the house frequently reconfigures itself in the dark, making getting familiar with a space only a temporary solution and creating a pleasingly old-school idea of the haunted house. All of which makes the multiple supernatural turns feel, at best, silly by comparison. As Cassie’s story quickly becomes part psychodrama, part time travel, her reaction to most of this is to make tension-killing quips. The fact that the developer includes an option to turn her incidental dialogue off before you begin playing is a warning worth heeding and, barring the mocking, unsettling vocals of The Presence, other characters’ voice acting is just as flat. It all rings false and, worse, juvenile. And I felt that way before I got to the section where you have to creep past haunted robot dolls on miniature train tracks with guns for hands.   The one area in which Perception does shine is in its depiction of the practicalities of blindness in the modern day. Research has clearly gone into how Cassie solves everyday problems: a text-to-speech app on her phone helps her read scattered letters, while she occasionally sends pictures to a volunteer phoneline operator who helps her interpret scenes she can’t see. Even human echolocation is a skill drawn from real life, and the brief moment we see of her learning how it works is genuinely interesting. All of this lends a sense of credence to a game that so often feels overly far-fetched. What’s left is the task of guiding Cassie around multiple versions of the same house, seeking out the recurring images of her nightmares. It’s a first-person point ‘n’ click in effect – walk to a room, find an obstacle, search for a way around said obstacle, repeat – but the limitations of Cassie’s blindness seem to have called for even that simple idea to be reduced to an annoyingly monotonous job. The biggest challenge, mostly, is simply finding the right door to use, and a “Sixth Sense” objective marker will generally point you in the right direction. There’s practically no puzzle solving, which would make it feel more akin to Gone Home and the like if it weren’t for how clumsily its story is implemented. The developers have made a lot of their past connection to BioShock, and Perception’s preoccupation with optional audio logs is a clear nod to that series’ storytelling style. Somehow, though, Deep End Games has forgotten BioShock’s decade-old lesson of audio logs: they should play in the background as you do other things. Perception is a game that, more than once, will only tell its story if you stare for 15 seconds at a plain coffee mug while you listen to someone else’s memories. Perception is as much a disappointment for the clever and inherently frightening idea it wastes as it is for the mistakes it makes. At its heart, there’s the promise of playing something genuinely new, from a perspective that could help teach and thrill simultaneously. It’s unfortunate that, like its echolocation mechanic, the more I saw of Perception, the more there was to worry about.
Darry Huskey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/16/injustice-2-review	 Like its cast of heroes, Injustice 2 is exceptional. The fight mechanics have been guided in the right direction following 2013’s Injustice: Gods Among Us. The hours of play potential in the new Multiverse mode alone is impressive. The heroes and villains of the DC Universe look better here than they have in any game before, even as they star in a grim and joyless “what-if” storyline. Just like its heroes, though, Injustice 2 overcomes that adversity and soars, with more single-player content than I’ve ever seen in a fighting game at launch and an unrivaled combo system that is a sheer joy once you master it.  Injustice 2 strikes a fine balance between retaining the strengths of Gods Among Us and making smart changes to improve mechanics. On top of new versions of memorable environmental attacks in which you slam enemies with everything from cars to giant stuffed alligators on the detailed stages, flashy transitions between different areas of the battle locations, and a full arsenal of over-the-top Super Moves including everything from mowing over your enemies with the Batmobile to traveling through time to slam your opponent off the hide of a dinosaur, it makes several big changes. Some of my favorites include the ability to spend meter in order to gain invulnerable movement to escape projectile-happy enemies, allowing you to block some environmental attacks, and a global increase in the speed sharpen the action. Faster walking speed makes matches feel quick and agile, a change from the at times plodding pace of Gods Among Us. New defensive options make fighting ranged specialists like Deadshot or Green Arrow less frustrating than the sometimes oppressive and seemingly endless barrages in we saw in the last game. Plus, the new additions to the cast ably fill a range of niches, such as Dr. Fate and Deadshot and their strong zone control, Black Canary and her quick and technical offense, or Atrocitus and Gorilla Grodd’s more methodical, heavy-hitting styles.  Injustice 2’s combo options are rivaled by few other games. One of the most impressive mechanical aspects is Injustice 2’s combo options, which are rivaled by few other games. For someone like me who enjoys spending time just beating up the training dummy and seeing what sort of insane juggles I can put together, it’s supremely enjoyable. You can bounce opponents off walls or the floor and launch them high into the air for juggle combos. Spending meter may alter the traits of a special move and open up new uses for combos: for example, Joker’s “BANG!” normally sees him pull out a revolver and fire a shot at his target. However, when used with Meter Burn, the revolver bullet launches his foe into the air, allowing Joker to juggle his victim. Each character has multiple ways to extend combos that are unique to them, and you can add onto that further by factoring in environmental attacks and positioning on the stage.  There is an incredible amount of content here for people that love fighting games but perhaps don’t enjoy competing against other people, or even for those that do like to mix it up with others but also enjoy chasing that next milestone or piece of loot. Hour for hour, Injustice 2 may have more content for solo players than any fighting game ever released. Most of it is excellent, except for the centerpiece: the story campaign.  I found little to love about the way the heroes are presented. I wasn’t a fan of the dark take on DC’s heroes in Injustice: Gods Among Us, which is a “what if” story about Superman going off the deep end after a tragic loss. So even though Injustice 2’s character animations in cutscenes and in-game are outstanding and border on photorealism for certain characters, I found little to love about the way they’re presented here. Even beloved symbols of light and hope advocate killing their enemies, arguing that the harrowing events around them are the result of having not permanently dispatched their villains in the past. Batman seems to be the lone voice of reason until you consider he is chastising Superman and Wonder Woman for their actions while allying himself with someone like Harley Quinn.  Injustice 2 does attempt to break up the dreary proceedings with the genuinely amusing Green Arrow and always likable Flash, the latter personifying the struggle between Batman and Superman and the things for which they stand. At the same time, it features a Joker that has to go down in history as one of the most tone deaf and misguided takes on the Clown Prince of Crime. Gone are the charm and black humor of the utterly mad wisecracking clown with the literally infectious laugh and flamboyant wardrobe, replaced by a Hot Topic psychopath growling generic threats and waving a knife around. Like the recent DC films, Injustice 2 confuses bleakness for gravity, and it stands in stark contrast to the whimsy, humor, and colorful settings increasingly favored by media rival Marvel Comics and in games like Marvel’s own upcoming fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite.  You’re expected to learn 28 characters on the fly. As you explore the conflict between Batman and Superman and the greater threat looming behind their war, you take control of nearly every playable character. This imparts a feeling of epic scale, giving you a glimpse into a global threat through the eyes of every central player in that saga, but in doing so Injustice creates a situation where you’re expected to learn 28 characters on the fly. The transitions from hero to hero can be frustrating, as you suddenly find yourself playing as a character you don’t know against a fairly proficient AI. There are no universal combos or combo mechanics in Injustice, so even a simple two or three-hit combo for Green Lantern may not exist at all for Batman. Every hero is unique, even down to basic attacks. Some have complicated inputs and cancels that aren’t immediately clear, like Robin or Bane. While this storytelling style helps to convey the massive scope of the DC Universe by allowing you to witness events under the ocean, on Krypton, or deep under Gotham taking place simultaneously, it affects the pacing of the story and makes it feel frustrating and uneven relative to something like Street Fighter or BlazBlue where you explore the universe around the characters via their individual stories.  Multiverse mode is fighting games’ answer to Destiny. Even though I didn’t care much for this particular DC story, I found a lot to love with the Multiverse. Multiverse mode is fighting games’ answer to Destiny, giving you the opportunity to level up your fighters, earn and equip gear for them, and use those power gains to take on increasing challenges that change every day. Common and rare gear pieces might simply augment one of four character statistics: strength, defense, health, or ability. However, rarer pieces and legendary gear sets can do everything from changing the color and size of projectiles to allowing your hero to start a match with a stock of meter. This imparts strategic depth to choosing just which pieces of gear to pair with your character and allows you to augment your abilities to something customized for your personal play style. Though Injustice 2 evens out the base statistics of all characters when playing competitively online, you can always choose to fight your friends drawing upon the full strength of your gear or to ignore those bonuses to level the playing field. Either way, the cosmetic changes remain. I was pleased to see that the rarer equipment changed my characters’ appearances, allowing you to tailor a unique look for your fighter. Changes can be as minor as the style of a breastplate, adding glowing eyes to Batman’s cowl, or giving Scarecrow a hood – or they can be something as major as changing the logo across Superman’s chest. Between the different shaders you can unlock and options for arms, leggings, chest plates and shirts, helmets and headpieces, and new weapons, there are a surprising amount of options for those of us that enjoy dressing for success. Injustice 2 also allows you to try your luck for rare equipment by earning loot crates by completing objectives, such as scoring well in Multiverse missions, completing the character-specific tutorials, or completing chapters in Story mode, giving you even more reason to check the Multiverse daily.  Fair warning: between Multiverse mode, five to 10 hours of Story mode (depending on your skill), and the deep offensive trees unique to each character, the sheer depth of content present might get intimidating for a newcomer once they begin to fully grasp what they’re getting themselves into. Though there are both general and character-specific tutorials, these walkthroughs only scratch the surface of the juggernaut beneath, especially in the case of the latter. Character training gives a brief overview and the bare basics for each face on the roster, but the gap between those introductory fundamentals and the 20-hit, 600-damage combos is wide, and Injustice 2 does little to guide beginners across it. Compared to Street Fighter V’s Mission modes, which teach you useful bread-and-butter combos of increasing difficulty, Injustice 2’s character tutorials impart only the bare minimum to get you started. Those that feel comfortable in executing complex inputs or training muscle memory can jump right in and have a blast, but if you’re new to fighting games you should know that pushing your success beyond the beginning stages will take some practice and time. In our testing on live servers the online multiplayer was as solid as a Kryptonian, with minimal frame delay and no freezing or lag stutters. Network connection strength between players is rated at one to four bars, and even at two bars, I was able to find playable matches. With more and more opponents taking the fight online, I noticed no initial stress to multiplayer servers and was still able to easily find ranked opponents to pummel. And, while online play can never reproduce the completely lag-free experience of facing a friend sitting next to you, Injustice 2 helpfully includes delay simulation in its training mode options. That allows you to replicate the slight amount of input delay you’d get playing a match online to help you hone your online combo execution to practice and adapt to that specific timing. Injustice 2’s fights improve on Gods Among Us in nearly every way, specifically addressing fan concerns about movement speed and giving you new ways to burn meter. Visually, the DC roll call shines even as they star in a flat and unnecessarily grim story. The unrivaled amount of single-player content to explore, especially the highlight Multiverse mode, and the height of Injustice 2’s skill ceiling make it an easy environment in which to lose hours of your day without ever even challenging another human… or giant telekinetic gorilla, as it were.
Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	 Billing itself as a “Hardcore Action RPG,” developer Deck 13 assimilates the difficult and labyrinthine style of games like Bloodborne and Dark Souls, and adds its own unique flavor to deliver a challenging and fun - though a bit disjointed - sci-fi survival adventure. You’ll spend the lengthy campaign in an exo-suit exploring a series of locations that check all the trademark boxes of a near-future industrial zone. Some of these environments clearly adhere to the Big Industrial Facility Rulebook, in that all maintenance shafts must look alike, but the majority of each area has its own unique style and a creative layout for its circuitous pathways. The vibrant color palette provides an interesting contrast to the horror of the events taking place within, and despite a few late-game jitters both the areas and action looks great on PC and really good on PS4 or Xbox One.   The main story is a fairly predictable excuse for clomping from spot to spot. There are some cool moments early on that lay the groundwork some potentially interesting character development, but those are quickly forgotten as it wades through several classic science-fiction tropes. I was able to follow along in broad strokes: “This thing is gonna happen and it’s BAD,” “Here’s a solution to the bad thing, let’s go get it” - but specific details are hazy, especially towards the end. It’s not that I wasn’t paying attention, but a lot of it was either glossed over completely or presented as background noise. A character may be giving a pointed speech about the hubris of mankind, but I’m too busy trying to avoid being clubbed to death by cyborgs to let it fully sink in. It also doesn't help that what truly interesting moments there are take upwards of 10 to 15 hours of exploration and grinding to reach – though the story does become significantly more intriguing (and convoluted) in the second half.  Details like this really help flesh out the world.  But, as excuses for lumbering around in an exo-suit go, it accomplishes what it sets out to by giving you a decent amount to do. In addition to a few side tasks for NPCs in each area, The Surge does a really good job of letting you discover information in the world around you. There are a bunch of detailed and well-acted audiologs and some great environmental storytelling as well. Anti-suicide warnings are posted on bridges in production areas while screens blast chipper PR nonsense about the “corporate family” nearby, or you’ll find a pair of bodies huddled close together in the back of a maintenance tunnel. Small design details like this really help flesh out the world, which makes it kind of strange that things get so confusing in the main story.   The Surge’s gameplay follows the now-familiar formula of letting you collect as much XP and scrap as you dare while battling various robots, zombified coworkers, and bosses before you cash it in and level up, but if you get killed you’ll lose whatever resources you had on you. Returning from Deck 13’s last game, Lords of the Fallen, are a multiplier mechanic that increases your earnings with each kill and resets if you deposit your scrap or die, and a post-resurrection countdown timer that eliminates your earnings if you take too long to retrieve them. They’re interesting inclusions that dramatically raise the stakes, heightening both the exhilaration of success and the maddening frustration of failing to recover large amounts of XP. Where The Surge really excels, however, is in its combat encounters. The fights might not be the most brutally challenging I’ve ever played, but cutting through a group of enemies is still satisfying. Enemies aren't particularly smart, which is fine for zombies and drones, but the lack of any self-preservation instinct feels especially out of place when tackling late-game human foes. Still, they all still require a deft hand to counter, dodge, and to generally avoid being murdered by. It’s a solid balance of strategic offense and defense and borderline-arcadey hack & slash action that, while campaign’s story lost the ability to motivate me five or 10 hours before I finished it, I found the combat itself enjoyable right up through the end.    Where The Surge really excels is in its combat encounters.  The most interesting part is the dismemberment system, which not only finishes off opponents in grisly cinematic fashion but also lets you harvest new gear for your exo-suit. Picking which body parts to attack in order to harvest new items adds a cool tactical dimension to fights: what parts do I need to build this item? Is it worth risking the huge pile of scrap I’m carrying to get them? The novelty of each animation may have worn off after a while, but seeing the cue for an execution pop up was consistently satisfying and, on occasion, provided a few much-needed seconds of respite during a stressful fight against multiple opponents. When you do manage to hack off enough arms or bisect enough torsos to build yourself some shiny new gear, expect to spend a fair amount of time agonizing over which of your recycled outfits to don. Each piece of armor grants buffs against various types of damage (as well as boosting other stats), and since you take these pieces directly from your enemies, you’re able to analyze their strengths and weaknesses accordingly. Can’t get past that armored guy with the big hammer? Well, it looks like the helmet I tore off his buddy is weak against elemental damage, so why not light him on fire or knock him into that toxic waste over there? It’s a simple system, but it does a good job of encouraging you to constantly experiment with the different items in your inventory, especially when coupled with the multitude of bonus-granting implants I could install as I leveled up.  The weapon designs are similarly interesting, from a set of dual-wielded forklift arms repurposed as makeshift blades to a massive two-handed hydraulic press-turned-warhammer, but I didn’t see much use in switching between them. I found one that worked for me and my character build early on and upgraded it often, so it was always the most powerful thing in my inventory. Aside from a few finds at the very end, everything else was obsolete before I even picked it up. It was a shame, because while I’d definitely experiment with different weapons in New Game + – which so far seems to be an increase in enemy damage output with a few new beasties peppered in – but in my first playthrough it felt like using anything else was giving myself an unnecessary handicap. The Surge makes good use of its detailed sci-fi setting and provides an engaging experience throughout the 30 to 40-hour campaign, mostly thanks to its widely customizable inventory and wickedly fun combat system. It may struggle to keep the action moving and tell a strong story amid the chaos of battle, and its weapon progression plateaued early, but it offers some interesting ideas and delivers a solid new take on a familiar genre.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	 [Note: When Prey launched, I hit a game-breaking bug on PC that prevented me from recommending it. That’s now been patched, and so has this review. It’s now updated to cover our experiences on all platforms. It was initially scored as a 4.0 on PC.] With a sophisticated setting built to accommodate classic RPG mechanics we don’t see often enough in modern games, Prey feels both new and nostalgic at once. A wonderfully explorable science-fiction environment proves dense with interactive systems, intrigue, and ever-present danger. And even though combat’s only slightly preferable to the weak stealth options, I was a little surprised at how quickly my time-played clock seemed to tick toward 40 hours before I reached the end. The first hours of Prey are enticing, with a mind-bending psychological opening scene that foreshadows a story more interesting than what the main plot ends up being. It’s fairly strong nevertheless, with some interesting implications and a few surprising characters who keep things moving along during dozens of hours of exploration. Its twist on the typical amnesiac protagonist premise prompted me to question everything I was told as I roamed the enormous and fascinatingly anachronistic space station, Talos I.   Arkane has done a fantastic job of making this bizarre place feel lived-in. The most interesting stories were the smaller ones I came across, those of the people who lived on Talos before, during, and after it was attacked by aliens. Between terminals containing all sorts of emails, well-acted audio logs, and thoughtful environmental storytelling, developer Arkane has done a fantastic job of making this bizarre place feel lived-in long before I ever met another living human. There’s so much storytelling treasure to uncover here, ranging from squabbles among co-workers to more personal notes like a scrapped proposal speech, Dungeons & Dragons character sheets, and even hilariously terrible in-universe science-fiction novel snippets. It’s an impressively fleshed-out universe, built around an alternate history of the space race that somehow led to an elaborate orbital station, complete with artificial gravity, where touchscreen computers exist side by side with film projectors and rotary telephones. I enjoyed uncovering how that history unfolded in bits and pieces gleaned from news articles and tidbits on the brief loading screens. That, combined with being rewarded for picking up literally any piece of useful gear or actual trash thanks to a cartoonish recycling system that lets you turn even old banana peels into raw materials for manufacturing weapons and upgrades, made me eager to turn over every metaphorical rock on Talos.  Which is devious, because some of those inanimate objects are actually disguised facehugger-style aliens who will surprise you by abruptly revealing themselves when you get close and trying to eat your face off. The presence of these mimics, as they’re known, gives all of that exploration a looming sense of paranoia: you have to question why objects are placed where they are, which works because just about everything on Talos is meticulously laid out in a way that, for the most part, makes sense. It sets all kinds of cruel traps for you, such as when one of what appears to be a pair of much-needed health packs actually turns out to be a predator lying in wait for wounded prey. The jump scares did get old after a while, but I never stopped feeling the tingling sense of tension upon entering a new room.  Prey follows closely in the footsteps of System Shock 2 and the original Deus Ex. Mechanically, Prey follows closely in the footsteps of classic first-person RPGs like System Shock 2 and the original Deus Ex, and puts some of their best ideas to good use. There’s complex character development along six different skill trees, plus modular upgrade systems for both your space suit and your scope. With all of those options and not enough upgrade items to go around, there are enough meaningful decisions to make your version of Dr. Morgan Yu (who, notably, can be either a man or a woman according to your whim) feel like your own, and tailored to your playstyle. Equipping the mimic-detecting scope upgrade, for instance, let me change up the task of sweeping a room before it became tedious. Prey can take a bit too long to get to the good stuff, though – the psychic power options didn’t open up for me until I was more than 10 hours in, and I never saw any suit mods until even later than that.  Most of the abilities themselves don’t feel like much of anything special, as things like enhanced strength, repair skill, the ability to move objects or kill with your mind, and even resurrect the dead to fight for you have all appeared in plenty of games lately. What makes Prey feel more distinct is the flexible, semi-open-world level design that allows you to reach objectives by different paths, depending on your strengths. (Granted, that’s also shown up in recent Deus Ex and Dishonored games, though not on this style of open map.) One character build might look for opportunities to hack into computer terminals to bypass locked doors, while another would use brute force to open doors or remove barricades, and still others might just search the environment until they find the passcode written carelessly on a post-it note somewhere. Even though I didn’t have all the abilities I needed to exploit them, it’s fun just to try to spot all the ways into a locked room and appreciate the thought that went into designing these puzzles. Plus, it’s a pleasant surprise that you’re able to move and climb so nimbly in general, and moreso when it’s upgraded, letting you reach some out-of-the-way places and further encouraging exploration.  I usually had unlocked new abilities that let me access new nooks and crannies. Your main quest – and the many side quests that can extend the life of Prey from a 15 to 20-hour run to something more on the order of 40 or 50 – will send you back and forth across the same moderately varied zones repeatedly. I didn’t get tired of seeing the arboretum, the cargo bay, the lobby, the crew quarters, or any of the others, though, because I usually had unlocked new abilities that let me access new nooks and crannies since the last time I’d been there. I did, however, get a little sick of trying to find my way around the outside of the station. It’s the closest thing to a fast-travel system Prey has, but it’s annoyingly tough to figure out where the right airlock is, especially since there’s no “up” in the zero-G environment. When I finally encountered some living, breathing humans and heard about their predicaments, at first I was disappointed at the lack of dialogue options to decide what the outcome of those quests would be. But then I realized that Prey’s approach is more novel: you’re given a task, such as saving someone or killing them, and your actions determine your moral position. Do you save a group of people under attack or leave them for dead? Do you take revenge on the man who killed a survivor’s partner or let him live? Do you kill mind-controlled humans or find a way to free them? It’s an interesting and more subtle yet more active approach than simply stating whether you’re good or bad. It’s nice to see actions speak louder than words when it comes to RPG morality, and those choices were satisfyingly – if somewhat bluntly – recognized in the ending. Without spoiling anything, I found the final reveal slightly deflating, but the setup for where the story could go next has great potential. All of the detail put into the environments and storytelling goes a long way to compensate for the fact that Prey isn’t exactly the best looking game out there. It only occasionally looks bad, such as when characters other than the handful of main allies move their mouths, but most of the time it makes the most of its sometimes flat-looking textures to make its zones appealing. Creature design, on the other hand, is one-note. All of the aliens are made of the same black goo, which, while creepy when moving through the shadows, doesn’t hold up in the long run. Some of the larger aliens are just weird-looking blobs, and the robot enemies are all built on the same floating PC tower-like chassis.  Combat turns out to be Prey’s biggest weakness. The act of fighting them, and turrets around the station once they decide you’re a threat, turns out to be Prey’s biggest weakness. Combat is fine, for the most part; the main weapons are a very typical pistol and a shotgun, with a couple of other similarly uninteresting high-tech options thrown in. Even when mental abilities such as creating copies of yourself or planting flame mines get involved these fights have nothing approaching the bloody, supernatural acrobatics of Arkane’s other current series, Dishonored. Most enemies are as bullet-spongy as their gooey look implies, especially before you max out your damage upgrades on both your character and your weapons, and ammo is scarce. That led to some tense standoffs where I was left trying to fend off aliens with my lowly wrench melee attack, but that lasted only until I unlocked the mind-control power that immediately renders even the biggest and fiercest enemies docile long enough for you to bludgeon them into puddles of goo. It became a chore long before the time the save-corruption issues declared my game over, and I’d mostly switched to Jedi mind-tricking my way past most fights. This isn’t the squishy human you’re looking for. You could, of course, stealth your way past most, if not all of the enemies out there by distracting them with thrown objects (or the goofy knock-off Nerf gun), but Prey isn’t interesting as a stealth game. There are no attempts to detect you other than randomly patrolling aliens, and no alarms raised if they do find you. Meanwhile, the only significant power that seems geared toward stealth is the ability you swipe from the mimics to transform into any small object, which effectively makes you invisible as long as you’re holding still (until your psych power meter runs out). That, as it turns out, is the least-useful application of that power. Prey is workable as a stealth game, but barebones enough that I generally opted to fight instead.    You’d think the ability to turn into literal pieces of trash would let you play hilarious pranks. More disappointingly for a systems-based game with such strong connections to Deus Ex and Dishonored, the enemy AI isn’t reactive or curious-seeming enough to make them fun to mess with using your powers. For instance, you’d think the ability to turn into any inanimate object, such as literal pieces of trash like banana peels or bio-waste bags, would let you play hilarious pranks on enemies and get funny reactions. But none of these creatures – including the rare humans you come across – react any differently to a strangely placed chair than they do to a valuable item. You’re either ignored completely or discovered and attacked without a word (because the aliens don’t talk), so it feels like I’m telling a joke that nobody’s around to hear. I did have fun messing with the innovative Gloo Cannon, which launches blobs of instantly hardening foam to very briefly immobilize enemies, clog holes, or create platforms. Its ability to create staircases had me thinking outside the usual box here and there, but it’s nowhere near as full of possibility as a Portal Gun or Gravity Gun when it comes to solving puzzles. You can’t, for example, build towers of goo on top of goo, so your ability to build Minecraft-like structures is limited. The biggest bugs I’ve encountered since the patch are small annoyances. Some of the most common items you pick up – alien organs and spare parts – often fail to stack properly in the screen inventory, which causes a needless hassle when your slots fill prematurely. Oh, and one time I was launched into space through a wall while passing through an anti-gravity field and had to reload an autosave (which is generally pretty good at saving frequently). But none of that ever did much more than slow me down for a few moments.   Controls feel good on mouse and keyboard, but with a gamepad the first thing you’ll want to do is turn the sensitivity up – otherwise, constantly turning to face mimics that jump behind you gets frustrating quickly. Load times trend a little on the long side on consoles, though, and we’ve inconsistently seen some minor input lag on the PS4 that took some time to get used to. And if you’re a PS4 Pro owner, unfortunately there aren’t currently any enhancements in resolution or frame rate. It’s 30 frames per second on console and uncapped on PC, where it runs beautifully aside from the first time I visited the reactor, but that was easily fixed by a restart. Prey’s curious alternate-history universe, intriguing sidequests, hidden threats, and detailed environmental storytelling make Talos I a joy to explore. The unsettling sense of paranoia that comes from knowing any object could turn out to be a hidden enemy gives even the quiet moments a palpable tension. All of that picks up the slack for combat and stealth that doesn’t feel fresh enough to sustain it throughout what can be a long game.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	 Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels is an expansion I could never have predicted. I had a bunch of theories around what Playground Games’ follow-up to the excellent Blizzard Mountain was going to be, and they were all wrong. What we got instead is a high-octane fever dream of life-sized toys and upside-down racing, and a surprisingly drastic departure from Forza Horizon’s established norms. Preposterous, incongruous, and completely and utterly outrageous. And I love it.  Forza Horizon 3’s first paid expansion, Blizzard Mountain, brought with it a driving experience like never before seen in the series. Specifically I’m talking about the added nuance the slippery surfaces inject into Forza’s driving dynamics and the way severely reduced visibility impacts the way we attack dangerous roads at speed. But this stuff seems almost quaint in comparison to the radical new driving challenges Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels has brought with it.  A wild world engineered inside the mind of an eight-year-old child. Loops and half-pipes. High speed, near-vertical bends. Boost pads. The biggest jumps in the series to date. Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels takes Forza’s very familiar physics and forces us to use them to survive a wild world engineered inside the mind of an eight-year-old child. It’s fun racing, cut from the same cloth as Trackmania Turbo and GTA Online’s stunt races, that nonetheless retains Forza’s driving feel. Executing a loop-the-loop in a Forza game will be a very foreign experience for series veterans, but the semi-realistic handling model remains unaltered. For those of you who like to hoon around with minimal driving aids, prepare for the stress of wrestling a rear-wheel drive monster back under control while you’re bouncing off the limiter after a boost pad sent you to top speed like a Scud missile with seats and a steering wheel. The world itself is larger than Blizzard Mountain and even more stunning. During the day the sunlight picks up the scuffs on the giant plastic tracks. They’re translucent, too; just watch how stretches of track arcing into the sky glow orange and blue as the sun beats down on them from behind. At night it’s equally impressive; the well-lit tracks create amazing snakes of light against a backdrop of millions of stars, glinting over the ocean. Objects in mirror are closer than they appear. I absolutely adore the attention to detail, too. Beneath the tracks, enormous connecting pieces hold each segment of track together – pieces of moulded plastic that, in reality, fit into the palm of your hand but here are the size of a tennis court. The boost pads are basically treadmills embedded into the tracks powered by enormous, animated engines that dwarf the game’s cars, spluttering and belching black smoke as you speed by. There are even massive, animatronic T. Rexes, chomping and roaring, which are dotted across one of the world’s six islands in homage to Hot Wheels’ occasionally prehistoric predilections. Navigation is a bit more difficult as most of the tracks are either suspended over the water and have walls on each side, so speedy, direct shortcuts are out (and off-road content is limited). You can fast travel to almost anywhere on the map though – even roads you haven’t driven on yet. The only exceptions are steep or heavily banked sections of track that can only be taken at speed.  The Hot Wheels expansion apes Blizzard Mountain’s progression system, which awards stars specific to levels of success in events. Simply complete a race and you’ll receive a single star. You can net two stars by actually winning it, and three stars by winning it and fulfilling one extra condition. I actually reached the Hot Wheels finale event largely on the back of completing all the available Bucket List challenges, drift zones, speed traps, and jumps (most of which seemed quite forgiving) and few actual races, but there is no shortage of the latter. As in the main game and Blizzard Mountain they can be completed as bespoke events or as part of longer championships. Getting to the final Goliath race won’t take returning players long, but completing every race will take a lot longer. The Blueprint system that allows us to customise our own races still exists in Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels, but it’s been reimagined as ‘Stunt Swap’ and allows us to trade out pieces of predetermined track for various stunt segments, like loops, dips, crossovers, and such. The effect of swapping these sections isn’t especially drastic, though; we’re not talking about Trackmania levels of custom tracks, here. It's actually really, really hard to see out of. The 11 cars added in Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels are crackers. The Hot Wheels Bone Shaker and custom 2005 Mustang are returning rides (they first arrived as DLC for Forza Motorsport 6), as is the 2010 Pagani Zonda R (although it hasn’t been seen since Forza Motorsport 4/Forza Horizon on Xbox 360). What’s left is a typically eclectic bunch of vehicles that you’d be hard-pressed to find in any other racing game, from the special Hilux former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson and James May drove to the North Pole, to the record-setting and relatively unknown Valiant Charger E49. There are also two more unique Hot Wheels models – the Twin Mill and the Rip Rod. If you’re a little precious about fantasy cars cluttering up your Forza experience, don’t be; like the Bone Shaker and 2005 Mustang, these are also Hot Wheels models that have made the jump from die cast cars to real-life (the real-life, fully-functioning Twin Mill debuted at the 2001 SEMA show and is powered by a pair of 502 Big Block for an estimated 1,400 total horsepower). There’s a barn find here, too, which I won’t spoil – but hot rodders should love the customisation options. Back in 2011, pro racer, stunt driver, and X-Games gold medallist Tanner Foust successfully launched his Team Hot Wheels trophy truck further than any other four-wheeled vehicle in history. He did it from a giant jump assembled at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, built to appear like a life-sized length of bright orange Hot Wheels track. Forza Horizon 3: Hot Wheels is Foust’s enormous toy ramp surrounded by a city-sized network of equally insane stunt tracks: a bedroom floor on an unlimited budget. What’s not to love? A delightful, daring, and different expansion that reinforces Forza Horizon 3’s reputation as one of the best racing games ever made.
Chase Becotte	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	 NBA Playgrounds takes a decent shot at revitalizing the once-great genre of arcade basketball games. It comes close to pulling it off, too, and even as it handed me some unfair-feeling defeats its retro style and simple gameplay reminded me why I still love this style of 2v2 basketball. What stands out from the start in NBA Playgrounds are the aesthetics. From Oscar Robertson’s sideburns to Magic Johnson’s short shorts, the developers at Saber Interactive appreciate the past and present style of the NBA. They also went out of their way to add signature animations to certain players, so Shaquille O’Neal has his thunderous two-handed jam and Allen Iverson has a unique crossover that’s immediately recognizable. There was love and attention paid to the hundreds of dunk and pass animations in Playgrounds, and these visual payoffs are what give it a standout quality. In a similar way, Playgrounds is pretty clearly trying to pay homage to old arcade classics like NBA Jam and NBA Street. What Playgrounds gets right about that is that it’s easy to pick up a controller and quickly feel at home. In no time I was drilling three-pointers and spinning into the lane for massive hammers. Its artistic style and tight controls are good at creating highlight reel-worthy moments, letting you meet someone at the summit to block a would-be ridiculous dunk or hit a late, long shot to seal the game.  Its pace of play is slower than something like NBA Jam, but it works for Playgrounds. It’s not so much about darting up and down the court to get power-ups, but rather about timing a crossover to coincide with when your opponent reaches for a steal or throwing a timely elbow to clear some space before going up for a three-point shot. This pace and timing is something I only started to truly get a feel for after multiple hours of play time, adding some level of depth.  Some things felt unfair or difficult to read. But in that same way, the more I got into Playgrounds, the more I noticed some things that felt unfair or difficult to read. For example, you build up a meter by doing things like throwing alley-oops and blocking shots to get a random power-up, like in Mario Kart. The problem is some power-ups are much better than others, and the system can come off feeling unbalanced when your opponent gets the equivalent of the blue shell and makes a shot worth 12 points. It feels bad to lose completely randomly like that. The timing-based shooting mechanic is another element that does not quite fit this style of game. The intent is to add an element of skill that separates experienced players from the inexperienced by rewarding a perfect release with an extra point, but the animations just aren’t consistent or readable enough. There’s no way to really know if shot timing is tied to each shot or alley-oop animation, or if it’s the same across all of them, so even after playing for many hours I am no closer to deciphering the perfect timing that the AI can execute reliably.  This lack of explanation also caused confusion when it came to the shoving mechanic. It’s never explained that shoving will deplete the meter you’re trying to build up, and so it took me a bit before I figured out why I was never filling my meter enough to get a power-up. Once I knew how these two things relate to each other, I never used shoves unless I already had an empty meter because the payoff wasn’t worth the downside. Instead, it just seemed more logical to mostly use the steal button, which is strong enough on its own.  Importantly, there are no microtransactions. These hiccups are frustrating because the core of Playgrounds is solid. It takes a page out of NBA 2K’s myTeam or EA Sports’ various Ultimate Team modes by having you start off by opening three packs of cards to unlock your initial players, and earning more packs immediately becomes the main draw here beyond the gameplay. Importantly, there are no microtransactions – you simply get new packs each time you level up by playing the various modes. I love opening a pack of cards to hopefully find one of my favorite players like Allen Iverson, or Steph Curry, or Alonzo Mourning. The roster has impressive depth, with each team having three to eight current and former players available. Saber Interactive has promised that more players will find their way into the mix post-launch. For example, Giannis Antetokounmpo is not currently available, but if I were a betting man I’d say he’s likely to appear later. Speaking of post-release content, one other update that will be a welcomed addition is four-player online play. Currently, it’s limited to two players online, with each controlling a team with an AI partner, and as of now the teammate AI is functional but not ideal. For example, sometimes when I tell my teammate to go up for an alley-oop he’s very delayed or never does it at all, which leads me to idly dribbling around or trying to score a different way before I lose the ball. Those little miscues can be the difference between a win and loss, and so the high-level competitive aspect of this game online will rely on four players being able to control all the action.  The players you use will also level up as you play more games with them, giving them new animations in the process. Unfortunately, Playgrounds does not make it clear what types of animations are being unlocked, so I didn’t really care much about getting my players from the “bronze” to “gold” level. This is a missed opportunity to me because there are a ton of awesome dunks and a healthy variety of dribbling animations, but without telling me what I’m getting, I don’t know what to look for game to game. Tournament mode, exhibition, and online play are the three modes available, and winning each of the six tournaments the first time rewards you with a new court, a “golden” pack of cards (which gives you a better chance of finding Epic and Legend players like Allen Iverson, Magic Johnson, and Shawn Kemp) and a new power-up. Tournament mode took me roughly four hours to complete, but it only took that long due to a couple of frustrating difficulty spikes. Going up against a dynamic duo like Shaquille O’Neal and Allen Iverson required some trial and error to find the right combo, which felt jarring because Playgrounds didn’t usually ramp up the difficulty match to match. Playgrounds is not a game I would want to keep playing for long if I were only going to play against the CPU, and so couch play and online is where I’ve spent more of my time. However, it’s not very well built out at the moment – at launch you’re limited to matchmaking only, so there is no way to play with friends online. (The Switch version has no online play at all right now, but Saber says it will be added in a post-release patch.) This, in conjunction with the lack of four-player online play, really hurts the online component for now. But I’ve still had more fun online than off. NBA Playgrounds isn’t as deep as NBA Street or as beautifully simple as NBA Jam, but the gameplay is still well paced and the controls are still tight. It mixes this gameplay with cartoonish qualities and a retro style that fits an arcade basketball game, and earning new packs of random players is always rewarding. That said, I’ve taken some bad beats from the random power-ups system, and the online options are slimmer than I’d like. But as long as Saber Interactive delivers on its post-release updates, Playgrounds will have enough going for it to keep me coming back for more.
Joe Skrebels	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review	 Hide and Seek is a horror game. You run from a pursuer, hurriedly choose a hiding spot, then just wait – with only breath and heartbeat in your ears – for a pair of legs to pass your slim field of view. They stop. You stop breathing. They pass. You start breathing. And then they’re back, you’re caught, the game is over. It’s a design that horror games have always favoured, but where most shock by using the moment of being found, Little Nightmares captures something more nuanced: that creeping fright of waiting to be caught. If you were going to be dull about it, you’d describe Little Nightmares as a 2D stealth puzzle platformer. Guiding a tiny, raincoated character called Six from left to right through the sea-swaying innards of The Maw (an ocean facility with a slowly revealed, despicable purpose) is a matter of avoiding instant-death hazards and gentle puzzling about how to proceed – but it rarely feels as plainly mechanical as that. At around five hours long, Little Nightmares feels slightly too brief –- the implied sense of scale suggests there was surely more Maw to see than the route Six takes –- but that’s perhaps testament to how much fun Tarsier has with throwing ideas at us and leaving them aside once they’re done.   Little Nightmares’ closest relatives are Playdead’s exemplary Limbo and Inside, not just because of its faint glee at the idea of a child in mortal peril, but in how cleverly it braids together puzzle design and storytelling. Every enemy, every room, every meat grinder you use to make a rope of sausages to swing from, contributes to the story of The Maw and Six’s seeming breakout. It’s quietly masterful (not least for a studio releasing its first original game) and never more so than in the giant, twisted figures of those trying to stop you proceeding. It must be said that, where Playdead’s blank stories encourage debate about metaphor and meaning, Little Nightmares’ wordless style is a little harder to swallow when the story seems more straightforward. Getting to know why Six is… the way she is (I’ll say no more on that) feels as though it would have added to the experience, rather than ruining any mystique. A nightmarish custodian who literally sniffs you out as his hideously long arms feel their way towards your hiding place; twin butchers, fattened and deformed by god knows what; the ghoulishly beautiful woman in kabuki dress that haunts Six’s dreams. Each owns a stretch of the rooms you need to pass through and, as you’re forced to watch their grim (if oddly mundane) business in hiding, each teach you a little more about just how bad a situation Six is in. All that’s left to do is creep past, outsmart them using the room around you or, most horrifying of all, realise there’s no fight, only flight, and be forced to simply run past in the hope they can’t catch you.  The Maw itself is something like the world’s worst doll’s house.  Developer Tarsier doesn’t shy away from showing them in their full, grim glory. You know where your predators are and what they can potentially do to you at almost all times – you’re more worried about them knowing where you are. I don’t recall a single jump scare in the entirety of Little Nightmares’ runtime, but I know I yelped as a butcher wheezed and stooped to check under the greasy workbench I was hiding beneath, or as something chased me through a room neck-deep with shoes (an admittedly uneasy callback to Holocaust imagery). Six is trespassing on their property – the sense that they know the lay of the land in a way you don’t is overwhelming. The Maw itself is something like the world’s worst doll’s house, the front walls wrenched away and its themed rooms built to absurd dimensions – made to reflect a small child’s view of a giant, adult world. It’s lit like a haunted house, regularly forcing you to flick open Six’s only possession, a tiny cigarette lighter – but it’s more terrifying for not being abandoned. This place – with its nurseries full of restlessly sleeping children, curious packages transported by hook, and some truly disgusting visitors – is grotesquely functional. It allures as much as it repulses, adding up to make for one of the best gaming locations I’ve seen in years, startlingly new and painstakingly tooled to encourage cautious exploration (including some very satisfyingly hidden secrets).   Its dioramas are beautifully drawn and wonderfully tactile, allowing you to build makeshift staircases out of gargantuan filing cabinet drawers or climb up craning, curling furniture to out-of-sight shelves. Smaller objects can be picked up and thrown, most often to no benefit other than being a nice way to take your mind off things as you enjoy some appropriately childish property damage. On a side note, I don’t think I’ve ever enjoyed the soft flumpf of jumping on a digital bed like I have in Little Nightmares. It’s a shame, then, that Little Nightmares’ primary problems are so boring. Its ‘2.5D’ set-up (Six can creep some way up the Z-axis in every environment) makes certain moments of precision platforming simply irritating, specifically when you jump slightly at the wrong angle and tumble unnecessarily into an abyss. Likewise, a few of its instant-death obstacles are the kind of trial-and-error puzzling that should have been left behind last decade. Couple that with inconsistent checkpointing and long load times (a trade-off presumably made to allow entire chapters of the game to be played seamlessly), and death can become more frustrating than frightening.  The camera moves like some floating, flitting eye, watching events unfold but unable to do a thing about it. Those are occasional issues, though, more than made up for in the constant pleasure of exploration, which is enhanced by some subtle tricks. Environments are often built just bigger than the camera’s field of view can handle, almost daring you to look into their dark corners (occasionally revealing the horrors to come a little earlier than you might expect). The camera itself moves with an ever-so-slight delay and sways with The Maw’s ocean rocking, giving the impression of not being a perfect lens but some floating, flitting eye watching events unfold but not being able to do a thing about it. There’s much more to enjoy, from the lovely way Six cradles her lighter while she runs to stop it going out, to “boss battle” sections that require you to outthink your potential captors across multiple rooms, constantly re-evaluating where they could emerge from – to the point where you simply cower in a dark place, just in case their will breaks before yours. It’s the quintessentially well-designed game; animation, sound, presentation, and puzzles each affecting the other in a constant, gorgeous cycle. Like Hide and Seek, Little Nightmares confidently captures the exhilarating fear of waiting to be found by something that’s hunting you. But it also replicates the alien horror of being a child that doesn’t understand what’s happening to and around them, and of a seemingly familiar environment turned into a series of opportunities for safety and danger. Smart, grotesque and never-endingly weird, this is a very different, extremely welcome kind of horror game that left me wanting more than its brief five hours provides.
Samuel Claiborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	 Originally released for the Nintendo Entertainment System, most of the games included in the Disney Afternoon Collection were popular at the time and are fondly remembered today. And some are still fun, especially with the new Rewind feature that takes the edge off the difficulty by letting you instantly reverse your errors. Even so, this is a collection aimed squarely at fans of old-fashioned platformers that makes little effort to update them for modern conventions. Although there’s a stigma around licensed games now, the Disney Afternoon Collection’s six games were designed by Capcom at its 2D height, right alongside greats like Mega Man 2 and Bionic Commando. And you can really feel the ‘90s Capcom magic: These games are universally beautiful, feature great music, and, despite the kiddy licenses, can be really challenging. The talented team that resurrected old ROMs for the Mega Man Legacy Collection have outdone themselves once again, with perfect emulation that looks great on new TVs. Both the aforementioned Rewind feature and an ability to save once (but only once per game!) can help you get through the tougher areas. This wizard-level tool even plays the music in reverse (no hidden messages discovered - yet).  Since there are six games, let’s take a quick look at each, in order from best to worst.   DuckTales is one of the best platformers ever made. Its cane-bouncing twist encourages exploration with tons of hidden secrets and large, multi-path levels. It’s kind of like a simplified Metroid, with ducks and pogo sticks. DuckTales famously includes some of the best music of the 8-bit era, with tunes that belong on your ultimate NES mixtape alongside Mega Man 3 and Castlevania. DuckTales is beloved enough to have received the remake treatment few years back -- but the original, as preserved here in its original pixels, is easier on my retro-loving eyes.   DuckTales 2 is a scarcely distributed NES game that most people probably missed in 1993 (Super Mario World had been out for two years!), and it’s a suitable sequel. With even more exploration required than the first to piece together hidden map pieces and unlock a secret ending, the only thing DuckTales 2 lacks is a killer soundtrack.   Rescue Rangers was a hit back in the day because, like Contra and Bubble Bobble, it featured co-op multiplayer, which was a novelty at the time. Unlike DuckTales, there’s nothing to explore or unlock here, but it’s still an absolute blast. With Player 1 given control over the Rewind feature, chaos ensues: While you can still pick up the other player and toss them in a pit for yucks, you can now reverse that decision and save a friendship -- or make him or her relive the moment forever.   Rescue Rangers 2 is another game that you probably haven’t played because it was released in 1994, the year the PlayStation came out in Japan. Most people weren’t playing 8-bit games by that point. It doesn’t hold up as well as DuckTales’ sequel: With two players you can breeze through it, since there are few puzzles and no real challenge aside from bosses.   Darkwing Duck is like a Mega Man game if you removed all the fun levels and interesting weapon variety. You are basically stuck with a weapon resembling Mega Man’s dinky mega blaster while you save your special weapon pickups for the surprisingly brutal boss fights. It’s slower-paced than DuckTales or Rescue Rangers, and even the Rewind feature can’t make shooting the same enemies over and over, one sad shot at a time, any fun.   Finally, there’s TaleSpin, the hardest game in the bunch. It’s sidescrolling shooter that allows you to turn around at any time, which is a cool twist. The Rewind feature helps you survive, but even with control over time itself the bullet-crammed boss fights can be enraging. In addition to these six games you get some extras, like a Boss Rush mode with leaderboards. Perhaps the coolest bonus feature for my fellow NES historians (hi!) are galleries of design documents, rare posters, and trivia. Strangely, the museum stuff reveals some of the Game Boy versions of these games, which are sadly not included in this collection. With three hits and three duds from Capcom/Disney years that you might remember with varying levels of fondness, the Disney Afternoon Collection is clearly aimed at children of the 90s. I have trouble seeing its appeal to anyone else. But if vintage duck-based platformers are your thing, grab a Capri Sun and a handful of Gushers and invite your friends over to play.
Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	 A lot can change in almost 30 years of gaming, but a good platformer is forever. Initially released in 1989 for the Sega MasterSystem, Wonder Boy 3: The Dragon’s Trap featured all the hallmarks of the (then) up-and-coming genre. Now, the team at Lizardcube has recreated it in painstaking detail - and while The Dragon’s Trap’s design definitely shows its age, it still has a few wonders in store for us thanks to a solid foundation, aesthetic upgrades, and some much-appreciated updates to the original programming.   Your character, the titular Wonder Boy - or, in a nice added touch of inclusiveness, Wonder Girl - is cursed by a robot dragon (because the ‘80s) and turned into a fire-breathing lizard-man/woman (again, ‘80s). To lift the curse, they’ll need to defeat more dragons to transform back into their human form and rid the land of their evil. It’s not a particularly compelling story, but given that it’s pulled from an era when “go left” was considered plot development, this bizarre backstory provides a lore-friendly excuse for the core mechanic. The gameplay will be familiar to anyone who ever picked up a Metroid or Castlevania game released before 1995, or, more recently, Ori and the Blind Forest. Beginning with next to nothing, you fight your way through several areas connected via a central hub, stabbing snakes,crabs, ghosts, and other assorted monsters to collect new equipment and hunt down dragons that serve as boss creatures. Making your way through each sector is a satisfying exercise in patient advancement. With limited health, I had to attack cautiously, striking at just the right moment after learning and avoiding enemy attacks, which made combat feel more like Dark Souls than Donkey Kong. After reaching and defeating each dragon, you’ll transform into new creatures with different abilities, such as a mouse that can climb walls or a fish-man that can swim, which in turn allows you to reach new areas and stab differently colored crabs, ghosts, and dragons. Oh, and ninjas, which don’t really fit the whole “Monster Land” theme considering that you start out fighting what’s basically a knock-off MechaGodzilla I’m not going to try to over-analyze it. Each addition grants you new tactics, which, without the advantage of modern popup tutorials, are fun to puzzle out while exploring each new location.   The style of the updated art is somewhere between hand-drawn fan sketches and a Disney movie, which works well given the vague fantasy setting. The character designs, both of the various animal incarnations of our hero and the many enemies you’ll encounter throughout your four- to six-hour adventure, all exude cartoonish personalities that fit well into the ridiculous “story.” For example, a fire-spewing cloud that once just had vague dark shapes for eyes now sports a pair of cool-guy shades and a smug grin, making it extra satisfying to knock them out of the sky. Similarly, each of the environments are beautifully rendered and possess a unique feel and implied backstory, such as massive statues depicting ancient heroes or sprawling cities beyond what was once just “Forest” or “Desert.” This is especially evident when swapping back and forth from the 2017 art style and the “retro” mode, which allows you to experience Wonder Boy as it was initially released, complete with a chiptune soundtrack - which has been re-recorded as an orchestral score in one of the best musical adaptations in recent memory . It’s a cool and impressive feature - you can even input checkpoint codes from the original release - that really demonstrates the development team’s love of the original game, similar to what we’ve seen in the Monkey Island Special Editions and Oddworld: New ‘N’ Tasty.   In some cases, however, this devotion to the source material is a double-edged sword. While it’s clearly a heartfelt and faithful recreation of the original game, it could have made use of a few simple mechanics that have become somewhat standardized over the past 30 years. Forcing us to grind for randomly dropped items, for instance, may have been an acceptable way to extend playtime in 1990, but in 2017 it seems arbitrary and annoying that I’m not able to purchase them in shops, especially since I only need them to reach one boss fight. On a technical level, Lizardcube may have updated player hitboxes and rebalanced some physics issues from the original, but there were moments (especially in some boss battles) where it seemed my attacks were failing to land at random, regardless of how well-timed or on-target my strikes were. These issues weren’t egregious enough to make me cry foul or rage-quit, but they did remind me of just how good we have things in the modern age of platformers. I had just as much fun during my six- or seven-hour playthrough of Wonder Boy: The Dragon’s Trap as I have with many of its contemporary counterparts. While its antiquated roots cause some minor frustration with unreliable hitboxes and unnecessary grinding, the foundational combat and exploration is still engaging and fun after 30 years. From long-time Wonder Boy fans to platformer enthusiasts who’ve never heard of it until now, you’ll likely be able to find whimsical fun and a neat bit of genre history in this charming adventure.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	" There's a wonderful scene toward the start of Voodoo Vince where our hero, a raggedy voodoo doll newly brought to life through magic, grabs a trumpet and shades and ambles up to a skeleton jazzman with a trumpet of his own. Much like this remastered version bridging the 14-year gap since Vince's first appearance on the original Xbox, it's a meeting of the old and new, and it works well. For a few wonderful seconds the pair slips into a jazz duet that's so dang cool I half forgot I was playing a game, and that moment is what's stuck with me several hours later. That's the remastered version of Voodoo Vince for you. This might be a fairly by-the-numbers platformer, but its unique personality makes it tough to get out of your head. Voodoo Vince Remastered is a remaster in the truest sense of the word – you'll find no new levels, bosses, or challenges lurking among the tweaks. That means it's also as short as it ever was, with a thorough playthrough demanding only around eight hours. I find that barely matters, though, since Vince has been off the radar for so long that it almost feels new. Games with a more ""realistic"" art style might suffer after such a long absence, but Voodoo Vince's vaguely Pixarian look allows it to enter the modern age with only a few signs of wrinkles. It looks all the more modern with a new 1080p resolution, 16:9 aspect ratio, and generally steady 60fps frame rate that holds its course on both the PC and Xbox One versions.   Nothing makes Voodoo Vince a joy to play quite like the music. These improved visuals are important, as there's no better reason to play Voodoo Vince than to revel in its style. Vince's adventures unfold in a warped version of New Orleans' French Quarter and its surrounding swamps, and he's called on to rescue his creator, Madam Charmaine, after the goons of a long-faced jerk named Kosmo the Inscrutable kidnap her and run off with her zombie dust. It nails the imagery, from a crazy take on Jackson Square where eerie cracks pierce the cobblestones to jaunts through swamps where Vince must make precarious leaps to pick up items for extra lives. Yet nothing makes Voodoo Vince a joy to play quite like the music, which peppers each of the six zones with Dixieland jazz that's always catchy and seldom intrusive. Voodoo Vince’s personality further manifests itself in the many puzzles, which might have Vince turning a clock ahead to the right time so he can visit a jazz club for items to complete a level, or riding in a minecart on a subterranean clothesline where he needs to pick up dozens of shirts. It's got some deadpan humor, too, although it's often a bit on the lame side. At one point Vince comes across a turtle scientist bragging about his supposedly great genius, and Vince's witty reply is merely that he can figure out that he's making a balloon.   Strictly speaking, combat isn't even that fun. Naturally, Vince has to hunt down the supplies for this balloon (and other items, depending on zone), and it's moments like these when Voodoo Vince rolls into action. Developer Beep Industries' game was often lightly chastised back in the day because its action barely differed from games that were already on shelves, and that much remains true. Vince spends most of his time bouncing from platform to platform collecting optional items like vials of dust to give him more health or pages that unlock an item that gives him more powers, and his basic skillset includes old standbys like double jumps, spins, head stomps, and the ability to slowly glide down while falling. Strictly speaking, that combat isn't even that fun. Vince's punches feel as though they hit only a little harder than what you'd expect from a dude made out of burlap, and he can usually ignore and run past most of the enemies he comes across anyway unless he wants to pummel them a bit to regain health or other boosts from the items that drop. Even bosses, while fun to look at, barely pose a challenge until the end. But Voodoo Vince is not without its own identity. Being a voodoo doll, Vince harms others when he harms himself, and environmental puzzles sometimes lead him to, say, slam an anvil on himself in order to smash a malevolent piggy bank. Vince also picks up around 30 ""voodoo powers"" in his journeys through exploration or hidden bosses, and there's great fun in finding which one randomly goes off when you pull both triggers on a gamepad. Sometimes a chainsaw might appear and chop Vince in half, simultaneously causing every enemy in the vicinity to share in the horror. There's William Tell, where a hail of arrows hits everything on Vince (and the enemies around him) except the apple on his head. It's all a bit macabre, but it's pulled off in such a perfect Looney Tunes fashion that it always prompts laughter rather than disgust. And that's the bulk of Voodoo Vince. It's a relatively short, simple platformer, but it oozes with personality and a constant sense of fun that tend to make it more memorable than some of its peers. Voodoo Vince's action doesn't deviate much from the standard conventions of early 21st-century platformers, but its jazzy music and bizarre New Orleans look render it a memorable experience. With modernized textures, resolution, aspect ratio, and frame rate, this remastered version updates Vince for a new generation, and hopefully ensures he won't get buried like he was in his former incarnation as an Xbox exclusive."
TJ Hafer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	 Marvel’s interstellar, ragtag Guardians of the Galaxy prove a natural fit for the style of storytelling Telltale puts out these days - and it doesn’t take long into Episode 1: Tangled Up in Blue to recognize why. It manages to pull together some of the best elements of the comic books, the Guardians film adaptations, and Telltale’s ability to deploy well-paced and witty comedy with just enough interactivity to make you feel like a part of the action. Like Telltale’s recent Batman game, this version of the Guardians doesn’t seem to be ripped directly from either the comics or the movies but is rather a respectful pastiche that skews heavily toward the latter. Rocket, Groot, and Drax are almost indistinguishable from their cinematic incarnations, while Peter Quill, Gamora, and Yondu (the blue guy with the big red mohawk-thing on his head) incorporate a lot more traits from their paper-and-ink equivalents. There are also lots of small, clever easter eggs to find for devoted comics fans, which I definitely appreciated.  The voice acting is applause-worthy, especially Nolan North as Rocket. Despite North’s voice being heard in just about every video game ever, he turns it into something so energetic and over the top here that I wouldn’t have known it was him if I hadn’t been told ahead of time. It's a spot-on replication of Bradley Cooper’s endearing and memorable performance from the film. Scott Porter’s version of Peter Quill/Star-Lord, the primary hero, is a little lighter on the quippy delivery than Chris Pratt but brings a relatable, emotional depth to the character that fills in the gaps.  The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown early in the episode is a major highlight. Guardians’ gameplay doesn’t stray too far outside the Telltale formula we’ve come to expect, with only minor but welcome additions like Peter’s rocket boots allowing vertical exploration in some areas. There are semi-tedious detective segments where you wander around looking for the right thing to click on that make me long for the more difficult, puzzle-focused challenges of adventure games past. There are quippy, well-paced conversations with timed dialogue that affect various characters’ impressions of you. And then there are the extended quick-time events which, while they don’t involve any twists beyond hitting buttons really quickly at the right time, are some of the best Telltale has put together, presentation-wise. The big, knock-down, drag-out showdown with one of Marvel’s most iconic supervillains early in the episode is a major highlight. You get the joy of controlling each of the guardians and their unique abilities in an alternating fashion, becoming part of an exciting, well-choreographed brawl that looks like it could have come right off the pages of a comic. When Drax’s fists aren’t flying, and Rocket isn’t pointing a firearm three times his size at anything that moves, Peter is forced to step in (with your guidance) to hold a group of big personalities together through a time that calls into question what their place in the galaxy really is. It’s impossible to keep everyone happy all the time, and some of your friends will be almost literally at each other’s throats by the episode’s end, forcing you to take a side. We’ll have to see how impactful these choices end up being in later episodes – it says Rocket will remember that I didn’t want to do his crazy, dumb plan, but it’s entirely possible everyone will be singing Kumbaya when the credits roll no matter how poor a leader I was. That would be unfortunate in terms of making our choices matter within the story, but for now at least Telltale has done a good job of making these decisions feel important and causing me plenty of enjoyable stress from trying to step up and do what a captain’s gotta do amidst all the intra-team drama.  The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands. That mood is kept light by Guardians’ comic relief. The humor is thin on the ground at times, but when it lands, it really lands. There are at least a couple moments I laughed out loud at, and most of the dialogue writing is as clever and satisfying as the music choices, which delightfully echo the soundtrack of feelgood classic rock director James Gunn put together for the Guardians movies. Where the writing chops behind the episode really show, though, is in the more emotional and character-driven scenes. Intimate conversations between long-time friends experiencing big changes are authentic and moving. Particularly, a flashback scene between a young Peter and his mother felt all too real, injecting a grounded, well-executed B-plot about a kid who’s still not over losing a parent into the swashbuckling space opera.  One of my only other disappointments was how quickly it seemed like Tangled Up in Blue came and went. The bombastic, action-movie pacing worked well in some ways, but also prevented me from feeling like I really got to settle into and experience the world Telltale created as much as I did in the pilots for their take on Game of Thrones or any of the Walking Dead seasons. I look forward to returning and seeing the continued aftershocks of the multiple, major plot stingers (which are worth not spoiling for yourself!) as I chill with a likable, ably written and acted cast in future installments. Guardians of the Galaxy is definitely starting off on the right foot, with a great script, great actors, and a universe packed with personality (and backed by catchy tunes) to explore. If it can continue to deliver the quality of dialogue and panel-perfect action over the course of the rest of the season, it may find itself seated in the upper echelons of Telltale’s catalog. I just hope that now the series has introduced itself, the series gives its environments and characters just a bit more time to breathe in between speeding the plot along.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/lego-city-undercover-review-2	 When we first reviewed LEGO City Undercover for Wii U in March 2013, we declared it great and awarded it an 8.0 out of 10. Here’s what we said then:   LEGO City Undercover is the best iteration of a very familiar experience, which is as reassuring or problematic as that might seem. The sheer scope of the overworld is impressive, as is the way Traveller’s Tales layered in its wide range of collectible goodies, which ensures hours upon hours of activity after the campaign ends, which should take the average player about 10 hours, accounting for some collectible fetching. Undercover’s story is an incredibly entertaining homage to countless movies and television shows, and manages to feature a very strong cast of characters – no small feat considering the game has no major license associated with it. Of course, rampant loading times, no co-op and a variety of other problems (loading times, routine gameplay) hold Undercover back from truly taking the next step for the larger LEGO franchise.   That’s still for the most point where we stand on it today, with the main difference being the inclusion of local two-player co-operative play for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and PC versions of the game. This brings the updated release of LEGO City Undercover more in line with the vast majority of LEGO titles from Traveler’s Tales, as a second player can now drop in and drop out at any point.  Admittedly co-op support in LEGO City Undercover is pretty barebones. Rather than introduce a second character into the game’s story, player two is just a palette-swapped version of main hero Chase McCain. Furthermore there are no specific missions, puzzles, or activities designed to cater to co-operative play, it’s the exact same content as the Wii U version only it can be tackled with two of you brick-smashing your way to success instead of one. Having said that, it’s still a fun sandbox to muck around in with a second player particularly given the presence of some 100 different vehicles to thrash about, and certainly the addition of co-op helps to make this re-release of LEGO City Undercover superior to the original to some degree. The only other major difference is the migration of the Wii U’s second screen features onto a single screen. LEGO City Undercover hardly made the most of the Wii U Gamepad anyway, so these tweaks have a fairly minor impact on the experience as a whole. It’s certainly more convenient to have video communications windowed in the corner of the main screen rather than having to keep looking down in your lap while you’re driving somewhere, and although controlling the environment scanner with thumbsticks isn’t quite as fun as physically holding up the Gamepad was, it’s no less functional. (It does however seem slightly odd that Chase McCain’s slab-like police communicator device still looks exactly like the Wii U Gamepad it was originally designed to imitate.)  Each version of the re-released LEGO City Undercover runs at 1080p (including the Switch version, when docked) and at a more stable frame rate compared to the original (with the exception of the un-docked Switch version, which features a slightly choppier frame rate reminiscent of the Wii U original). The visuals are otherwise unchanged, but I wasn’t exactly expecting the addition of high resolution textures or anything since well, almost everything in the game is made out of smooth-surfaced LEGO bricks. What I had hoped for was some level of optimisation for the load times, but unfortunately this doesn’t appear to be an area that developer TT Fusion has given much love. While it varies marginally between platforms, LEGO City Undercover still features generally sluggish load times. Even the Switch version, which I downloaded digitally and have running off a high speed Micro SD card, can still take anywhere from 30 seconds to a full minute when transitioning from an interior to the open world, which is a lengthy period of time to regularly stare at a static screen no matter how much you enjoy the incredibly funky ‘70s wah-wah wocka-ing that accompanies it. If you’ve already played the original LEGO City Undercover on Wii U, then there is little reason to pick up this re-release. However, if you were one of the many who missed it the first time around then LEGO City Undercover remains a hilarious riff on police procedurals, built upon a GTA-for-juniors open world blueprint, and stuffed with enjoyable side missions and collectibles to hunt down. The addition of split-screen play, cursory in its execution as it may be, only makes the game more appealing to players who would prefer to experience LEGO City Undercover with a friend riding shotgun. And what's a good police story without a partner in crime-fighting?
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	 The simple act of moving through the vibrant, colorful world of Snake Pass is as mesmerizing to play as it is to watch. This physics-based puzzle platformer uses a simple, intuitive control scheme to maneuver a snake up onto objects in a way that made me think about how to approach each one. Even when the camera couldn’t keep up or the stingy checkpoint system tested my patience, Snake Pass still kept me coming back to master its controls and reach its many well-hidden collectibles.  Snake Pass still kept me coming back to master its controls The concept of having fine control over the muscle movements of a serpent sounds bizarre, but is easy to understand thanks to the three-button system that allows you to slither around on the ground, climb up bamboo structures, and travel across hanging poles. The snake, adorably named Noodle, uses one button to move forward while another lets you lift your head. By carefully tilting the analog stick in between the other two movements, you learn to find the right angle and figure out a way to naturally coil around objects in the world. The logic behind these controls shines when you’re climbing, since the more points of contact you have with an object, the easier it is to make your way up. It’s fascinating to watch.   What makes it feel distinctive to play is that you have to think like a snake to succeed. Since Noodle is essentially one slippery, elongated muscle, you’ll move slowly if you stretch yourself out too far and you’ll slip off of objects if you aren’t careful. You have to slither back and forth like a snake would to move forward quickly, and it made total sense. But conquering the 15-stage campaign is a tough, five-hour platforming challenge because you have to grasp moving around in such a nontraditional way. One you get your bearings, tricky sequences that involve hanging onto moving objects for dear life will be the most brutal test of your snakey skills. It’s seriously daunting platforming at first, but it only seems impossible. Once you learn to make small adjustments using the analog triggers on the controller, for instance, it gets much easier to cross structures. Overcoming these challenges gave me confidence to try riskier maneuvers like distributing my weight quickly across a hanging beam to then wrap myself around it.  The aggravating checkpoint system often left me raging But while you can move with the grace and speed of a snake, the camera moves like a slug. It constantly shifts to bad viewing angles that can very easily get you killed. When that or any other cause of death strikes you’re respawned almost instantly, but the aggravating checkpoint system often left me raging. It’s not that getting sent back a ways was the worst thing in the world, but losing all of the collectibles I’d picked up along the way is a kick in the teeth. Like any good platformer Snake Pass is heavy on collectibles, and some are cleverly hidden in tough-to-reach places. Falling into a pit will dump every prior thing you’ve picked up, often forcing you to repeat tough puzzles over and over after the slightest mishap. Admittedly, the repetition made me a better Snake Pass player, but it also scared me off from ever going near some collectibles if there wasn’t a checkpoint nearby.   As you’d expect, the PC and PS4 Pro versions are the best looking versions of Snake Pass, with options for higher display resolutions and better lighting. Both also support for 60 frames per second, but Snake Pass looks fine on a PS4 and Xbox One at 1080p 30fps. The Switch version has slightly fewer shadows and lighting effects, but the colorful stages look good on the system in docked or handheld mode. Slithering up simple structures in Snake Pass is one of the most mechanically satisfying video game ideas I’ve ever experience, and it effectively creates a sensation that feels the way maneuvering like a snake might. The camera and checkpoint systems aren’t great, but the concept still managed to hook me for the five hours it took wrap up the campaign. And in the end, I wanted to go back and replay stages to round up all the collectibles I missed.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	 When it’s at its best, Yooka-Laylee reminds me of why 3D platformers have been one of my favorite game genres for the past two decades. Its colorful worlds, vibrant and funny characters, and generally smart and entertaining level design often had me grinning as I remembered my times with games like its not-so-thinly-veiled inspiration, Banjo-Kazooie. But while I enjoyed my 15 hours in the world created by developer Playtonic, I was bummed to notice camera issues, some bland activities, and small number of worlds that keep Yooka-Laylee from reaching the heights of its predecessors. Like the iconic 3D platformers of the 64-bit era, Yooka-Laylee follows a very familiar and much-appreciated formula. You have your hub world, which acts as a sprawling maze that teaches you the basic mechanics before allowing you to really stretch your legs in a handful of huge, colorful stages. You explore the spaces, gather hundreds of different knick-knacks that can be used to purchase new abilities, discover new worlds, and unlock fun retro-arcade games that can be played locally with up to three other pals in a mode separate from the main campaign.   I’m a big fan of the sheer amount and variety of abilities that the two characters you control simultaneously, Yooka and Laylee, amass over the course of the campaign. Their relationship is both cute and functionally similar to that of Banjo and Kazooie: Yooka is a heroic lizard who does most of the heavy lifting, while Laylee is a sarcastic bat with abilities like a sonar ray that unlocks invisible objects, and a brief invincibility barrier that act as support. Standard platforming stuff like double jumps, flight, and a ground pound are joined by some surprising new additions that I really appreciated. For example, Yooka can temporarily assume the properties of certain objects that you lick in environment — applying your tongue to honey, for instance, makes you sticky, allowing you to walk across slick surfaces. Powers like this make for some really interesting puzzles, especially when paired with other temporarily abilities like shooting out flaming projectiles. It was satisfying to come to a puzzle, experiment with the objects nearby, and eventually come to creative solution. The whole time, though, you have to wrestle against the fact that the controls and physics never feel quite as polished as the old-school Mario, Banjo, or Ratchet games. There were several times where I failed challenge, not because of a fault of my own, but because of slight collision, timing, and camera issues. That’s a problem, considering that platforming is the crux of everything you do here, including the exploration. While it’s never outright bad, there are moments when it becomes increasingly frustrating when it stacks with a camera that occasionally gets locked in geometry and actively fought back as I tried to get a better view of my surroundings and challenges. It’s not 1998 anymore, and the second a game’s camera becomes noticeable is when it becomes an issue. This happened to me a bit too often throughout my adventure.   Camera aside, one of my main gripes with Yooka is that there are only five worlds to explore outside of the hub. That’s definitely a disappointment, especially when you factor in that one of the five is flat-out not good. The fourth, a sprawling casino, is disappointingly lifeless considering the gaudy source material. This place is flat, dull, and filled with banal, chance-based tasks like slot machines that grind the pace of the adventure to a halt if you don’t have awesome luck. Given that this world is 20% of the total game, it’s absolutely a letdown. Thankfully, the other four worlds each pull their weight, from Mayan ruins that sprawl out on a series of floating islands to an icy castle that’s home to a series of fun and surprising challenges that call back to early, lesser-known Rare games from the ‘80s. And while I’m definitely disappointed in the scant amount of worlds, I really love that each one can be expanded by spending some of the collectibles you find. I got a lot of satisfaction out of exploring a level, learning its intricacies, and collecting everything I could get my hands on, only to watch the entire thing double in size and offer up a whole new bunch of challenges. The constant cycle of exploring and gathering currency which can then be used to expand the levels, allowing you to explore and gather more is really satisfying, as is physically seeing a location change. For example, a locked castle in the ice world suddenly opens up, offering dozens of new and unexpected challenges. Each of the worlds is massive – easily bigger than any of the stages in the original Banjo – and apart from the casino, they’re crammed with interesting activities to engage with in exchange for doo-dads and knick-knacks. From minecart challenges that harken back to Donkey Kong Country to some fun and clever boss fights against giant enemies brimming with personality, each one forcing me to master a handful of Yooka’s abilities. That said, there are a handful of annoying tasks, particularly a handful of trivia challenges that take the quiz scene from the original Banjo Kazooie, which many (myself included) consider to be the worst part of that game, and double down on the frustration. Asking me the name of a minor NPC that I didn’t even know had a name, or what my current playtime is and giving me the option of three times that are very close together doesn’t make for a very entertaining quiz. (Source: I run a pub trivia night at a local bar.)   Those few bad apples aside, the writing has the same British charm and wit that we’ve come to express from the ex-Rare developers. Meta-jokes about the genre’s past and Yooka-Laylee's crowdfunding origins are in abundance, and the cast of talking critters throughout the worlds is diverse and memorable. A paranoid narcotics dealing snake named Trowzer sells your new abilities, while a depressed cloud named Nimbus is depressed because his wife left him for a typhoon. The Banjo series has always been known for an eclectic and iconic cast of characters, and Yooka-Laylee absolutely lives up to that pedigree. Speaking of living up to Rare’s legacy, Yooka-Laylee has really great soundtrack that 100% feels like it was recorded in the late ‘90s, which I mean in the best possible way. Coupled with all of the characters making the same weird kinds of noises that I’ve been imitating since the original Banjo, and Yooka-Laylee is a joy to the ears. Yooka-Laylee contains all the pieces needed for a fun, enjoyable throwback to the 3D collectathons of the 64-bit era. The characters are charming and funny, your set of abilities is vast and entertaining, and four out of five of the worlds are fun playgrounds to explore. While it lacks the heart and polish of some of its incredible predecessors, it’s a good reminder that this genre, once thought to be dead, still has some life left in it.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	" So a warrior, a monk, and a rogue walk onto a battlefield and then... they die. A lot. And then they have to start all over. That's been the punchline of so many of my attempts with Has Been Heroes, and while I may have laughed a couple of times in my first few hours and enjoyed some of the good ideas put forth, my goodwill has become a has-been itself. It's bruised my admiration of the otherwise-appealing premise of this roguelike lane-brawler to the point that right now I’m content to let these heroes remain the has-beens the title says they are. We get to hear relatively little about that. Story is hardly a strong point in Has Been Heroes, and it's chiefly limited to a handful of cutscenes with cartoony illustrations in which we hear about how the titular heroes used to be great warriors who slew dragons and giant spiders and performed other feats of derring do. Now, though, decades after their prime, the best they can hope for is escorting two princesses to school.   It's not a bad premise, and in the right hands it could even have been funny. It's not a bad premise, and in the right hands it could even have been funny. For the most part, though, Has Been Heroes leaves that potential limited to a smattering of lame one-liners you read in text boxes as the little band works its way across the maps. The maps themselves aren't that impressive, either. Sure, it's nice that they alternate from snowy fields to dark swamps, but I never found any visual touches that made me stop in awe like I did with developer Frozenbyte's previous impressive visual design in Trine. If anything, it kind of looks like what you'd expect from a standard mobile game. There's still a ghost of Trine's design floating about here, though, since the gameplay essentially relies on playing all three heroes at once. Each runs toward the right in their own lane, while the enemies trudge their way left like zombies marching toward plants. As in Trine, your crew is motley bunch, with the warrior dealing out massive damage in one hit, the monk knocking out two fairly weak hits, and a rogue dishing out three medium attacks. In theory, at least, this makes for a fun setup that holds up well in the first couple of hours. Almost all the enemies marching leftward have stamina bars that must be whittled down before the heroes can knock down their health bars, and the characters usually need to change who occupies which lane in order to take turns whittling them down. You can only switch out while one character is attacking, though, and this is so crucial that Has Been Heroes rightfully pauses the action after each attack. You then switch another hero into the lane to (hopefully) finish them off. In practice, this means I might knock a few stamina points off with the monk, send in the rogue to knock the stamina bar all the way down, and then, once the health bar is exposed, send the warrior rushing in to knock off the majority of the enemy's health.  After an hour or so I became familiar enough with this little dance to sometimes ignore the oh-so-helpful option to pause before making a move. There is a bit of a learning curve, though, and the spartan tutorial does little to explain moderately helpful strategies like switching a hero currently in play to a lane with enemies that are ""behind"" him or her while he's attacking so as to hit them on the way back to the left. Figuring that out for myself took a while, and some simple instruction would’ve made my opening hours much more fun. It doesn't help that the controls never really became second nature. On an Xbox controller you use the X,Y, and A buttons to select and swap the lanes, B to attack, the left bumper to pause, and the right to cast spells. Even hours in, I still found myself taking annoying amounts of time to get the heroes in the proper lanes I wanted them in.  But here's the main bummer of Has Been Heroes: gosh, it's hard. But here's the main bummer of Has Been Heroes: gosh, it's hard. Don’t get me wrong: I appreciate a good challenge, and I often opt to play games on hard mode for the first time. But there are limits: I spent a couple of hours trying to get past the first boss of Has Been Heroes, and honestly, I've yet to beat the giant skeleton with a bandana on his skull. The only times I've been able to get past that boss encounter have been the times when the random level generation has given me a mage-type boss instead. He’s no pushover either – he randomly switches lanes and spawns shadows who can kill you in one hit (although luckily they die in one hit as well). When it's the big skeleton guy and his horde of other skeletons, I get easily overwhelmed. And then I die. And then it's back to the beginning. That’s especially time-consuming because taking the most direct route through a level is the wrong way to play Has Been Heroes – or most other roguelikes, for that matter. Instead, you should explore the various nodes on the randomized maps, buying spells from vendors that appear or opening chests, thereby having an arsenal of potentially devastating spells and items when you arrive at the boss, such as one that shoots out lightning when a hero lands a melee hit. Do that, and you might have a chance. The problem is that, despite my best efforts and best collections, I still often found myself on maps where there were just too many enemies with massive stamina pools to handle properly. And then I had to start over.  Next to something like Darkest Dungeon, it becomes monotonous too quickly. Maybe that wouldn't be such a problem is almost all of the enemies in the early hours weren't just skeletons of some form or another. Some can heal, some have tougher armor, some will throw up shields that can thwart your precious timing while you wait for melee attacks to recharge. Sometimes you'll get barriers or big man-eating plants, but most of the time you're just up against a pile of skellies. Has Been Heroes' strategic strengths manages to sustain the fun for several hours, but in time, this makes for a mind-numbingly dull and repetitive experience. Next to something like Darkest Dungeon, which has several different styles of enemies you can fight in the early hours, it becomes monotonous too quickly. There’s just too much stick and not enough carrot to make this roguelike as addictive as the best of the genre. Needless to say, I never saw the end of it after more than a dozen hours. Making things worse is the fact that Has Been Heroes doesn't even give you information about the items that drop while using a controller – the only way I could find out how to decide which character should pick up an item was by using a mouse while playing on PC. Hardly ideal. I want to like Has Been Heroes. It brings some good ideas to both roguelikes and lane-based games. I even had fun for several hours before the appeal wore off. But after suffering through failure after failure even with my best efforts, I'm fine with these heroes hanging up their swords for good. There are some good ideas in Has Been Heroes, such as the way it uses multi-lane battlefields to make us use strategies that involve switching between the strengths of three different heroes to achieve victory. It's a recipe for fun that manages to last for a while. Eventually, though, the heavy emphasis on the luck of level generation, the frustrations of enemy repetition, the poor tutorial, and the tendency to overrun you with tough enemies spoil the whole. Hard games are great, but there are limits."
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	 Seeking out new life and new civilizations to shoot and have sex with, Mass Effect: Andromeda creatively sidesteps the limitations of Mass Effect 3’s ending by launching a group of pioneers into a whole new galaxy. What they find there is a vast and sometimes exciting action role-playing game that kept me engaged, but after the outstanding trilogy that created this universe, Andromeda is a disappointing follow up with some significant technical issues on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. From the opening moments, there’s an immediate sense of mystery and peril as the human colony ship encounters a massive, world-ruining space anomaly that throws their plans into disarray, and a new hostile alien race led by a threatening villain attacks on sight. The quest to find a habitable and safe new home for tens of thousands of frozen colonists and form a functioning independent government along with colonists from the krogan, salarian, turian, and asari ships is an interesting struggle that sets this Mass Effect apart from the establishments of previous games. At the same time, Andromeda just can’t stop itself from retreading some major plot ideas from the original trilogy, including another long-dead civilization that’s left advanced technology lying around.  What’s bizarre is that BioWare went to the trouble of shipping us 2.5 million light years away to introduce only two new alien races (plus some robots) over more than 50 hours of campaign and major side missions, and only one local joins your crew. Given that the original games have multiple background races like elcor, drell, vorcha, batarians, and more to add diversity and the sense that we were living in a universe full of different peoples, the Andromeda galaxy seems practically barren of intelligent life by comparison.  Ryder is a likable and well-acted character who can carry the story. Our new customizable protagonist, Ryder, quickly finds himself thrust into the leadership role of Pathfinder and placed in command of a ship, the Tempest. (As with Shepard, Ryder can be either a man or a woman, but because my first playthrough was as a guy named Biff with a large ginger afro and a scar that looked as though he’d been hit in the face with a hot waffle iron, I’m going to refer to him as male in this review.) On the whole, Ryder is a likable and well-acted character who can carry the story, and the idea of having the alternate-gender version of your character play a role in the story as a twin sibling is a novel idea and used to good effect. It can also be ridiculous if you choose to use the character creator to make the twins appear as completely different races – or just freakishly deformed, tattooed, and scarred. Most of the early dialogue choices we have to shape our version of Ryder are about how we want him to cope with this harrowing situation, and the options are usually either cocky overconfidence or self-doubt and pity without a lot in between. But eventually it evens out, and we get to choose between idealistic Ryder and pragmatic Ryder as we resolve conflicts throughout the region. The choices are rarely as high-contrast as the original trilogy’s Paragon/Renegade moments, and they’re more about deciding whether you want him to be an all-business logical type or a goofball with a self-deprecating sense of humor and cheesy jokes.  Your crew, meanwhile, is a fairly generic band made up almost entirely of existing Mass Effect humans and aliens, which despite their fairly deep and enjoyable backstories, always gave me feelings of deja vu. After all, how many times can we be introduced to a gruff new krogan warrior or an eyepiece-wearing turian? There’s nothing really wrong with them, but none struck me as memorable stars like Garrus, Tali, or Mordin. Peebee is probably the best of the cast thanks to her quirky humor and tendency to bicker with her fellow asari, Lexi. But the rest seem too comfortable with each other to be all that interesting in the way we saw with Wrex threatening to tear the team apart in the original Mass Effect. Everyone getting along, for the most part, is a little boring, regardless of how flirty and naked they get.  And my stars, do they ever get naked. And my stars, do they ever get naked. I’m not just talking about Liam’s apparent allergy to shirts, here. You have plenty of romance options for either gender, including same-sex and interspecies, and when you’ve gone out of your way to talk to them and run errands for them (which often involve blowing up robots or killing outlaws) to kindle the flames of your budding relationship, you’re treated to a full-on R-rated sex scene the likes of which the Mass Effect series has never seen before. My wife’s reaction as I sealed the deal with human biotic commando Cora was to state, matter-of-factly, that, “This is porn. And it looks weird.” She’s not wrong on either count – especially since male Ryder appears to have painstakingly removed every hair on his body below the neck – but I’d call it tasteful porn thanks to the context of the conversations leading up to it. Voice acting is almost universally strong enough that I quickly stopped noticing the generally sub-par human facial animations. Could they be better? Absolutely – a lot of games, such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, have done significantly better in that department and in giving characters hair that doesn’t look like solid plastic. But some weird expressions didn’t ruin Mass Effect: Andromeda for me any more than they did virtually every RPG for the past three decades. I’m much more distracted by the texture pop-in that happens during conversations, where a character’s face will go from looking like a blurry mess to having visible pores midway through a sentence. On that note, Mass Effect: Andromeda is more than a little rough in the technical sense. On PlayStation 4 and Xbox One (I’ve yet to spend significant time with the PC version), it’s prone to major frame rate drops and hitches regardless of what’s happening on screen. I’ve seen it drop to slideshow levels when simply walking around the Nexus (the Citadel-like seat of government), driving through a flat wasteland, and fighting in a dense jungle. Animation glitches seem more common than in previous games. And, though some bugs are to be expected in a game of this scale, between myself and a few other players at IGN we’ve seen a fair share of broken quests. (BioWare has been aggressively issuing patches in response to our reports and claims to have resolved at least some of the problems already.)  Those moments are right up there with the toughest head-scratchers of the original trilogy. Overall, though, the inconsistent writing is what makes this Mass Effect a rollercoaster of ups and downs. Occasionally, we’re confronted with excellent morally gray questions where both options have compelling logic and terrible consequences, where you’re forced to pick between, for instance, a long-term greater good or saving lives. Those are some of the best moments in all of Mass Effect: Andromeda and they’re right up there with the toughest head-scratchers of the original trilogy. I’d have loved to have seen more of them. There are also some respectable quests, such as discovering the truth behind the first murder in Andromeda using your Batman-style scanner on your wrist-mounted Omnitool and then deciding what to do with the results of your investigation. Having finished the campaign, however, very few of these no-win choices have come back to haunt me in the ways I’d hoped for. In between those decisions are a large number of filler fetch and kill quests set up by stilted conversations, and those can become tedious as you try to fill up the viability percentages of the planets you visit. Plus, flying around in the Tempest and scanning uninhabited planets for resources is as dull a task as it’s been in any of the original trilogy games – and that’s saying a lot. But at least this time they’re over quickly; extracting resources is a two-button job, and if there’s nothing to be found you’ll know right away, without needing to waste time searching. Because of the semi-open structure of the campaign, it’s more or less up to us to do different things in order to keep things fresh.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/flatout-4-total-insanity-review	 FlatOut 4: Total Insanity didn’t have to do much to be better than its irredeemably dire predecessor. To be frank, that’s only because FlatOut 3: Chaos & Destruction – released way back in 2011 after a franchise ownership and developer change – is one of the worst racing games ever released. Still, new studio Kylotonn has done a decent job here salvaging the comatose series, turning it back into a serviceable but repetitive smash ’em up-slash-stunt racer.    Kylotonn has stuck to the FlatOut style guide here, crafting a game that’s very much in-step with the likes of the first two; you know, the good ones. The presentation remains inspired in almost every way by Bugbear’s cult-favourites, from the style of the menu screens to the colourful and busy stunt arena.  It’s definitely the stunt arena where FlatOut 4 sticks closest to the series’ earlier spirit. It’s definitely the stunt arena where FlatOut 4 sticks closest to the series’ earlier spirit. These ragdoll physics games are dating a bit but they’re still good fun here, and the stadium is filled with 12 ridiculous, driver-tossing minigames like curling, beer pong, billiards, and more. I particularly dig ‘Finnish Pins’, which demands both skill and strategy to achieve the correct score of exactly 25. I also really like the golf minigame (scoring a hole-in-one is truly satisfying, and so is nailing your driver’s landing and subsequent slide to reach the furthest greens). I’m confused by the likes of long jump, however, which has a net at the end of the landing zone and thus a maximum distance that can be regularly reached and never beaten. Scoring exactly 25 points takes some serious tactics. You can either tackle these stunts solo, seeking to rule the online leaderboards, or hit them up in pass-the-controller couch multiplayer. It’s good that FlatOut 4 packs a bespoke, same-screen multiplayer stunt mode because if any mode is going to claim even the temporary attention of groups of rowdy revheads and Rocket League lovers, it’ll be this one. The racing itself is a bit less interesting overall. The tracks themselves are reasonably reminiscent of those found in the old games – debris-filled courses snaking through forests, factories, cluttered lumber yards, a dusty red desert, and frozen towns – but none are especially memorable. The big problem with the tracks is that they’re quite limited (even with reverse versions) and they don’t really do a lot to distinguish themselves from each other. It didn’t take long at all until I was getting very bored of seeing the same track, either forwards or in reverse, every few races.   FlatOut 4’s arcade handling model is a bit light but mostly adequate, though its AI is slightly less so. It’s not so much that it’s very aggressive (it is, but this is a destruction racer). Rather, it’s inconsistent. On some occasions, after becoming embroiled in some bedlam on the start line, I’d often find myself struggling to catch the frontrunners despite putting in mistake-free laps (if you get turned around or trapped in a first corner pile-up, just restart the race). Other times I’d get out ahead and gallop away, winning by 10 seconds or more. They’re fairly easily outfoxed in things like Capture the Flag, too (driving high and fast on the near-vertical walls of the destruction bowls really messes with their minds). The AI drivers aren't quite clever enough to catch you up here. They can mount a reasonable resistance in FlatOut 4’s deathmatch and destruction derby games but I’m not a huge fan of the way they play out. They’re a bit shallow; cars become virtual missiles, boosting and crunching through doomed opponents like paper. I would definitely prefer something with a better sense of weight, with collisions that feel real. Something more like previous FlatOut custodian Bugbear’s authentic, slower, and more tactical approach with its similarly destruction-centric racer Wreckfest, even if that game has been in Steam Early Access for going on 400 years now.   My biggest disappointment with FlatOut 4 is how rapidly I grew exhausted with the career mode. Career Mode is broken into three tiers, beginning in the derby class where grids consist of rusty, rolling wrecks. It didn’t take long until I was lapping the same handful of tracks in the same car, to the same music, and it just becomes a chore. There are twists on the racing, like a beat-the-bomb distance challenge and a chaotic but acceptable weapons-based race called Assault, but it all became a grind quicker than I figured it would. It doesn’t help that the payouts are so stingy, either. In the first tier I found myself reluctant to buy a second derby car because I didn’t feel I could spare so much of my meagre winnings, even for coming first in all championships. Instead I concentrated on upgrading my initial car and saving the large sum required for a car in the next class instead, hoping for some fresh racing. There's not enough track content for a career mode this long. Frustratingly, once I did purchase a car in the next class I discovered the next batch of events are basically a rehash of the first tier, only in a faster car with no rust on it. After an anticlimactic end to the derby series (there’s no fanfare or reward; you’re just dumped back to your menu of completed championships) my enthusiasm for basically doing it all again in a different car was minimal. Outside of Career Mode is FlatOut Mode, a chain of individual stunt and racing events. It’s basically a second career mode, but it does do a better job of putting us in different cars more often. Annoyingly FlatOut 4 locks a lot of its vehicles and is slow to unlock them. It also doesn’t effectively communicate the circumstances that will see them made available for purchase in Career Mode, or use in Quick Play. They just sit there, unobtainable until you meet some mystery criteria. This actually doesn't apply to the online race modes (all the cars are selectable) but this only makes the crippling of Quick Play all the more odd.   There are times FlatOut 4 is quite handsome – some of the lighting effects are fantastic, particularly when the sun is low – but overall it’s a few car lengths behind current visual kingpins of the racing sector. Crunch. Engine notes vary across vehicles, though they could’ve been more aggressive (and there’s an abruptness to the transition from being on and off boost that sounds quite unfinished). Its overall performance seems reliable, besides the occasion flutter around one particular shortcut that has the ability to catch and temporarily trap a big portion of the pack simultaneously. The online racing held up during testing also, though I can't see it going gangbusters for a long period with such a repetitive selection of tracks on offer. FlatOut 4: Total Insanity is better than I’d feared but not as good as I’d hoped. Kylotonn has dredged this near-forgotten racing rebel from the very bottom of the barrel and fashioned it into a basic but fun, stunt-filled speedster, but I found myself regularly frustrated with its repetitive career mode, its stingy economy and nebulous unlockables, its superficial demolition derby events, and its uneven difficulty. A respectable franchise rescue mission but one that still needs some fine tuning and some extra grunt.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review	" Styx the goblin tells some utterly awful jokes, with one of the tamest (and lamest) sounding off straight after an accidental death where he pops up on the loading screen and asks, ""Is that a controller in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?"" I can forgive it, though. After all, he's the only member of his race who's intelligent enough to speak and make stale Assassin's Creed and Terminator references, and he thus really has no one else to tell him how corny he sounds. That, and he's an amazing thief and assassin whose shadowy neck-breaking skills more than make up for its occasional bad pun. The whole of Styx: Shards of Darkness is a little like that: an eye roll one moment, and welcome suspense and stealthy action the next. For such an ugly little squatter, Styx lives in an attractive world. The broad strokes – a world filled with elves, dwarves, and humans – resemble classic J.R.R.Tolkien, but the fantasy universe developer Cyanide Studios presents here is a dark one suited to a game so drenched in shadows. Styx might wisecrack a lot (including some which I’ll admit are genuinely funny), but it almost comes off as a defense mechanism in this cruel world with duplicitous shapeshifters and bloody elven rituals meant to appease giant millipedes worshiped as gods.   Styx's fourth-wall-breaking humor resembles a small green Deadpool. Some folks will hate him and his foul-mouthed Family Guy-caliber quips, but I love him. In cutscenes and in fourth-wall breaking remarks he comes off as the only person who's really getting the joke, kind of like a small green Deadpool. He's a weirdly appealing foil to all the dour folks around him, all of whom are trying to swindle each other for control of the precious amber so much of this world – including stealth abilities – runs on. None of the characters are particularly awful, but Styx himself is so wonderfully far ahead of them in terms of characterization, voice acting, animation, and humor that just listening to the audio feels a bit like listening to a Mystery Science Theater 3000 viewing of a straight-faced film. A fairly decent story follows Styx through nine missions over roughly 15 hours as he buddies up with a group that's nominally committed to the eradication of his race and quickly leads down deeper rabbit holes. Sometimes Shards of Darkness introduces a humorous mission, such as when Styx needs to haul a drunken captain to his ship, but most of the time the tale itself is full of weighty themes that might not be apparent from all the snark rampant in the trailers. Cyanide, unfortunately, doesn't use this rich setting to its full potential. The opening hours present exploratory wonders of vertical design, complete with Styx shimmying and grappling his away over the rooftops and under the boardwalks of majestic steampunk airships, shabby fishing villages, and gloomy dark elven cities burrowed into peaks. It's a shame the fumbly act of jumping from ledge to ledge in midair comes off as one of Shards of Darkness' weak points, to say nothing of the awfulness of swinging from a rope, but it’s doable. These are lovingly designed levels that take hours to explore fully, and they're stuffed with chests, wardrobes, and baskets for Styx to hide in and alarms to boobytrap. Puzzles requiring memories of earlier cutscenes sometimes deliver awesome new daggers, and trials test Styx's reflexes.  But about halfway through, after Styx has to face down a tough boss with environmental targets that demand the expert use of your avoidance reflexes and knowledge of his abilities, Shards of Darkness essentially starts to recycle the earlier levels. Sometimes Styx will gain access to a section that wasn't available the first time around, but for the most part, the only differences are the introduction of new foes like armored enemies who can't be killed by a dagger or dwarves who can sniff out the smelly Styx if he creeps too close.  The Gollum-like sneaking is the best thing about Shards of Darkness. I usually enjoyed revisiting those locations, though, in part because I find Shards of Darkness' stealth gameplay so appealing. The vertical levels and multiple approaches to assassination suggest a marriage of Assassin's Creed and Hitman, although Styx's tiny, slimy frame allows Shards to craft an identity of its own. The Gollum-like sneaking is the best thing about Shards of Darkness, as it allows our green friend to dart under tables and jump into crannies where his adversaries cannot follow. But it's the secondary abilities where the true fun comes in, and they're unlocked by accumulating points by completing multiple objectives or, say, finishing a level without killing anyone or raising an alarm. They're often lifesavers, as Shards of Darkness presents Styx with new dangers at almost every corner. And yet it's rarely unfair. Styx always has the tools for victory, and they’re delightfully unhygienic. He can barf out and take control of a clone of himself while he stays safely far away, and he can poison guards by spewing bile in their water or food. He can also turn invisible in a tight spot, but it's such a massive, quick drain on the precious amber resource used for many of Styx's powers that it rarely feels overpowered. You can also craft weapons, including helpful traps that take out armored guards, darts that provide some ranged attacks, or lockpicks that help minimize the snooping around for a hidden entrance. The materials for these, though, are all a little rare – that has the nice effect of making sure you never lose sight of the need to stay truly stealthy.  Sometimes, though, Styx may have to fight if he's spotted. That’s never been a strong point of this series, but the glorious thing about Shards of Darkness compared to Master of Shadows is that it doesn't lock you into combat. As before, these fights are mostly a case of waiting to parry against a guard three times your size at the right time, and if you miss, you're dead. (Deaths then triggers one of those many, many hit-or-miss loading-screen taunts.) In Shards of Darkness, Styx is free to say ""to hell with it"" and leave combat by scurrying into shadows without worrying about the camera deciding not to follow him, allowing him time to find another hole to hide in under the alert dies off.  As modern stealth games go, Styx is on the harder side (in a good way). Shards of Darkness constantly emphasizes that fighting should only be a last, desperate resort. The most action your blade will see is from slitting the throats of guards from behind, and that's only if you want to – but dropping some bodies sure makes things easier. As modern stealth games go, Styx is on the harder side (in a good way, at least if you appreciate pure stealth), and the ability to save at any time feels almost like a divine blessing as the automatic checkpoints are laughably far apart. The varied mission requirements also do a fine job of keeping the experience fresh, as they sometimes force Styx to stay stealthy without triggering an alarm or to make his way through a hostile dungeon in nothing but his underwear. Fortunately, these challenges don’t present themselves until you've had ample opportunity to learn Styx's dance of stealth and hasty escapes, and by the time they come, you should be ready for them.   Don't be seen. That's about it. It's a shame the enemies don't differ much from each other. Shards of Darkness includes everything from drunken pirates to heavily armored elves and burly dwarves, but when fighting them or stealthily killing them, they all play about the same. At least the AI is fairly decent this time around, and I remember being shocked when a knight found me and yanked me out from my hidey hole and skewered me with his sword because I'd been too confident and hadn't shrunk further back into the darkness when I first hid there. Sometimes I'd catch them bugged and walking in tiny circles or, most annoyingly, I'd see an ogre standing on air when the trap door he was supposed to fall through opened, but for the most part Shards of Darkness requires no tricks to learn the secrets of its stealth. Don't be seen. That's about it, and as it should be. Shards of Darkness also includes a serviceable two-player cooperative mode, but it works better on some missions more than others. In those where Styx just has to stay completely out of sight, another goblin hanging around can be more frustrating than helpful. The mission will end entirely, just because one goblin was seen, and since the co-op mode doesn't support the ability to save anywhere, it's a recipe for gnashed teeth rather than good times. In standard missions, though, where one player can toss a glass to distract a guard while the other one runs up and kills him while he's turned away, it's immensely rewarding. Even then, though, the animations on the guest goblin seem to shudder a bit, as though they're being rendered in half the frames per second as the surroundings. It doesn't ruin the gameplay, but it is a bit distracting. Styx: Shards of Darkness greatly resembles the earlier Styx: Master of Shadows from 2014, but Cyanide improved the gameplay this time around with the inclusion of craftable weapons, the lack of a lock-on in combat, and expanded abilities. It presents an interesting world to explore but wastes its potential by recycling environments from early missions late in the game. Co-op mode is fun, too, but only selectively as some stealth-only missions seem far more manageable on one's own."
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/ghost-recon-wildlands-review	 After 42 hours, 1,415 enemies, and 17,644 bullets, I have completed Ghost Recon: Wildlands’ campaign and hit the level cap. I also crashed some helicopters, which may or may not have led to the accidental deaths of my fellow IGN teammates. That’s classified. Wildlands’ map is, outside of MMOs, the largest I’ve seen in a game in a long time. If you played the beta (6.8 million of you did), you were restricted to only one province; the final game includes more than 20 provinces, some smaller, some larger, all packed with things to do. Each area includes at least one Santa Blanca Cartel boss, hidden weapons and attachments, enemies to interrogate, fast-travel locations, skill points and resources, commendation medals, bases to raid, and more. If you want a game that’ll keep you busy for a while, Wildlands absolutely has your back.    Biomes aren’t just eye candy; they have a major impact on how you play. No matter which part of the map you explore, Ubisoft’s in-game version of the South American country of Bolivia looks great. From the get-go, you’re free to roam the entire map, which includes jungles, mountains, deserts, salt flats, lakes, swamps, quarries, and caves. These biomes aren’t just eye candy; they have a major impact on how you play. Areas thick with foliage are perfect for hit-and-run guerrilla warfare. Deserts have little or no cover, so fighting from range works well and having an escape vehicle ready is imperative. In the mountains, with a bit of leg work, you can usually hike to the high ground and assault your enemies from above. Wildlands leaves the strategy up to you, and because vehicles and fast travel points are so plentiful, the wide-open Bolivian landscape feels like a land of opportunity, not a burden. Speaking of vehicles, yes, the chatter is true: many of them don’t control well. Even on a bone-dry dirt road, some cars and jeeps feel like they’re skidding around on slick ice. After 15 or so hours I was able to pilot anything without much trouble, but it took far too long to nail Wildlands’ “feel.” Choppers, in particular, take a while to break in: once you’re cruising, you’re good, but building up to that speed requires a weird dance of tipping the nose up and down and easing up on the throttle. And, because the map is so large, you’re forced to spend a ton of time in vehicles to get to locations between fast-travel points. Also, it’s very common for high-priority targets to jump into a vehicle and flee, and if they get too far away you’ll often lose them and fail. These situations take an already uneven driving and piloting system and push it to its frustrating breaking point. Wildlands’ main issue, however, is poor mission variety. For the first five or so provinces everything felt exciting. The next 15? Not so much. Until I switched to playing co-op, it descended deeper and deeper into repetition.   Flamethrower Guy, RPG Guy, and Guy With The Big Shield don’t make an appearance. The cycle begins with a boss hunt. Each province has a boss, and to learn that boss’ identity and draw him/her/them out from hiding you need to complete four to six missions. That’s not a major ask, but the missions are usually a rote combination of the following: blow up an inanimate object (cocaine cache, equipment), extract and interrogate a high-value target (an assistant, a family member), steal or photograph something (a car, documents), or just kill some stuff. It doesn’t help that enemy variety that stands between you and your objectives is almost non-existent. There are standard enemies, heavily-armored enemies, and snipers – that’s about it. Even common video game mainstays like The Flamethrower Guy, The RPG Guy, and The Guy With The Big Shield don’t make an appearance. Sometimes you’ll face other obstacles, like an enemy chopper or a jammer that keeps you from using your drone. They definitely crank up the intensity, but you’ll quickly learn how to deal with them, too. Even the variety that comes from the diverse locations isn’t enough to mix it up. These issues might have doomed Wildlands if not for its highly satisfying sandbox antics. When you’re a kid and you only have four action figures, what do you do with them? You fire up your imagination, go outside, and make your own ridiculous fun. The same goes for Wildlands. Yes, you may be on your umpteenth extraction mission... but this time, what if you throw your target in the trunk of a car instead of lifting him out by helicopter? That seems like a good idea, but before you can get into the driver’s seat an enemy truck rams that car down a hill. Now you’re running downhill to check on your VIP passenger, all while shouting at your friends to find a new escape vehicle. In the distance, you hear mortar fire. A second chopper is closing in.  Then, maybe next time you’re on an extraction mission enemies may take out your escape vehicle and you’ll have to run through the woods at night, holding your target by the neck and taking out pursuing enemies with only a pistol. Just when you think you’re home free, you’ll get spotted. The chase continues. Yes, the missions are too similar in design. You’ll undoubtedly feel the deja vu. But most of the time things don’t go the way you’d planned. The madness that ensues is what saves Wildlands, and what compelled me to keep playing well past the hours a human being should normally be awake. These are the moments I talk about when people ask me how I’m liking it. Some of those moments are made memorable by the boss characters. Wildlands’ standard enemies may not be special, but it does a fine job of turning cartel bosses into more than just targets. None of them will join the pantheon of great video game villains, but in games like this, it’s often the case for underlings to simply feel like rungs on a ladder, something you just step on in order to move up. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor got around this issue by imbuing its minibosses with personality, and so does Wildlands. These characters are outlandish, unnerving, and pulpy. Remember when Walt and Jesse dissolved bodies in barrels of acid in Breaking Bad? One of the cartel bosses does that too, but he also has a beloved stuffed animal and the mental capacity of a child. Another boss duo of former doctors plays weird sex games while they torture and interrogate the cartel’s enemies. It’s decidedly silly, and often more than a little bit on the nose, but they left a mark on me nonetheless.
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/just-dance-2017-review	 I’m sure I’m not alone in often feeling uncomfortable and awkward whenever I have to dance in public, but that doesn’t mean I don’t enjoy it. Just Dance 2017 creates a social atmosphere where every dancer takes queues from a screen, and the embarrassment from utter lack of coordination is usually laughed at as a group as you watch video replays of your collective mistimed moves. It takes a social convention, combines it with an effective cardio workout, and adds in popular, recognisable music for a party game that’s easy to pick up and play. As a series, Just Dance is nearly nine years old and has a well-established, predictable formula: you dance to a library of new songs with an impressive variety of choreography and unlock some simplistic emblems and icons as you go. It’s flashy from the menu to the color-saturated videos that let you know what dance moves to imitate, though, in the case of the Nintendo Switch, you technically only need to match with one hand because that’s all that’s actually tracked. I played mostly in docked mode with both Joy-Con detached, but it also works fine in tabletop mode, albeit with a smaller screen that’s harder to share with someone else.   The tracking doesn’t seem to mean a whole lot, though. Sometimes you’re told you mimicked a move “perfectly” and other times you can miss even though it feels like you’re doing the exact same thing. The difference isn’t clear, being that Just Dance 2017 doesn’t make effort to tell you what, specifically, you did incorrectly. I’d argue that correct Joy-Con holding form is the most important aspect. Given that it’s so imprecise, it’s a little weird that it assigns individual scores for you and the other three players you might be playing with or against. The most accurate way to play is on the Xbox One with Kinect, which tracks your entire body and allows for more players natively (you can have up to six players on Switch, too, but extras will have to join via mobile phone) by scanning the faces in the room, to the extent that even people who are sitting down are often scanned in and somehow manage to get points, too. The Kinect version does come with its own unique flaws, though: the menu is harder to control with motion, so it often ends with someone walking off to grab the Xbox controller at the end of each song. It’s a simple, tile-based menu that does manage to convey all of the information you might need about a song, but it’s still difficult to use with Kinect.  It probably won't make you a better dancer.  All of that said, it really is a game about dancing to songs you know, with Just Dance 2017 including some major recent hits like Major Lazer’s “Lean On” and Justin Bieber’s “Sorry.” If you suck at dancing, Just Dance probably won’t make you improve, but it is a lot of fun and the variety of different moves certainly lead to a good cardio workout. The professional dancers in their unique, colorful outfits are a delight to watch, too, and group dances particularly showcase creative, unpredictable, and fun choreography, including occasional some actual interaction between players, like high fives.  Unfortunately, a lot of songs are locked away behind Just Dance Unlimited, a paid subscription service that allows you to access songs from past games as well as some exclusive titles, for $39.99 a year. At this point, it feels like it might make more sense to have Just Dance exist as a digital-only game centered around Unlimited because the disc itself offers few updates from previous years. Just Dance 2017 is a very predictable update to a long-running series of dancing games that shines in visual design and unique choreography but is very loose with its tracking of your body movements. It’s not going to teach you to be a professional dancer, and it honestly doesn’t really teach you how to be good at Just Dance itself. That said, it’s still a whole lot of fun to play, and the songs that aren’t locked behind a paywall are varied and, largely, recognisable
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	" ""Reading,"" the Nigerian poet Ben Okri said once, ""is an act of civilization."" Torment: Tides of Numenera embraces this idea, pairing a whole fantasy novel’s worth of quality quest text with a design foundation that champions chatting with enemies rather than running them through with swords. It's a strange concept in the context of most roleplaying games, and Torment: Tides of Numenera delivers a satisfyingly strange world to complement it. It's too bad that the combat falls short when it's actually necessary, but the surrounding world usually presents enough memorable wonders to make up for it. As a spiritual successor to 1999's Planescape: Torment, one of the finest (and strangest) RPGs ever made, Torment: Tides of Numenera embraces its predecessor's isometric design with its use of the capable Pillars of Eternity engine. More importantly, it preserves Planescape: Torment's weird philosophical tone and aesthetic, filling the screen with everything from quasi-medieval markets to entire cities crafted out of meat.  Sometimes, admittedly, it clings too much to fantasy trappings despite its setting of a billion years in the future, and its mages and ax-wielding warriors leave it feeling like a take on Baldur's Gate with aliens in the place of elves. Fortunately, it's an attractive vision. It takes place in an era when the strange trash of thousands of dead civilizations – the titular numenera – rots scattered about the Earth, its purpose often long forgotten. It's a world where headless men arouse about as much curiosity as a 3D printer today, where neon-green monoliths zap the unprepared, and where pods packed with demigods sometimes plummet from the sky. For all that, it's also a world where random goons with swords attempt to rough you up if they don't like your looks. I guess some things never change.  I admire that you're not actually a hero, but effectively garbage – literally. Above all, though, it thrives on honoring Planescape's emphasis on a protagonist who's not on a quest to save the world. I admire that you're not actually a hero, but effectively garbage – literally. You’re the ""Last Castoff,"" the empty shell of a being called The Changing God who creates new bodies for himself and then dumps them like used Coke bottles once he's ready to move on to another. Others exist like you, and each assumes his or her own consciousness after being tossed aside. Through it all, a horrific entity known as The Sorrow mysteriously hunts down every castoff, and your main goal is never much more serious than keeping it at bay.  Fortunately, you're not such a nobody that no one wants to hang out with you. Torment: Tides of Numenera features several companions who can tag along with The Last Castoff three at a time, and I sometimes found their stories as fascinating as my character’s. Take the wise Callistege, who walks around surrounded by flickering clones of herself glimpsed from alternate realities. Or consider Erritis, a warrior whose unstable personality channels Beauty and the Beast's Gaston. Strangely, a disproportionately large amount of his lines are voiced, while the bulk of the rest of Torment's dialogue remains disappointingly relegated to text.  When you play Torment: Tides of Numenera, you might as well be reading a book. On that note, don't expect a bunch of pretty cutscenes to relay all this. Know that when you sit down to play Torment: Tides of Numenera, you might as well be reading a book. Aside from a quick tutorial, whole hours went by before I had to draw my sword. The voice acting, while excellent, shows up about as often as rain in the Sahara (unless, of course, you're around Erritis). It's tough to pull off this kind of text-heavy design – even Pillars of Eternity sometimes slips into drudgery because of it – but the quality of the writing here manages to sustain the story for nearly the entirety of its roughly 35 hours. (Completing all the many side quests would push this number far higher.) Unfortunately, it suffers a bit from one of the main drawbacks affecting the similar recent RPG Tyranny – when the end comes, it comes quickly, along with a multitude of revelations that leave the uncomfortable impression that additional content was condensed into a few conversation.  It still delivers a fantastic story, though, the power of which largely rests on the wealth and variety of its dialogue choices. Virtually every conversation and interaction triggers a cascade of dialogue options with skill checks, usually with text that sometimes sprawls into a dozen richly styled sentences. Tides allows for three combat classes – the warrior-like Glaive, the versatile Jack, and the mage-like Nano – and the latter opens even more dialogue options through the ability to read minds. In fact, conversations offer such a dizzying array of options that it's sometimes difficult to figure out how to end them (especially because the UI doesn’t gray out options you’ve already read through).  The red tide doesn't necessarily mean you're evil. Fortunately, carefully choosing each one isn't just about being rewarded with another burst of well-crafted text: much the fun of Tides consists of discovering how each option affects the influence of the titular tides over you. Persist in asking multiple questions and you'll gain points in the blue tide, which favors inquisitiveness. Do a good deed and you'll gain favor with the gold tide, which champions self-sacrifice. It's tempting to brand these as simple D&D-style alignments, but the twist is that Tides is written in such a way that your self-sacrifice could come with an ulterior motive. The red tide doesn't necessarily mean you're evil, it merely means that you act on your first impulses. Mixed together, they decide how other people react to you, which sometimes even carries over into combat. It's a decent foundation for replay, as you could either talk your way through almost everything or try to stick a sword in everyone who looks at you funny.   I usually found the combat comparatively dull. I can't say I found the thought of the latter particularly appealing. Not because I'm opposed to hacking up a few digital bad dudes with digital swords – far from it – but because I usually found the combat comparatively dull. The problem lies in the number of enemies it tosses at you. Tides of Numenera delights in piling several enemies on the Last Castoff and his or her buds at once, and they hit hard, making it uncommonly tough to survive even with the use of ciphers or taking advantage of an option to kill the leader and cause their followers to go running. Most of the time, though, it's just kind of tedious. The problems revealed themselves in an early ""crisis"" (Tides' fancy name for a battle), in which I had to sneak past a gaggle of humanoid insects while distracting them with musical objects. I only had one companion at the time, and there were maybe seven of the other guys. So every time I'd move, I'd have to wait for all of them to move as well, thus forcing the incident to go on far longer than it needed to. I didn't even try to fight them. That's probably a good thing. When I later finally had to jump into a real fight after a poorly chosen response, I realized I barely knew what to do with all the combat skills I'd amassed from leveling. Even when I was prepared, my little band of four would themselves surrounded with, say, seven cultists. More often than not, though, combat comes off as a distraction – so it’s a good thing you never really have to fight. At the same time, Tides’ battles include some interesting ideas. For instance, the influence of the tides carries over into combat, and sometimes on your turn you can use your influence to possibly persuade or intimidate a foe into ending a fight that's already started. Another strength is that each combat scenario feels carefully crafted rather than a random load of trash mobs thrown into a room, and there's a decent variety of combat skills depending on class – such as ""Warp Dash,"" which lets Jacks teleport to enemies and slash everyone in sight – and one-use ciphers, which unleash devastating attacks (and sometimes explode in your face if you're carrying too many at once). The animations aren't that special, but one thing it does well is allow for smart positioning in combat on both PC and console.  The battles disappoint overall, but that doesn't mean there's not some sense of strategy outside the squabbles peppered among the reams of dialogue boxes. One of Tides' better features in this regard is the ""effort"" system, which lets each character in the party draw from a pool of stat points every in-game day to add a little boost to the effectiveness of an action. Need to figure out how some eon-old gadget works? Pump a few effort points into the task and you'll have a greater chance to override it even if your class would fail the skill check in another RPG. It also works in combat, allowing you to land strikes that might have missed. Their limited design, much like the rest of Tides of Numenera, has the nice side effect of encouraging thoughtful play. Early on, it's hard to shake off the temptation of use effort points to their full effect at every opportunity, but I found greater reward in learning how to wait until I truly needed them. The turn-based combat may be a little disappointing, but Torment: Tides of Numenera manages to live up to the legacy of Planescape: Torment by offering a fascinatingly weird and well-written tale. Thanks to a wide variety of options in conversations and the influences of its tidal system, it offers decent opportunities for replay value and a memorable tale each time. This is the rare game that leans almost entirely on its setting and writing for its appeal, and the miraculous thing is that it usually succeeds."
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/halo-wars-2-review	 It is said that in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king. In that sense, Halo Wars 2 is the de facto king of real-time strategy games on consoles, where the venerable genre is underrepresented because of the challenges of managing a lot of units at once on a gamepad. Like its predecessor, Halo Wars 2 does a reasonably good job of overcoming many – not all – of those challenges, but compared to the best RTS games on PC, where it also exists, its campaign missions are flat and unambitious, and its distinctive Blitz multiplayer mode sacrifices the stability of a level playing field in the name of fast and unpredictable action. I admire Microsoft’s effort to expand its prized Halo series into something that spans beyond an endless procession of first-person shooters, and with Halo Wars 2 (like Halo Wars before it) we get to experience this sci-fi universe from a perspective that emphasizes the scope of its battles. Seeing instantly recognizable vehicles like Warthogs and Banshees on the field adds an inherited personality to what is otherwise a fairly standard set of units. While there are substantial differences in tactics thanks to the unique Banished (a rebel faction of the Covenant) units like suicide grunts and airborne Blisterback artillery, the greatest distinction between them and the UNSC Marines comes from support powers like bombardments and buffs cast from above.    Only a couple of mission designs think outside the box. The single-player campaign’s 12 missions took me roughly eight hours to complete, including restarting a couple of them a few times. The mission designs are nothing special – though they avoid the trap of repeating variations on the basic “go destroy the enemy base” cliche, they lean heavily on hero-focused objectives like leading your Spartans around the map and holdout missions against waves of enemies. There’s enough variety to keep them from feeling repetitive, but only a couple think outside the box of what StarCraft did almost 20 years ago, and the static base building on pre-determined plots doesn’t provide a lot of flexibility when it comes to build orders. Much of it is in the vein of the “campaign as multiplayer tutorial” model, teaching you which units counter what, how to deploy artillery units, and how to capture the majority of a map’s control points to win. Each one does come with a range of side objectives (such as keeping a specific unit alive, destroying extra bases within a time limit, or collecting resources from the map) to give them replayability on top of simply turning up the difficulty, though. Between those missions are some exceptionally well animated cutscenes that tell the story of the UNSC starship Spirit of Fire. The latest Cortana stand-in, Isabel, is a surprisingly endearing character who emotes much more effectively than her human friends. Captain Carter and the three interchangeable Spartans under his command might as well be cardboard cutouts for all the personality they exhibit, but they have a great threat to fight against thanks to the new brute villain, Atriox. He fades into the background after a spectacularly intimidating introduction, but his presence is still felt through Isabel’s fear of him.   Where Halo Wars 2 feels most limited is in its controls. That’s not at all surprising for the gamepad, where controls for an RTS are always going to be clumsy at best, and though I didn’t expect this problem to be fully solved, developer Creative Assembly doesn’t seem to have done a lot to design its battles to avoid it, either. For example, the speed with which units tend to die in combat isn’t very forgiving when you consider how slowly most people are likely to be able to react. It’s definitely workable, using a very similar layout to what the first Halo Wars has, with some clever changes like using a double-tap of the right bumper to select all units. But even things like that can’t make up for the shortage of buttons and precision on the controller relative to a mouse and keyboard.  Gamepad controls work, but usually not quickly enough. If, for instance, you’re trying to get your Warthogs and Scorpion tanks out of range of the anti-vehicle gun of a Hunter before they can inflict real damage and move up your anti-infantry Hellbringer flamethrower units to counter, it’s tricky to pull off in the heat of battle. You have to select all units on screen using the right bumper, then use the right trigger to cycle through the available unit types – which can be a lot in a large army – and then you can move that unit type independently. It works, but usually not quickly enough, especially if you have multiple vehicle types to move to safety. Then it might be faster to target and double-tap a unit with the A button to select all of that type, then hold right-trigger and double-tap one of the other types to select both at once. Good luck with that if you’re working with air units.   That said, it’s impressive that Creative Assembly was able to pack all the controls you need, with the ability to assign up to four control groups to the D-pad and even queue up move commands, onto a gamepad. The catch is that much of that is accessed by holding the right trigger to change the functions of the rest of the buttons, which means you basically need to learn twice as many controls as you do for most games. Again, it’s not insurmountable or unusable, but it’s no picnic. I’m sure some people out there will get good enough with these controls to be relatively fast and become competitive with them (someone has, after all, beaten Dark Souls with a Guitar Hero controller) but by and large I expect most people will get through the campaign and many multiplayer matches largely by selecting all units on screen and throwing them into battle to fend for themselves. That’s where the support powers come in and compensate for the lack of micromanagement dexterity. Some of these are strikingly powerful when fully upgraded, such as the Archer missiles that destroy a swath of enemies and the extremely useful ODST soldier drops, and using them at the right moment feels great and can absolutely turn the tide of a battle.  Strange issues make it feel unpolished next to its PC RTS peers. Controls are better on the PC version (this is a Microsoft Play Anywhere game, meaning that if you buy one version digitally you get the other for free) but there are some strange issues that make it feel unpolished and disappointing next to its PC RTS peers. Clicking the minimap frequently messes up and simply doesn’t work, forcing you to use the WASD keys to scroll for navigation. Likewise, the command for a unit to use its special ability seems to only work every few attempts. Bizarrely, in the Blitz mode multiplayer there are no default keybindings for recalling a control group you’ve set, rendering it effectively broken until you go into the clumsy menus and manually fix it by rebinding them. And you can’t bind the mouse scroll wheel to the camera zoom, because that control is permanently locked to cycling through unit types in your selection (which is something you barely need to do on PC). I still prefer to play on mouse and keyboard, but this experience should be better.    Frequent bugs are something I didn’t expect from a Halo game. Speaking of things that should be better, back on the Xbox One side I saw frequent bugs in the campaign missions, which is something I didn’t expect from a Halo game. I’ve had crashes, infinite loading screens, five- to 10-second freezes, stuck units, mission events failing to trigger (forcing me to replay the mission) and more. I got through it, but I was surprised to see such technical roughness. Fortunately, the glitches have been almost entirely limited to the campaign thus far, with the exception of the stuck units bug, which has popped up in multiplayer on both Xbox and PC. Most of Halo Wars 2’s long-term appeal is in those multiplayer modes, which are to its credit significantly more diverse and in some ways interesting than you typically see in an RTS. On top of the standard deathmatch mode there’s the territory-control Domination style (reminiscent of Relic’s Company of Heroes and Dawn of War 2 multiplayer) which really gives the support powers a lot of moments to shine. Spotting a bunch of enemy units camped on top of a control point is an excellent time to use a bombardment ability, for example. And because you’re given the choice of seven commander characters with different sets of support abilities, you have lots of options there - including some who can temporarily cloak groups of units or create holographic diversions. But again, the base building options feel limited by the predescribed locations, which constrains build order freedom. That means the variety is going to be down to which of the handful of maps you’re playing on.   Similarly, there’s a different territory-control mode called Stronghold where you’re competing to control the most base-building locations on the map when the timer ends; the twist is that everyone has completely unlimited resources. That makes it all about unit tactics, which, if you’re playing on Xbox, is not Halo Wars 2’s strongest point. But it does create some pitched battles where you don’t have to care about such pithy things as resource production or upgrades. I’d call it a fun diversion - like playing a goofy cheat mode.  You can win or lose Blitz based on luck. In its own section of the menu, separate from the conventional multiplayer modes, is Blitz – a faster, more frantic mode where instead of building bases to produce resources and more troops, you summon soldiers using a deck of cards you’ve prepared ahead of time. I generally like this kind of randomization in single-player games because it prevents you from falling into patterns and repeating the same successful tactics over and over again, because you might not have access to the card you’d want to use at the moment you want to use it. Improvisation feels good. Alas, I don’t think it’s a great fit for a competitive multiplayer game because all too often you win or lose based on a combination of your own luck and the enemy’s, rather than the test of skill on the asymmetrical but level playing field I expect from an RTS. Blitz is fun, but I think that dependence on luck is going to shorten its long-term appeal. And when that luck extends to giving you random new cards, some of which are unique to the six leaders, in upgrade packs that are also for sale in the store, I worry even more. You can’t directly buy the power you want, but you can buy another shot at it. Hopefully the matchmaking system is smart enough not to pair people with crazy-powerful cards in their decks against those with more modest decks, but that remains to be seen.   Finally, there’s a single-player and co-op variant of Blitz called Firefight that’s about holding out against ever-increasing waves of enemies as they try to overwhelm you and capture two of three points on the map. I’m having some good fun in there, where the randomness is about creating unexpected scenarios without the shame of losing to another human you think you should’ve beaten, and the balance is tweaked so that swarms of enemy units explode easily under my Banished lasers. That’s a very good use for the card mechanic. Halo Wars 2 will scratch a real-time strategy itch and give you a dose of Halo-Universe flavor with a decent story, but it won’t go much deeper than that. A run-of-the-mill campaign, controls that hamper micromanagement, conspicuous bugs, and multiplayer that relies on luck limit its long-term appeal, but its fast and flashy action makes it fun for a while.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	 For Honor’s combat is the kind of brutal melee I always wanted, but never thought I’d actually get to play. Its third-person action-game exterior hides a strategically complex fighting game, mixing team-based action with less interesting solo modes, all built on the most flexible and technically complete melee fighting system I’ve ever experienced. For Honor lives and dies on its fighting system, dubbed “The Art of Battle” by Ubisoft, and it’s the reason For Honor is more like a traditional fighting game in the vein of Street Fighter or Soul Calibur than the hack-and-slash Dynasty Warriors it appears to be at first glance. Locking onto an opponent puts you into “duel mode,” for lack of a better term, where you can change your guard to block left, right, or top. You can block incoming attacks from the direction you’re guarding, and you have to read which direction your opponent is guarding and attack from one of the two directions from which they’re vulnerable to successfully hit.  Sounds simple enough, right? Well, it isn’t. Under the surface of that premise runs a deep and complex web of dodges, parries, guardbreaks, counters, light and heavy attacks, combo chains, feints, recoveries, unblockable attacks, uninterruptable attacks, stuns, throws, environmental kills, and of course, grisly executions. If a fight ends without a head rolling around on the ground, it’s a surprise.  If a fight ends without a head rolling around on the ground, it’s a surprise. Putting all of those moves to good use are the 12 heroes spread evenly across the three factions of Knights, Vikings, and Samurai. Each faction has a Vanguard (all-purpose hero), a Heavy (slow but packs a punch), an Assassin (fast and deadly but fragile), and a Hybrid (long-ranged weapons with lots of utility). Though I prefer the heavier heroes, such as the Knights’ Conqueror and Lawbringer and the Vikings’ Warlord, having at least a baseline understanding of each hero is mandatory if you want to be able to predict how they’re going to try to hack you to pieces. For example, For Honor’s assassins all follow the same principles: stay mobile, strike fast, don’t get hit much. But each one of them plays incredibly differently: the Knights’ Peacekeeper applies damage over time bleeds and retreats, the Berserker swipes hard with twin axes in a flurry, and the Orochi has devastating dodge counters and guaranteed followups.  And that type of variety is the same for each of the hero classes, so even if you don’t like a particular hero of a class, odds are there’s another one of the same type that might work for you. More importantly – and I realize it’s early on to say this – almost all heroes feel balanced. Of course there are some that are more viable than others in highly competitive play, but for the majority of players, you can find success with any hero that does it for you. Fortunately, For Honor comes with a suite of options and modes to get you up to speed in each class relatively quickly. There are basic tutorials, advanced tutorials, and an AI punishment sponge to practice against with variable difficulties. Best of all, every game mode in For Honor is playable against AI, so you can get a grasp of how each mode works without being subjected to players who’ve already put in the time and are just waiting for fresh meat to humiliate.   There’s nothing in For Honor that can’t be earned by grinding. The economy may be frugal, but at least it’s honest. For Honor’s multiplayer isn’t a game to dip in and out of. Progressing your version of a Knight or Samurai into the awesomely armor-clad warriors of your dreams takes an equal amount of patience because the in-game currency, Steel, is rewarded sparsely for each match completed. For example, completing a Duel match against an AI opponent nets you approximately 10-20 Steel. For a Basic Scavenger pack (containing a few pieces of standard gear), you’re going to need to spend 300 Steel. That’s not unreasonable, but some of the more extravagant outfits and ornaments can go for as much as 15,000 Steel. That seems so daunting when you’re earning a few hundred per match at best that it might as well be 15 million, and feels designed to push you toward the store where Steel can be bought for dollars. But this recession-style lack of currency is offset by daily and weekly contracts that can be taken and completed in multiplayer matches for bonus experience and currency. Still, I freely admit to buying a Steel pack as a shortcut for some sweet fiery wings on my Lawbringer, but at least there’s nothing in For Honor that can’t be bought by just spending time grinding. The economy may be frugal, but at least it’s honest.   For Honor’s excellent combat intricacy is on full display in the one-versus-one Duel and two-versus-two Brawl modes, and these are my favorite ways to experience what it does so well. There’s a very real sense of accomplishment to be had when you square off another player, and your skill in battle is the only determining factor of pulling out a victory. Brawl mode is a similar experience, though like in any team sport you can often be at the mercy of your partner’s skills. (It’s crushing to be winning a fight, only to be jumped by your partner’s opponent after they’ve been killed.) Yet the combat system provides the necessary tools to effectively fight off a second enemy while you’re concentrating on another, and pulling out a victory two-versus-one fight is up there with the most validating feelings to be had.  Unfortunately some of the nuance gets lost when you crank it up to the larger, four-versus-four Dominion, Elimination, and Skirmish modes, where two teams battle it out over control points or just murder each other. Here, the delicate balance of the combat often gives way to messy brawls, and when one team loses a player, they’re hard-pressed to stop a snowball of multiple enemies beating on them.  When one team loses a player, they’re hard-pressed to stop a snowball of multiple enemies beating on them. To counter this, For Honor includes an equalizer called Revenge mode - a meter that slowly fills when you’re on the defensive - that, when activated, grants you a temporary attack and defense buff along with a shield to soak up the damage. It’s a great tool to help turn the tide, and it regularly swings a fight in your favor, at least for a time. But the team with the greater numbers almost always wins, which can be frustrating when facing against well-organized teams with communication in a public lobby. However, with equally skilled teams, the eight-person modes are exceptionally flexible and varied. For example, in Dominion Mode, in which you’re fighting to capture and hold the control zones, avoiding battle entirely is a viable strategy. That lets you push your team to the 1,000-point milestone where the enemy team stops respawning and you can pick them off.  These modes have a more arcade feel to them than straight duels because of the unlockable skills, called feats. Those augment heroes or give them abilities like dropping a flaming catapult projectile on contested areas, killing everyone, and that means strategy and tactics can really shine through over the pure skill-based melees, and add another layer on top of the baseline combat.  My experience with the peer-to-peer connections in a fight has been mostly fair and even. And deep down underneath all this is For Honor’s usually consistent netcode. There are moments where I feel like I’m on the receiving of some laggy inputs, but my general experience with the peer-to-peer connections in a fight has been fair and even. The most noticeable symptom of players hosting matches is you’re in for a few seconds of loading time when the host drops, which can ruin a good fight and potentially an entire match if the AI that replaces the missing player doesn’t hold up. The biggest issue I have is continually joining into games already in progress, or basically over. It’s mitigated by the way you get to stay in the lobby with your new group after the fact, but it’s annoying to lose a round for no reason. I’ve stopped caring about my win/loss percentage in group modes because of this.   For Honor’s single-player campaign is, pardon the pun, a double-edged sword. Divided across three chapters (one for each faction) and six missions each, its brisk five- to eight-hour run time feels just long enough to be satisfying without overstaying its welcome.  Scattered throughout each of the 18 missions are some great scripted moments. The gameplay strings together the same lock-on and fight experience of multiplayer, but against noticeably simpler AI for the majority of the campaign. The exception to this are the boss fights, which are genuinely fun and regularly challenging. But scattered throughout each of the 18 missions are some great scripted moments, giving you the opportunity to mix things up and do something other than stab people. You’ll siege a fortress while archers rain down fire from above, scaling its walls with grappling hooks and ropes. You’ll encounter a hostile elephant, pursue an enemy on horseback, annihilate clumps of enemies with a ballista, and lay waste to small armies with your hero abilities. These moments are For Honor’s campaign is at its best. Unfortunately the plot is thin and the characters are almost all forgettable. And honestly, that’s fine – a historical-fiction premise as ridiculous as these three factions locked in centuries of warfare doesn’t really need great dialogue to make it enjoyable.  I did enjoy that the campaign forces you to play almost all the heroes, which acts as a good primer to learning them properly. And while I can’t see myself going back for a second helping of the campaign in the future, there are varying difficulty levels (including a Realistic mode that removes the guard indicator) if you’re looking for a reason to go back. You can also hunt for hidden collectibles in every mission, but they’re often frustrating to search out. Of the two kinds, the breakable jars are simple and give you a small amount of steel for each one found. The other are “points of interest”-style landmarks that don’t really become visible until you get close to them. I spent more time than I wanted to running to the far corners and crevices of each level and spinning my camera in all directions just to make sure I didn’t miss one. For Honor has some dents in its shiny armor, such as the mediocre campaign, the frugal economy, and the snowballing victories in team modes. But it’s hard to be mad too long when I consider that the melee combat system is second to none and a joy to learn, take your licks, and then learn some more. I could feel myself becoming a better warrior with this deep, flexible, and complete fighting system. The more I play For Honor, the more I want to play For Honor. I hope Ubisoft doubles-down on support, because it’s something truly special.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	" You know those elaborate machines built to make simple tasks more complicated, like striking a match or springing a mousetrap? They’re called Rube Goldberg machines, and they now have a shooter equivalent in Sniper Elite 4. Rebellion’s stealth shooter shares the weaknesses and strengths of these contraptions. It’s long and complex, and taking your time to use all your gadgets can feel silly when blasting away at baddies often works fine. Just pick up the darn match and strike it yourself, right? However, Sniper Elite 4 doesn’t only give you the tools to kill Nazis in its (mostly) realistic World War II setting; it gives you the means to stalk them, scare them, and utterly dismantle them if you have the patience. Setting up traps doesn’t feel crucial outside of higher difficulty modes, but playing puppet master is always intuitive and rewarding. It’s by far the thing Sniper Elite 4 is best at. I found myself putting in the effort not because I had to, but because I wanted to.   If you’re going to put “Sniper” in the title of a game, you’d better put serious thought into your weapon mechanics. True to its name, Sniper Elite delivers options galore, but its single-player and co-op campaign wisely doesn’t force you to consider all of them all the time.   Before you pull the trigger, here’s a handful of things you might think about: Will you use regular ammo or more precious silenced ammo? Can you score the kill quickly, or will you need to hold your in-game breath to steady your aim? Have you considered the effect gravity will have on your bullet? Is your weapon’s muzzle velocity high enough to hit a moving target with only a small lead, or will you need to aim a few feet further in front of your target to land that heart shot?  Few shooters pack so much consequence into each copper casing.  And that’s just for the standard difficulty. If you crank up it up to “Authentic” mode, you’ll also have to contend with wind speed and direction, weapon spread, more scope drift, ammo scarcity, realistic magazines (losing the bullets you didn’t fire from a clip when you reload early), and more. All of these factors matter, and they make each long-range shot into a miniature math problem. It sounds like it could be cumbersome or tedious, but the satisfaction of learning the systems and, eventually, intuitively “feeling” the bullets makes it gratifying to experiment, fail, and improve. Few shooters pack so much consequence into each copper casing. There is a side-effect to Sniper’s smorgasbord of options, though. The difference between difficulty modes is astounding, and that corresponds heavily with the level of effort you’ll need to put into your play. As I mentioned at the beginning, Sniper Elite 4 often asks more from you than it actually requires. On normal mode, if you miss a shot and blow your cover you can gun down foes with a pistol or an SMG and you’ll probably be fine. On hard, escaping this scenario becomes much more painful because sniping is harder and enemies are tougher, and on Authentic, every tiny bit of caution is warranted because your HUD is limited. So, unless you’re bent on playing like a masochist, a healthy chunk of Sniper Elite 4’s ideas fall into the “take it or leave it” category.   Sniper Elite’s humdrum World War II story is spread across eight huge campaign levels. I didn’t finish a single one in under an hour, and many took closer to two. This is far longer than most shooter missions, but because you make your own path and do only what you want to do, they didn’t drag at all.   Every mission begins with a few primary objectives – Nazis to kill, generally – and a smattering of secondary tasks, such as destroying a downed spy plane or blowing up an ammo cache. Your map is marked with large, non-specific circles to point you toward your goals, and… that’s that. Sniper Elite 4 lets you put on your grown-up pants (fatigues?) and solve these problems however you see fit. I spent most of my early time in each mission crouched in foliage, tagging enemies, vehicles, ammunition, explosives, and more with my binoculars. Once spotted, you can see their icons at all times and move through the battlefield with more confidence. It may not sound like much, but hunting for every single mark is step one in your upcoming reign of terror; when your plan inevitably goes to hell, your preparatory efforts will keep you alive. Having so much control over your fate turns what should be a menial task into something fun and worthwhile.  ...When your plan inevitably goes to hell, your preparatory efforts will keep you alive.  Repetition fatigue is also countered by the fact that Sniper Elite 4 packs tons of variety into its eight levels, both visually and functionally. Your European tour takes you to a remote island, a radar facility, a fortified mansion, and a viaduct in the woods (among others). In a game where you spend lots of time staring at the environment and waiting for someone to do something foolish, such as moving, it’s great to always have a refreshing new location to scope out. More importantly, most levels have a mechanic or a geographical feature that differentiates them from the others. For example, one map has a massive railgun that periodically fires off into the distance, and if you synchronize your shots with its blasts you can mask your rifle’s sounds and stay hidden, like real snipers are known to do in thunderstorms. Another map has heavily armed gunboats patrolling its edges, making the typically safe outskirts a riskier route. These modifiers complement the already varied gameplay in a way that keeps you alert and improvising.   In Sniper Elite 4, you don’t have to just take out enemies with wanton aggression. You have the tools to go full Dark Knight on these guys. Once you’ve played enough Sniper Elite to understand its options you can set up kills like dominoes with incredibly satisfying results. For example, a quick, favorite technique of mine: after killing a Nazi officer I planted a grenade on his body that would explode when jostled. Once a guard on patrol came near I tossed a rock to make a sound that would draw his attention and lure him close to the body. When he checked the body, it exploded and drew over a handful of other enemies. They all rushed over to check on the commotion, but they didn’t consider the fuel tanks right behind them. The placement of the body hadn’t been random.   That’s just one example of the dozens upon dozens I concocted. In addition to good old rocks, you have a whistle, trip mines, TNT, regular and adhesive grenades, and more. Once you’ve gotten a lay of the land with your binoculars, you can set up traps and purposely blow your cover, letting enemies funnel toward your explosives. If diversion is more your style, you can plant TNT on a truck, snipe it from afar with silenced ammo, and go about your business in a newly vacant area as everyone rushes away to investigate.  Sniper Elite 4’s levels, combined with your gadgetry, make on-the-fly deathtraps a pleasant possibility. Constantly outsmarting the enemy AI in new and, interesting ways keeps even the longest levels from growing stale.  Most engagements become much more than whatever you originally planned them to be...  It’s an odd thing to say, but after only a level or two, I began to see Sniper’s maps as a giant spider web. Motion on one side will register far and wide, for better and for worse. Most engagements become much more than whatever you originally planned them to be, and scrapping old plans to deal with new problems is tense, exciting, and a good test of your skills – even more so in later levels when tanks and airstrikes come into play. It’s a shame not as much variety was extended to your weapons themselves, but they’re sadly limited by history. Several rifles, SMGs, and sidearms are available as part your starting loadout or on the bodies of fallen enemies, but the differences between them are generally so slight that swapping doesn’t feel necessary or meaningful outside of higher difficulties when one type of ammo is running low but another type is plentiful. I used the same rifle for almost the entire campaign, and I never felt the need to change it up.   Sniper Elite 4 has a handful of ways to play alongside a friend – and if you have a chance to play it with a buddy, I highly recommend doing so. Playing the campaign missions as a pair is much like playing alone in that you can do whatever you want. If you both want to go guns blazing, go for it. You have twice the firepower! But splitting up is a much more interesting and entertaining option, especially when playing with friendly fire enabled. If you’re both together, you’ll probably make more noise and draw more attention. If you’re split up, you can take turns causing a ruckus, forcing the map’s enemies and vehicles to ping-pong back and forth between you the two of you. Sure, the risk of getting hurt and bleeding out is higher, but that’s a chance you can take. That said, there’s no blueprint for how to “best” play co-op. So many things are possible within the mechanics available that two brains can dive in, dig around, and have a great time. The hands-off approach doesn’t feel lazy; it feels respectful, like a challenge to try something new.  My favorite use of co-op in Sniper Elite 4 is Survival, which is a variant of Gears of War’s Horde mode. Played with up to four, enemies come at you in 12 waves, each more difficult than the last. The action is faster and more focused than the campaign, but it focuses the experience without giving up the great experimental nature of this wide-open toybox. Another great thing about Survival is the way your footing changes as the rounds go on. On each map you have a supply station that constantly gives you ammo, mines, and other supplies, but you have to protect it; if the enemies invade your base for long enough, they’ll deactivate it for several rounds. Until this happens, Survival feels like a game of fortification that encourages you to hunker down and hold out. Once you’re overrun, it changes things so drastically that it can feel as if you’re playing a different mode. Without the supply station you’re much more reliant on scrounging ammo and gear from enemies’ bodies, turning it into a game of guerrilla warfare. You run, take shots when you can, and run again before an airstrike blows you to bits. Getting to a high wave number is no small feat, and the one-life-only nature of the mode (there are no revivals in war) makes for bold rescues, necessary sacrifices, and lots of tension all around. It’s a wonderful take on what easily could have been yet another Horde copy-and-paste job.   Sniper Elite 4's multiplayer feels more ""hit or miss"" than its other modes. Taking out targets feels the best when you have ample time to scout, plan, and prepare. This works best against enemies that are unaware they're being hunted, and competitive multiplayer is obviously not the same scenario. There are a few game types that stand out, the best one being a mode that requires you to kill from range to win. At the end, whoever has the highest total kill distance wins, meaning patience and long-range shots are what really count. In this mode, most players find a decent spot, go prone, and search for a target. It sounds like this could grow stale quickly, but there's a thrill to knowing that, at any second, your slightest movement could tip you off to an enemy sniper. Likewise, when you catch someone moving in some foliage and you line up a perfect headshot from across the map, there's nothing like it.  Control mode is essentially just a capture and hold the point mode, but it does a great job at facilitating different styles of play. On one hand, when everyone is funneling into one area, the obvious decision is to sit back and pick off enemies with ease. However, you won't be able to capture the point for yourself, so you'll need to coordinate with teammates who will rush in and do the dirty work. It keeps the action fast, focused, and tense, without favoring one play style too heavily over another. A lot of games tout the ability to “play how you want to play,” but Sniper Elite 4’s missions and mechanics actually are robust enough to back up that claim. Picking apart the Nazi war machine piece by piece, using whatever plan comes to mind, is a blast. The way it encourages you to stay mindful, experiment, and get better is a refreshing vote of confidence, even if it doesn’t always reward the extra effort you’re putting in."
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	 Resident Evil 7 takes some big risks with the long-running horror series. But even as some succeed and others fall flat, this new first-person take on the formula wisely remembers that it’s survival-horror adventure — composed of tense exploration and careful item-hunting — and not solely its action that made its early predecessors memorable. With one of the creepiest single settings since the Spencer Mansion and an enticingly bizarre mystery to unravel, this is the most fun I’ve had with a Resident Evil game in years.  The atmosphere in Resident Evil 7 is the strongest the series has seen in a long time, and that’s owed entirely to the eerie Dulvey plantation, to which the player character Ethan has been summoned by a cryptic email from his missing wife. If classic Resident Evil games were rooted in the zombie films of George A. Romero, this is Resident Evil in the tradition of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, with all the gruesome imagery, dilapidated old shacks, and cannibalistic horrors that come with it.  Resident Evil 7’s change in style and setting never fails to deliver a strong sense of place. Sometimes that makes for an interesting backdrop, especially as you begin to trace the residents of the Dulvey Mansion’s descent into savagery and uncover the way it’s manifested in their domestic life. Traces of humanity aren’t hard to find behind all the locked doors: old photographs, trophies for academic achievement, a discarded football helmet. Compared to the cold, medieval interior of the still-beloved Spencer Mansion, the Baker household actually feels like a lived-in space rather than a grandiose maze of traps and hidden laboratories, which is an interesting and more intimate change of scenery that focuses on something that the series has never fully explored before.  Other times, Resident Evil 7’s roots in “hillbilly horror” relies too heavily on overplayed tropes about rural America and begins to border on the cartoonish. The Bakers are disgusting, dysfunctional, and at times pretty laughable, but most of this is at least explained later on, which — without spoilers — satisfactorily avoids putting the blame entirely on their rural upbringing. But even with its faults, Resident Evil 7’s change in style and setting never fails to deliver a strong sense of place that makes frequent exploration and backtracking through the dingy Dulvey property and its secret underground lairs work without wearing out its welcome.  Puzzles are disappointingly rare and far too simple. The setting’s only real failing is its puzzles, which were disappointingly rare and far too simple. Rather than hiding codes and passwords behind riddles or forcing some kind of threat or fail state on me if I entered in an incorrect solution as previous games have (think of the Armor Room puzzle from the first Resident Evil), Resident Evil 7 doesn’t even seem to try to make its obstructions interesting or challenging. I felt like I simply stumbled upon answers more than I did employed any kind of real problem-solving to get there.  On more than one occasion, the solution to a problem was handed to me before I really felt like I was given the chance to start investigating it. In one area that required me to open up a wall panel that housed a secret room, a child’s drawing just a foot or two away from the wall panel in question circled exactly where I needed to look to find it. A more subtle approach that let me investigate the room of my own accord would have greatly improved scenarios like this one, especially because the first-person perspective lets you take a more detailed look at your surroundings than the traditional third-person view of other Resident Evil games does.   The Baker family, like unstoppable tyrants with unpleasant personalities, are among the first enemies you’ll encounter, and they’re by far the most interesting. The first fight with Jack Baker had me both laughing hysterically and scrambling frantically for a way to defend myself, a winning combination that made the unpredictable encounter one of Resident Evil 7’s highlights. Jack’s patrolling of the mansion — at one point even bursting through a wall, Mr. X-style — actually felt like a real threat, even after I was armed with more than a knife. To survive, I needed to either flee or fend him off by unloading my handgun on him, which is a decision that can come back to haunt you.  Resident Evil 7 has no hiding or heavily stealth-focused gameplay, contrary to what its first-person horror style might lead some to believe. It’s still a Resident Evil game, and you still need to shoot enemies to kill them or else they’ll continue to roam around where you left them, waiting to kill you the next time you backtrack on by. Only this time, you can’t rely on the safety of load screen doors to keep baddies out, which only ups the tension when low health or low ammo means you do need to just make an escape. Better get really good at closing doors behind you, because not even safe rooms are safe anymore.  A wider variety of new enemies and situations to face them in would have made it a lot scarier. But while the Bakers are the best enemies, there’s an extremely wide gap in quality between them and the only other prominent enemy type in Resident Evil 7. Throughout my roughly 10-hour journey, just about the only other enemy type I encountered were hulking, oil-black creatures called The Molded. They come in a few varieties: the standard Molded; the ones with a giant, warped arm reminiscent of classic tyrant designs; ones that crawl around; and heavyset ones that vomit acid. (There are also bugs in one area, but they serve more as obstacles to overcome than hostiles with distinct behaviors.) While visually repulsive and threatening enough to cause more than a couple of tense combat encounters, The Molded lost their ability to shock me very quickly — especially because the scenarios in which you encounter them are all so similar.   I was glad to see micromanagement make a comeback. When I think of my favorite Resident Evil moments from past games, two come to mind: the first time Hunters appear in the original and 2002 remake of Resident Evil, and the first time you encounter a Crimson Head in the wild. What made these moments good was their unpredictability – you had no idea what you were about to face after that first-person sequence marking the Hunters’ arrival, and seeing a dead zombie you’ve passed by a dozen times already suddenly leap to life — and then a second time, even stronger — was something horrifyingly new. Resident Evil 7 could have used more moments like this, but it does far too much signaling ahead of everything it does. The Molded tear themselves out of the wall with a distinctly slimy sound, and they only do so in areas overtaken by mounds of black mold. So even when there are opportunities for them to at least deliver a jump scare, you’ll be anticipating it at the first sight of a molded wall. (Though there is one moment where one of the crawlers burst through a wall in an area that I had already passed by a few times, so… props to that guy.)  Most of Resident Evil 7’s tension comes from finding yourself in tough situations and struggling to adapt, since it’s all about scavenging for items and conserving what little ammunition and resources you do have. (In other words, classic Resident Evil style.) With limited inventory space and a familiar reliance on item boxes to manage your belongings, I found that constantly storing small amounts of handgun and shotgun ammo as I found it, granting myself a safety net of health-restoring green herbs, and keeping psychostimulants handy for tracking down well-hidden items was a welcome layer of micromanagement on top of every larger objective. I’m happy to see that core Resident Evil idea make a comeback in 7. But being forced to change up my survival tactics in the face of new, unpredictable enemies and situations throughout the campaign would have made the experience a lot scarier.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	 Those of you who’ve played Forza Horizon 3 might remember spotting a snow-covered peak thrusting up into the sky, deep in the distant background. You couldn’t drive there; it was merely a decorative tease. Well, it isn’t anymore. Forza Horizon 3’s first paid expansion, Blizzard Mountain, has arrived, and has brought with it a driving experience like never before seen in the series. And it’s very, very good.  The differences between Blizzard Mountain and Forza Horizon 2’s equivalent Storm Island expansion are immediate. Storm Island features wilder and windier weather than the standard inclement conditions in Forza Horizon 2 but the environment itself is largely similar to the main game. It’s really more of the same, with the rain going sideways. Blizzard Mountain, by contrast, is not more of the same. Or, at least, not in terms of the environment. Blizzard Mountain is, if you’ll excuse the pun, the polar opposite to Forza Horizon 3’s existing sun-scorched desert, pristine beaches, and dense bush. It’s icy roads, treacherous drops, powder-filled paddocks, and huge elevation changes. Visually it’s amongst developer Playground Games’ best work yet, which is some achievement considering much of the landscape’s nuance is largely hidden under a thick blanket of plain white. Gum trees are dusted in snowflakes and strips of asphalt glint beneath slush-filled wheel ruts. During clear, sunny days the light beams authentically off the snow. It’s similar in some ways to the stark brightness of Forza Horizon 3’s outback area but it trades the desert’s oppressive, orange-tinted heat for a noticeably cooler feel thanks to the terrific global-illumination system. That snow simple pickup truck. The new weather effects (blizzards, because it’s not just a clever name) are astounding; trees rock violently, show swirls, and visibility is reduced to a few car lengths. At night, the effect is amplified. It’s a stunning spectacle to drive through, if a little nerve wracking in Horizon 3’s faster cars.  There really isn’t any area in which Playground has skimped on detail. Your car’s bodywork will be convincingly caked in snow as you drive around, and tyres collect snow in their tread. There’s a nice new effect for snowflakes hitting windscreens, distinct from the excellent rain effects from the main game. You’ll even find your driver is now sporting a suitably festive woolly jumper. There really isn’t any area in which Playground has skimped on detail. It’s definitely a shame the Blizzard Mountain world itself is a standalone environment rather than more elegantly weaved into the existing world (it would’ve been nice to see how the team would’ve blended it in, like The Crew’s world) but it’s not a gripe I’ve dwelled on much. The introduction of snow into the world of Forza Horizon 3 is much more than a cosmetic shift, too, because the driving dynamics are radically changed here in Blizzard Mountain. There’s deep snow to contend with off-road and some cars have a better time clawing through it than others; building momentum in it can be tricky. There’s a large frozen lake where grip is reduced massively and you suddenly need to begin thinking of your next move twice as early as you may be used to. There are even hazardous sections of glaze ice on many of the mountain’s courses (usually cunningly placed in braking zones or apexes) which have a similarly devastating effect on handling as Forza Motorsport 6’s standing puddles. Avoid them, because once you drop a wheel onto that ice you’re a passenger. License to thrill. Blizzard Mountain isn’t entirely unlike Storm Island; like its forebear it operates as a smaller, self-contained version of the main game. There are 50 roads to discover, as opposed to 488 on the Forza Horizon 3 map, but it’s smattered with a familiar assortment of race types and activities like drift zones, speed traps, danger signs, and a handful of new Bucket List challenges. What Playground has done here, however, is shake up the progression system. Basically, it demands slightly more of us than the main game does. Rather than amassing fans on Blizzard Mountain we need to unlock stars, which are awarded for various levels of success in events. For instance, simply completing a race will net you a single star, and winning a race will score you two. To get all three stars, however, you’ll need to win and fulfil a separate objective in the process, like amassing a certain number of skill points or some such. It means the outcome of a race matters more in Blizzard Mountain than it does in the main game, and higher stakes are (almost) always a good thing. The hurdle here is that I’ve found that sometimes the tasks are at odds with simply driving smoothly and fast, so it can be tough to dominate hard-level AI while also making sure you execute, say, 35 drifts during a sprint event. To conquer the challenges that are generally counterintuitive to quick driving I found myself dialling down the opponent AI from what I usually race against. So long, Frosty. There’s a real off-road flavour to Blizzard Mountain and that has informed the eight new cars included with the new map, a mix of rally monsters, trophy trucks, and utilities (the star vehicle is Ken Block’s 2016 Ford Focus RS RX, as seen in Block’s recent GYMKHANA 9 stunt special, and it’s mental). Of course, we don’t need to stick with those; all of the cars I tried from my extensive Horizon 3 garage could be fitted with snow tyres and taken out on the slopes. If you’re more partial to Horizon 3’s road cars and urban street racing, Blizzard Mountain may not do a huge deal for you, but I do feel the drastically different environment and handling properties make this expansion pack well worth its asking price for any Forza fan. Small in size compared to the full map, Forza Horizon 3: Blizzard Mountain nonetheless packs in a huge pile of fresh races and challenges. It’s kept me busy for days already, and I’ve already played Forza Horizon 3 more than any other game this year. Boasting an absolutely gorgeous environment, terrific snow effects, and just about everything else that’s made Forza Horizon 3 the best racing game this generation, Blizzard Mountain should be a compulsory stopover for anyone looking to expand the Forza Horizon 3 experience, or seeking a good reason to dive back in. The weather outside is frightful, but this game is so delightful.
TJ Hafer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/07/steep-review	 Exploring the expansive, frozen Alps of Steep by means of snowboarding, skis, paragliding, or wingsuit is to tour one of the most diverse and visually interesting open worlds I’ve ever gotten lost in - especially in a sports game. Not all of the featured activities are equally fun, and I was disappointed in the lack of statistical customization, but the array of challenges and their satisfying physics that strike a nice balance between realistic and arcadey rarely left me without something new and exciting to try. Steep is based around a “Play Your Way” philosophy that, in the short term, works well. You can pick from skiing, snowboarding, paragliding, and wingsuit flying (which are all distinct except that snowboarding and skiing share the same courses) and progress through a number of different skill areas geared toward different playstyles. There are rewards for narrowly avoiding obstacles, pulling off complex tricks, exploration, riding creative routes down mountainsides, and even crashing into things or falling on your face and breaking every bone in your body in spectacular fashion. That one is especially entertaining, much in the same way as watching Homer Simpson repeatedly fall down Springfield Gorge.   The problem is that if you decide you like certain playstyles more than others, it can be very difficult (if not impossible) to level up and unlock new peaks. For example, I decided fairly early on that I didn’t like paragliding at all. Slowly drifting around dangling from a parachute is the least intense, least realistic, and least fun out of the four sports, and is mainly useful for scouting out new ski runs and enjoying the scenery at a leisurely pace. So I played my way, and had a good time… until I hit a point near the end where I was short on XP to unlock the final peak and had to go back and run through all of those paragliding challenges I’d skipped. So it’s really: “Play Your Way Unless You Want to Finish the Game.”  Carving down the Matterhorn on a snowboard is intense and engaging. The main element that’s painfully missing from Steep is any kind of stat-based rider customization or progression. While there are hundreds of cosmetic items to unlock, none of them actually change how you ride. XP only serves to unlock new areas, not progress your character or gear, so the board you spawn onto the mountain at Level 1 with feels exactly like the one you unlock for getting a gold medal in the hardest race. Even if Ubisoft wanted to keep the emphasis on player skill, it would have been awesome to unlock some side-grade options, like wider or narrower boards with different handling or the ability to tweak little stuff like binding tightness for different events. Just about everything else Steep does, thankfully, it does really well. Carving down the Matterhorn on a snowboard is intense, engaging, and at times blister-inducingly frantic. Diving from a hot air balloon to glide across glaciers in a wingsuit competes with any superhero game for speed-induced adrenaline. Skiing feels very accurate in that, like real life, I am not any good at it and always end up going backwards at worrying speeds. At high velocity, I always felt my board/skis/wingsuit did what I wanted it to, but the controls can be fiddly and frustrating when you’re trying to slow down and reorient yourself. It usually took me several tries wiggling the thumbsticks around semi-randomly to get back going forwards again once I’d ended up facing the other way.  The Alps look gorgeous on both the PS4 and a high-end PC with a GTX 1070, though level of detail tricks can sometimes be a little too obvious when you look closely at distant terrain. One of the best things about it is the dynamic terrain deformation, which allows you to leave ruts in the powder as you blast down the slopes. It’s detailed enough that you can see the trail from each individual ski and pole separately. If and when I eventually bit it on a big jump, the area where my head skidded through a snowbank remained clearly identifiable.  The map is just awe-inspiringly gargantuan. The map is also just awe-inspiringly gargantuan – it can take a good 15 minutes at full clip to board or ski from its highest summit to the furthest edge, and that’s if you take a relatively direct route. It’s also filled with a massive number of different terrain types, even though they all fall roughly within the theme of “frozen water on big rocks.” There are jagged ice fields, gradual slopes, sheer rock faces, castle ruins, and quaint resort villages to explore across the handful of mountains, each of which is based on a real-world equivalent (though some creative liberties are taken, such as putting them so close together). While there’s not much of a storyline to be found, Steep does feature special challenges called Mountain Stories that range from an intimidating plummet down a ruined bobsled track, to a downright goofy hunt through a forest for a singing tree. Along those same lines, in the grandiose introductory cutscenes you see when you unlock a new peak, each of the major mountains is given a distinctive personality and a human voice. Ortles is inspirational and speaks in a slow, grandfatherly manner, while Aiguille Verte sounds like she’s going to hide in the back seat of your car and murder you. It comes across as slightly unnecessary, but I couldn’t help but chuckle at the charming absurdity of the concept from time to time. It was certainly a nice break from being reminded that Red Bull™ and GoPro™ wanted to see my sick moves at the next The North Face™ Invitational, which is the other kind of storytelling Steep regularly engages in. One of the flagship features of Steep is its multiplayer integration, in which other players will dynamically appear in your instance of the Alps and allow you to easily group up with them and compete in any of the challenges (which also have global leaderboards). There’s also a system for sharing recordings of your best runs, which can be replayed in a variety of camera modes. They’re the kind of features that don’t do much for me, honestly, since I’m more of a solo player in this type of game. But they’re likely to spawn some popular clips on Reddit from people who are far better at virtual snowboarding than I’ll ever be, and that’ll give Steep some extended life. To its credit, none of these multiplayer integrations came across as intrusive or annoying. All the sharing and grouping functionality can be easily ignored if, like me, you just want to be left alone in the cold. I enjoyed just about every minute I spent playing Steep. Grandiose, attractive environments serving as the backdrop to varied, intense challenges are enough on their own to make this wintry playground somewhere I was always delighted to go back to and spend more time in - a feeling I still have even after finishing the bulk of the content, though the lack of mechanical customization and progression makes it harder to find reasons to return. Likewise, the core snowboarding and skiing events are enjoyable enough to easily forgive mediocre elements, like the slow and sleepy paragliding mode, that feel like needless gimmicks. I just wish the latter weren’t mandatory.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/dead-rising-4-review	 The allure of the original Dead Rising’s goofy and gratuitous zombie slaughter was the reason I bought an Xbox 360 back in 2006. Dead Rising 4 ratchets that arcadey, hack-and-slash power fantasy and self-aware satire up to new heights. Even when technical issues rear their ugly heads, that feelgood loop of wading into the horde and coming out the other side has me feeling like a bonafide badass. It's no surprise, then, that Dead Rising 4 is the best incarnation of that satisfying and cathartic gameplay yet. It leans harder than ever into its ridiculous combo and weapon-crafting systems, but the core action gameplay, character progression, creative survival, and attitude are still very much central to this tale.  Frank West is the perfect delivery system for all of that. The cocky photographer’s return to the series after sitting out Dead Rising 2 and 3 is like being reunited with an old friend, despite his being voiced by a new actor. He’s still a wiseass, though he’s 16 years older and a little wiser; a wiserass, if you will. He might be the same self-important, sarcastic asshole with a heart of gold, but if Capcom set out to make Frank seem a little weathered with age, then it’s a job well done. Capcom also absolutely nails the personality, the bizarre charm, and the Christmastime consumerism setting of the Willamette Memorial Megaplex. Holiday decorations adorn the mall and city, and that holiday vibe even extends into the game menus, which pipes out that good department-store Christmas jazz and the kind of rousing orchestral scores that swell when the kid and his family are reunited at the end of a feelgood holiday classic. I'm impressed with the detailed presentation and careful consideration that went into both the world and the story. It would’ve been easy to go full slapstick with this ridiculous premise of yet another zombie outbreak, running down the same road that Saints Row took in later games in the series. But Capcom has balanced the absurdity with equal parts of intelligence and feeling. And for every trying-too-hard line of dialogue like, “Well, set my balls on fire,” that Frank blurts out, there’s a moment of wit or compassion or genuinely loveable buffoonery that becomes the antidote to the obnoxiousness.  And the quiet mystery at the heart of Dead Rising 4 is much more involved and compelling than it needs to be for a game that lets you tape a Segway to a golf cart to build a “Bogey Monster” death machine. There’s much more than a cut-and-dry “Oh no, the zombies are back,” plot at work here, with both callbacks to the original Dead Rising and characters that have more than one layer to them. Some of the ostensibly important relationships between characters end up failing to launch, which I found disappointing until several good secondary characters picked up the slack and turned out to be more than what they appeared. Willamette, too, is more than it first appears to be. The open-world map is made up of the central Willamette Memorial Megaplex (the hulking Mecca of commerce that replaced the original Willamette Mall after the events of Dead Rising), but it’s also surrounded by the fully explorable neighborhoods and rural incorporations, and you can visit those as well. Every area is spread out just enough that it takes a short, deliberate effort to get there, but I prefer the zombie-smearing drive between neighborhoods over the mildly useful fast travel system between shelters and the mall.    The biggest change Dead Rising 4 makes to the traditional Dead Rising formula is the removal of the countdown timer that forced you to rush through objectives and make tough calls to bypass potentially interesting side objectives, negating that sense of urgency earlier games did well. But I found I didn’t miss it much because there’s too much to see, and do, and squish to be satisfied by just 72 in-game hours, as we had in the original. There’s an exhausting number of collectibles and weapon blueprints to find, side mysteries to uncover and solve through investigations, and hidden graffiti art to photograph. Now you’re free to meander, explore, and get lost in this larger, denser version of Willamette. One example of things I was glad I didn’t have to miss are the spontaneous events that spring up from time to time, giving you the opportunity to destroy some communication equipment belonging to the paramilitary bad guys, or rescue a survivor that will go toward upgrading the nearest shelter. Those missions punctuate the endless sea of undead and give welcome structure to wandering through Willamette, even if they only take a minute or two to complete. On the subject of the shelters, I felt underwhelmed by that system in Dead Rising 4. Each shelter is mostly just a hub for vendors to sell you combo weapons and vehicles, alongside maps that mark the location on collectibles on your minimap. They’re useful, but I would’ve loved to see some sort of shelter defense system come into play. These safehouses are just a little too safe. In any case, every collectible you find has real benefit: currency, experience, training manuals, or even just additional context and backstory. There’s incentive for exploring and scavenging, or more realistically getting pleasantly sidetracked for hours at a time, and that activity pads out the roughly 10-hour main storyline. By the time I finally finished the story, I had over 25 hours played, 20,000 zombies killed, and I was nowhere close to hunting down everything I wanted to find. (New Game+ mode gives you the opportunity to go back, though there’s no post-game free-roam mode.)
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/01/the-dwarves-review	" Dwarves fit in with high fantasy as comfortably as Stratocasters fit in with rock 'n' roll, but outside of a few standout works like The Hobbit, they're usually confined to sideshow roles over the likes of elves and humans. Much like the 2003 bestselling novel on which it's based, The Dwarves upends that tradition by placing dwarves at the vanguard, and generally it's a story worth hearing. Judged by the story alone, I'd go so far as to call this one of my favorite RPGs of the year so far, but the deficiencies of its tactical gameplay make it tough to recommend – especially when you can just read the book instead. In some ways it spins a conventional fantasy yarn, and in appearance, the inhabitants of the land of Girdlegard differ only minimally from their counterparts in the likes of Warcraft and The Lord of the Rings. That familiarity extends to the plot itself, with its treacherous wizards and undead hordes. But much as in Markus Heitz's novels, it's the characterizations that allow it to stand out, and developer King Art Games captures them well with banter pulled straight from the books, consistently seasoned with commendable voice acting and attractive cutscenes in a style that resembles artistic stop-motion animation.   An imperious narrator delivers her lines with the cadence of a seasoned dungeon master. Above all, this is the tale of Tungdil, a bookish dwarf who'd never seen his own kind until the mage who raised him sent him out on a lengthy errand. A lot of plot was cut to make it all fit within a somewhat disappointing running time of just 10 hours, but there's also some excellent editing at work here, joining together widely separate events so skillfully that I noticed nothing amiss until I cross-referenced the novel. There's still a lot of exposition, although I admired the skill with which it bounced from character voice acting to an imperious narrator who delivers her lines with the pleasing cadence of a seasoned dungeon master. The one drawback is that most of these interactions tend to take place while Tungdil treks around the sprawling world map, where whole minutes can go by without any proper action. It's an iffy choice, but The Dwarves handles it well as it often breaks up the straight narration by sprinkling in choices of action or dialogue. Sometimes, as in the case of Tungdil's decision to spend the night in either a tree or on the ground, they can mean the difference between ""game over"" and story progression. (Being familiar with the book helps in this regard.) Unfortunately, The Dwarves' fairly strict and understandable adherence to Heitz's story means these choices ultimately have almost no impact on the major events of Tungdil's adventures. It's a fine concept even though it becomes noticeably rushed toward the end, and it would have been good enough to make me call The Dwarves an above-average RPG if the gameplay was up to the same standards. It does have positive qualities, such as the way the story has a noticeable (if minimal) impact on combat, as higher affinity gained through conversations means friendly heroes will regain action points faster when grouped. The Dwarves' combat heavily emphasizes pitting its heroes against overwhelming odds, to the point that Tungdil and the three (out of 14) characters he can take with him into battle often end up swinging axes or slinging spells against 20 orcs or more. It's a little disappointing that each character can only unlock five skills and equip three (choosing between two options, MOBA-like, as they level), but they're usually fun to use in action. When the dwarf Boëndal swings his hammer, a whole horde of orcs could go falling into a canyon. When Andôkai the mage clumps a load of orcs together, it's always rewarding to see her follow it up with a huge explosion. Fun, too, is the heavy focus on environmental interaction, whether it's hacking at columns to bring the roof down or leading orcish swarms into bottlenecks. It's also pleasingly challenging most of the time, to the point that not taking advantage of these options will get Tungdil or a party member killed even on easy mode (thus, a little annoyingly, requiring a reload for anything less than perfection). I even usually enjoyed the frequent pauses to command each character, although hours in I often found myself wishing I could set the heroes' AI to attack without my intervention. These pauses are necessary, as the basic attacks the heroes are independently capable of are about as deadly as slapping a stone slab with a braided beard.  No design decision proves so annoyingly frustrating as the camera. The Dwarves is full of strange design decisions like this, but none proves so annoyingly frustrating as the camera, which can't move freely around the map. Instead, even on the world map, it is locked to center on the targeted character, making it difficult to find objectives on the many scenarios that require the dwarves to do something besides just kill everyone. Second to that is the limited character customization. Likely owing to a desire to stay close to the book, there's a disappointing inability to tinker with weapons or gear. The most you can do is swap out amulets or equip consumables like health potions, which come off as being about as common as elven beards. That's a problem in that The Dwarves' ""pile-on"" approach to encounters makes for some insane difficulty spikes. More than once I found myself backtracking a few saves because I didn't have enough potions for a surprise boss fight. It's also disappointing that the aiming for melee is imprecise at best, making a chore of missions where Tungdil needs to target an NPC in the middle of a monstrous herd. Such design decisions point to a seeming emphasis on the console version, and thus it's strange that the PC version I mainly played was more stable than its Xbox One counterpart with its occasional screen tears and framerate slowdowns. Bugs on the PC version were thankfully minimal, being chiefly limited to rare glitched NPCs in cutscenes and an occasionally finicky autosave. These were never so awful that they made me regret my time with The Dwarves, but the uneven delivery left me disappointed as someone who’d love to see the dwarves have their day. The Dwarves boasts a strong story that's taken from a bestselling novel, and it generally honors that lineage with a cast of likable and ably voiced characters. It's a good foundation, but unfortunately it's not strong enough to make up for the deficiencies of its gameplay, which include unfulfilling RPG elements and a stubborn camera."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	 Final Fantasy XV opens, quite fittingly, with a splash screen that reads: “A Final Fantasy for fans and first-timers.” Having played every numbered entry since the first, I can see both reverence for the old and a courtship of the new in this latest chapter. I’d like to say it’s an elegant fusion of the two, but in reality it’s more of a duality - a conflict that reaches into nearly every aspect of Final Fantasy XV. In the end, its beauty, charm, and commitment to the bond between its four protagonists keep it glued together, even when some of its design and story elements threaten to pull it apart. Prince Noctis and fellow travelers Gladiolus, Ignis, and Prompto aren’t a loosely assembled band of strangers uniting to face evil, like in so many other roleplaying games - they are close, long-time friends, and it’s this closeness that gives Final Fantasy XV’s often incoherent story all the heart it has. While the danger that befalls the land of Lucis never truly materializes until the end of the tale and the would-be romantic element of the story never gets more than a handful of weepy, insubstantial cutscenes, the mutual respect, understanding, and kinship of these four is fleshed out and reinforced beautifully whether in combat, on the road, or everywhere in between.  Fully real-time combat is the single biggest departure from the turn-based systems of the past, and while it doesn’t feel like the other main-line Final Fantasy games in any regard, the way it makes you and your three AI-controlled compatriots feel like a cohesive fighting unit kept it mostly enjoyable for me. Well-placed flanking strikes are rewarded with big damage and slickly animated team-up attacks, and commanding one of your buds to use one of their stylish-looking special attacks at just the right moment can be a literal blast. Especially here, the banter flies as they cheer each other on and pick one another up when they fall. They turn monster-slaying into family bonding time, and I love it.   It certainly doesn’t hurt that they’re all exceedingly competent in battle. Assuming you keep their gear up to date and you aren’t poking things too many levels above you with a pointy stick, they’ll generally notch almost as many kills as you will, which is great when taking on medium- to large-sized groups. They switch between whatever spells and weapons they have equipped fairly intelligently, and even swoop in to get you on your feet if you’re incapacitated. Though Noctis is more well-rounded statistically (and can wield any weapon type), his three wards feel more or less like his equals. That their usefulness makes battles look like Avengers-style swirling melees isn’t the only upshot, either; it also makes them feel vital, further reinforcing the themes of closeness and brotherhood that make up the backbone of the story.  While the visual and thematic payoffs are big, the actual mechanics of battle are sadly quite thin. Holding circle performs a continuous combo string on whatever is closest, and holding square allows you to dodge or block nearly all attacks from any direction as long as your mana holds out. This can turn combat into a fairly passive experience at times, though Noctis’ teleportation abilities do make things slightly more interesting. Warping up to a distant cliffside to catch your breath and then blindsiding your target with a huge warp strike that sends them tumbling to the ground certainly looks and feels great, as do the wide array of cool-looking parry animations for countering specific enemy attacks. Battles look like Avengers-style swirling melees.  But such cliffsides are always expressly designated and marked with a nice shiny icon as a place for you to do exactly that, and parrying those attacks is a simple matter of following big flashing button prompts with extremely generous timing windows on them. In this way, Final Fantasy XV regularly packages and serves you these impressive-looking combat moments rather than having you truly earn them dynamically, which kept me from ever really feeling like Noctis’ power was my own. It’s not so strange for melee combat to be straightforward in a Final Fantasy game, where tactical variety typically comes in the form of a diverse set of magical abilities and/or Summon spells. However, it’s in these categories where Final Fantasy XV’s combat is weakest, largely because of all of the limitations placed on their use.  Spells are both tied to a cooldown period and are limited-use consumables that need to be replenished by absorbing elemental energy from designated deposits and enemies - not completely unlike the much-maligned Draw system of Final Fantasy VIII. Even worse, spell variety is downright anemic, with only the most basic black magic stalwarts of Fire, Ice, and Thunder (and their second and third rank equivalents) making the cut. An odd spellcrafting system allows you to make small tweaks, like a fire spell that heals the caster, or an ice spell that poisons the target, but such effects are usually secondary and comparatively limited in magnitude. Fortunately, what magic lacks in variety, it generally makes up in overall usefulness thanks to the devastating amounts of damage it’s capable of dealing. What magic lacks in variety, it generally makes up in overall usefulness.  Speaking of mass devastation, it wouldn’t be a Final Fantasy without Summon spells, and Final Fantasy XV’s are positively spectacular-looking. These are traditionally the biggest guns in your arsenal, and it’s no different here. I have yet to see a fight that a Summon can’t end in jaw-dropping fashion, but disappointingly, that’s only happened a mere handful of times for me. You won’t acquire your first Summon until deep into the 40-hour journey, and even once you do, you cannot call them in at will. Even after playing all the way through and getting some hints from Square Enix on how to trigger them, the exact method still eludes me. The secret seems to be a random mix of how badly hurt my party is, how badly hurt my enemies are, and how long I’ve been fighting for. This unpredictable nature kept them from adding any extra element of tactical choice to the action, but the upside is that every time I got to call one in it felt special and rare.  This minimized role of magic hurts, though, seeing as how the melee elements don’t provide a lot of interesting decisions to make or techniques to master, unless you count wrestling with the occassionally unruly camera. Especially in enclosed spaces, and even during some climactic boss fights, the camera becomes your biggest enemy, sometimes completely obscuring the action from you, which can be frustrating. That all said though, the promise of gorging my retinas on more eye candy and watching these four bond ‘n’ battle like better-dressed versions of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles kept me looking forward to my next scrap.   The open world of Lucis is huge, and its towering geographic features and sweeping, wide-open plains give it a rare sense of scale. Though exploring it was easily my favorite part of Final Fantasy XV, the logistics of getting around take some getting used to at first. There’s actually a fair bit to learn if you want to travel safely and efficiently. Time is constantly flowing, and traveling at night, even by car, is dangerous. You’ll need to think about keeping your ride fueled up, paying for chocobo rentals for long off-road trips where your car can’t go, where to spend the night, and even what to eat. Though initially inconvenient, these extra steps do make the simple act of getting from point A to B feel like an actual trip. There are fast-travel options between previously explored points, but generally you have to actually make each journey at least once. This deliberate, regimented structure really drew me into the world, and also gave the relationships between the characters time to develop in innumerable little ways.  I know Ignis’ favorite brand of coffee and why he doesn’t mind doing all the driving and cooking. I know Gladiolus’ favorite food and that despite his gruff, aggressive demeanor, he likes to pull out a book and quietly read during long drives. I can tell you for sure that Prompto hates bugs but loves chocobos, which he sometimes sings about for no apparent reason at all. These details aren’t connected to events in the plot, either; just observations I’ve made from hours of car rides, long walks, and meals shared. I can’t remember the last group of video game characters I could speak about with this level of familiarity, and it’s because Final Fantasy XV turns every aspect of this travel routine into an opportunity to showcase their personalities. I can’t remember the last group of video game characters I could speak about with this level of familiarity.  But there’s more than just bromance on the open road. There are tons of side missions to participate in, including plenty that have a higher level requirement than the final leg of the main story (which means you’ll have plenty to do post-game). The search for some optional weapons for Noctis led to hidden dungeons and some of the best boss fights, though some of the higher-level hunting missions feature baddies that give even those bosses a run for their money. If all the traveling and fighting is getting to be too much you can just do some chocobo races, bet on monster fights at the arena, or (my favorite) fish the day away in pursuit of the perfect catch. It’s all a little spread out, but between the banter, the vistas, the combat, and the side activities, I was always engaged in one way or another. It’s just a shame that the story more or less washes its hands of the open world for most of its second half. You can return to it pretty much whenever you’d like to, but narratively, it’s dropped in favor of a series of one-off areas that are extremely linear and generally less interesting than what I’d been doing in the first half. One particularly painful section temporarily strips Noctis of his friends, his powers, and his gear, forcing him down narrow corridor after narrow corridor for almost two hours.  Here especially, Final Fantasy XV feels like two different games: one for seasoned adventurers with wanderlust in their heart, and another for people who want tight levels and scripted action scenes. Sure, I could have gone back to the open world to take a breather when I needed to, but I don’t want to have to choose between advancing the story and having fun – but a decision that Final Fantasy XV’s back third had me constantly making. That isn’t to say it’s all downhill once Lucis is in your rear-view though. One chapter is spent in a stunning city at sea, featuring a full, Venice-like gondola system and some truly breathtaking views. Another had Noctis warping in mid-air from dropship to dropship in an attempt to repel an Imperial onslaught, and the final hours of the journey brought more than one memorable boss fight as well as a great emotional payoff for Noctis and friends. While some parts of Final Fantasy XV’s procession of linear experiences are infuriating, many of them are memorable in their own right. I just wish I hadn’t been pulled away from the open world to experience them.   There are so many things, both big and small, that give this series its own distinct flavor, and for all the ways that Final Fantasy XV diverges from the established ideas of its numbered predecessors, it also pays loving homage to its lineage - and it does so with alluring warmth and panache.  Part of this can certainly be chalked up to the generous dollops of fan service Square Enix has spooned over the entire experience. You can collect and listen to the soundtracks of every Final Fantasy ever, 16-bit portraits of your party members raise their hands in approval as you browse the wares in a weapon shop, and Prompto sometimes belts out an acapella version of the old Final Fantasy victory music like a 10-year-old singing along to his favorite musical. There are oddly expensive curios hidden away in select item shops that you just know are going to be part of some silly hidden quest, and of course there are fully fleshed-out mini-games that you can lose hours to before you know it. It’s all just so quintessentially Final Fantasy-esque – you know, there’s always a Cid, there’s always crystal, and all of that. There is always a Cid, there is always a crystal.  But Final Fantasy XV’s charm comes in plenty of flavors besides nostalgia too. Its various well-realized cities range from sleepy coastal factory towns to opulent Euro-chic metropoli, and they’re flush with back alleys, street vendors, locals buzzing about how their wife just got a promotion, and tourists fawning over the delicious local fare. The many rest stops and outposts in between smack oddly of 1950s middle-Americana, complete with family-style chain diners that serve exactly the kind of food you’d expect, and family-owned motels of questionable health standards. All of this stands in stark contrast to the high/techno-fantasy motifs that modern Final Fantasy games are known for, a look represented here mostly through the brief glimpses we get of the capital cities of the story’s two warring factions. Little slices of it intermingle with the pervasive rustic trappings, though. Sleek, menacing Imperial dropships look practically alien as they cast their shadows across abandoned ramshackle farmhouses, and your car, aptly named the Regalia, is a stark symbol of the relative privilege and power Noctis is a product of. Though the story never leverages these visual themes, the way they mirror the rural/urban dichotomy of many developed, real-world countries made the realm of Lucis all the more real for me.  Further solidifying this sense of immersion is the technical and artistic prowess that brings it all to life. Never compromising in either scale or detail, Final Fantasy XV is constantly and thoroughly beautiful. Long draw distances and well-tempered daytime lighting make the open plains of Lucis feel airy and vibrant, but not at the expense of texture quality. Spell and hit effects are polished to a high sheen, and even the most basic of low-level enemy fodder are bristling with little details to pick out. It becomes especially apparent when playing with a PS4 Pro in high-resolution mode on a 4K TV. Pro owners without a 4K set can opt for standard resolution, which will look comparable to a regular PS4 but runs just slightly smoother. No matter your setup, though, seeing Iron Giants, Behemoths, and Chocobos at this level of fidelity is a huge treat. When I’m riding chocobos across the beach at dusk with my three friends and hunting iconic Final Fantasy monsters in a huge, picturesque open world, Final Fantasy XV feels like nearly everything I could want from a modern Final Fantasy. But when it funnels me into linear scenarios and drab, constricted spaces that plunge the simplistic combat into chaos, my blood boils a bit. There is so much good here, so much heart - especially in the relationships between Noctis and his sworn brothers. It just comes with some changes and compromises that were, at times, difficult for this long-time Final Fantasy fan to come to grips with.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/watch-dogs-2-review	 By expanding on a lot of what the first game and its expansion got right and mixing action, stealth, and puzzle gameplay with handy remote-control drones, Watch Dogs 2 impresses with open mission designs with multiple ways to reach your objective and some great toys to find them with. I’m conflicted about the tone of its story and characters, but I had a great time exploring its Bay Area map. This is a significant improvement over the original Watch Dogs in nearly every way. One of the chief complaints about the original Watch Dogs was that its “fixer” hacker protagonist, Aiden Pearce, is a bland and unlikeable character. Ubisoft listened and left Pearce in Chicago, picking up in the Bay Area with the much more personable hacker vigilante Marcus Holloway, who is motivated not by blind revenge but by a philosophy and doesn’t always take himself seriously. Aside from a few cringe-inducing jokes, I like Marcus a lot more. Even though he and his vigilante hacker gang, Dedsec, are a little obnoxious and petty about their crusade against the Orwellian surveillance state this version of America has become, they’re generally relatable.   But, surprise twist: that’s kind of an issue, because I just don’t buy Marcus as a killer who mows people down by the dozen with gaudy, 3D-printed assault weapons. The way he’s portrayed in the cutscenes ranting against the misuse of people’s personal information is passionate, and he seems like a fundamentally good person. And then the mission begins and he might wipe out a group of private security guards, gang members, or worse, actual San Francisco Police, before going back to being relatively happy-go-lucky in the cutscenes again, unfazed by all the murder and chaos. It’s a weird disconnect that feels different than roleplaying as a violent criminal like Trevor Philips or Michael de Santa, and though it didn’t affect the mechanics it was something I was constantly noticing and feeling off about.  Watch Dogs 2 is as much a stealth game as it is an action game. Because there’s no morality system to punish (or reward) violent behavior, Marcus’ personality is the only thing pushing us toward a non-lethal playstyle of stealth and silent takedowns. While it’s not as built out as something like Hitman (you can’t, for example, hide unconscious bodies to avoid detection) Watch Dogs 2 is as much a stealth game as it is an action game. Finding a silent path to an objective is a more interesting and challenging way to play that makes you use all your tools, including drones that can drive through small spaces or fly to hack something you couldn’t reach. They’re great for scoping out an area before you charge in yourself. It’s a shame that efforts to keep the body count down aren’t recognized, though – even perfectly ghosting a mission gives you the same reward as turning everyone you meet into ghosts.   Though I attempted it anyway, non-lethal techniques aren’t quite enough when you’re caught in the midst of a high-tech heist. You can melee people and knock them out (or maybe getting hit in the face by Marcus’ improvised melee weapon kills them, I’m not entirely sure), and you have an infinite-ammo stun gun that can incapacitate people at range, but it’s slow to fire (even with an upgrade). It’s no match for a wave of guards with SMGs, and so, not always for the better, out come the big guns.  You have enough means of indirect attack to feel capable in a fight. Shootouts ensue, using the same cover-based shooting that’s all but ubiquitous with open-world crime games. Watch Dogs 2 feels a little different than most because even on normal difficulty you’re not very durable, and the AI is reasonably good at using cover and aggressively flanking. (Also, a lot more of San Francisco gangs have hand grenades than I’d have thought.) But you have enough means of indirect attack to feel capable in a fight, and some of them are great fun. Explosive-carrying enemies can be hacked to detonate their bombs, some can be stunned by overloading their headset communications gear, and anyone who happens to be standing near a hackable piece of equipment in the environment can be shocked or blown up at the push of a button.   But my favorite is the ability to summon angry gang members or police and target them at whoever you like by fabricating evidence. It’s not just a means of attack, it’s a fantastic distraction: I love calling them in on the far side of an area and then running in to grab my objective while the guards are too busy dealing with them to notice me. This hilarious power can be abused in a semi-game-breaking way: you can keep calling them in (after your power meter recharges) until every enemy is dead without lifting a finger.  You usually have more than one option on every hackable item. Hacking in general is more flexible than in the first Watch Dogs - you usually have more than one option on every hackable item. For example, you can open a door with a hack, or you can choose to lock it so that no one can follow you for a few seconds. You can detonate an electrical box to stun someone nearby, make it go haywire to attract attention, or turn it into a mine that will detonate when someone gets close. If anything, there may be too many hackable items scattered around, to the point where I often have trouble selecting the right one in situations where timing matters.   This is a great open world map, and I’m not just saying that because was born in the Bay Area and have lived here for almost my entire life. Watch Dogs 2’s version is super condensed, with entire neighborhoods left on the cutting room floor, but it has all the major landmarks pretty much where they should be. (Thankfully the perpetually gridlocked traffic was omitted.) It’s a fun and diverse place to explore and run amok, and it’s surreal to be in a car chase and suddenly look up and see something like Moscone Center, the Palace of Fine Arts, the Painted Ladies, Fisherman’s Wharf, or Stanford University. I’d recommend it as virtual tourism, especially if you’ve been here before and want a refresher.   There's also quite a bit of satire about the San Francisco area and its culture, but nothing approaching HBO’s Silicon Valley’s wit. A lot of its humor comes through in the random bios that pop up when you hack civilians, some of whom can give you jokey snippets of phone calls or text conversations, all the while humanizing the crowds and making me less enthusiastic about trying to run them over on purpose.

Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	 Assassin’s Creed: The Ezio Collection does a wonderful job of reminding me how great the three-game arc of Ezio Auditore's life story was on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, while also reminding me just how much the series has evolved and improved over the past seven years. But while the frame rate and load times in the Xbox One and PS4 compilation are a big improvement over last-gen’s original games, there are some baffling lighting and texture degradations throughout the trilogy. Experiencing Ezio’s life from literal birth to death is still every bit as exciting and emotional as it was back in 2009. Watching him grow from a brash rogue to a contemplative elder remains fantastic, and aside from the dynamic between Syndicate’s siblings, my favorite story in the AC series. But playing through Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations highlights just how much the series’ gameplay has improved over the years. The horizontal and downward parkour of Black Flag and Unity made moving through their respective worlds a joy, which is something I can’t say about the ample moments where I found Ezio unintentionally clinging to surfaces around Italy. While I feel like I was able to forgive these hiccups back in 2009, it’s tough to stomach them in a post-Syndicate world.   The trilogy runs in 1080p at a steady 30 frames per second, which is great considering the framerate hiccups that existed across the original games, but disappointing in that Ubisoft couldn’t wring 60 frames out of a last-gen game. At least some of that power goes toward better draw distance, which alleviates some of the pop-in issues we saw on PS3 and 360. Sweeping shots of Rome and Constantinople when you unlock a viewpoint still look gorgeous, even in 2016. Also, the lengthy load times of the original games have also been vastly improved. This is especially noticeable and appreciated when you’re hopping back and forth between your villa and the open world. But while the games generally use what appear to be the same hi-res textures as the PC versions from back in the day, there are lighting and texture issues peppered throughout the collection, most noticeably in Assassin’s Creed 2. This makes the world feel somewhat flat, and removes some of the life from the otherwise-bustling cities. Ubisoft hasn’t really improved how these games look, and certain NPC character faces look downright bizarre. Both of those issues pulled me out of the immersion.   Like the Uncharted Nathan Drake Collection, the Ezio Collection isn’t quite complete. It bundles in all of the trilogy’s single-player DLC, but strips away the multiplayer modes of Brotherhood and Revelations. That’s not a huge loss, since these were always single-player focused games, but something to be aware of. It also comes with Assassin’s Creed Lineage and Embers, a pair of short films that help fill in the corners of Ezio’s life story. While these are appreciated, it would’ve been nice to have some concept art or behind-the-scenes documentaries that let fans of the trilogy dive deeper into its development and legacy. The biggest issue is I don’t know who to recommend this collection for. It doesn’t include enough improvements or bonus material to coax fans of the trilogy to jump back in, and it’s also hard to recommend it to newcomers to the series when later games like Black Flag and Syndicate look and play so much better. Ezio’s trilogy helped build Assassin’s Creed into the giant franchise it is today thanks to its fantastic storytelling, amazing characters, and gorgeous world building. And while all of that is still here in The Ezio Collection, the lack of meaningful improvements and any sort of substantial bonus content make it a tough compilation to recommend.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	 Update: Dishonored 2 has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  No two playthroughs are the same in Dishonored 2. Developer Arkane has doubled down on the original’s play-your-way formula with two separate sets of skills, a deep and multifaceted world, and a dizzying array of level designs that affect your approach to each new area. Whether you choose a stealthy or bloody approach, each one of your playthroughs is an addition to the wide range of stories that can be told within this wonderfully twisted universe. 15 years have gone by since the events of the original Dishonored, and the world of Empress of the Isles, Emily Kaldwin, is once again thrown into disarray when her evil aunt appears with suspicious designs on her throne. It’s a pedestrian catalyst to your most vital decision in Dishonored 2: will you play as Emily or her father and protector (and original Dishonored protagonist), Corvo Attano? Though their stories play out in much the same way, with well-crafted and low-key dialogue tailored to your character, it’s worth taking time to consider your choice, as it’s one you are stuck with for the rest of your 12 to 16-hour playthrough, depending on whether you choose high-chaos (quicker) or low (slower).   Splitting abilities and story details up between Emily and Corvo is a smart call on Arkane’s part, as the developer has put a lot of focus on each character’s individual skills, which can only be built up through time and a careful and considered search for upgrade-granting collectibles. Both Emily and Corvo work excellently in either a stealth style or violent playthrough, despite their different supernatural abilities. Their basics are much the same, though. For those who want to play with a focus on combat, a wide range of ammo is available for your pistol and crossbow, and mines can be used to either stun or dismember your enemies. Should you prefer to play stealthily, each character has the handy ability to choke out enemies during combat if you parry them just right, and knock out enemies by dropping on them from above for a quiet takedown. In terms of supernatural abilities, Emily’s Far Reach works in much the same way as Corvo’s short-range Blink teleport, and both characters can be equipped with Dark Vision, allowing them to see enemies through walls to aid in stealth. Where they differ is in the more advanced unlockable powers in the later stages that ramps up the fun. Take Emily’s Domino ability, for example: it links enemies together so they share the same fate. You can use this power to take down several enemies at once with a single sleeping dart while hidden in the rafters, or blast one enemy with your pistol and joyfully watch the blood spurt from a multitude of skulls. If you’re playing as Corvo your options are just as much of a good time: his Bend Time ability can stop time altogether in its later stages, allowing for magnificent slow-mo kills or a magical escape after assassinating someone the old-fashioned way. All of their abilities can be combined in various ways, too, and playful experimentation makes for Dishonored 2’s most hilarious water-cooler moments. With careful timing and preparation, you can send one of Emily’s Doppelgangers into a fray, link her with several guards using Domino, then watch them attack her and unwittingly cut themselves to pieces. Or you could stop time with Corvo while fighting some enemies in an alleyway and possess a nearby rat, leaving them confused about where their prey has gone. In its best moments Dishonored 2 makes you feel like you can control any situation in any number of creative ways.    You can’t lean too heavily on one approach in Dishonored 2 though, because Arkane keeps switching up central gameplay mechanics in each chapter, and that makes each one feel vital and distinct. In the Dust District, for example, billows of dust will obscure your vision every five minutes or so - but also the guards’, giving you opportunities to slip by that don’t exist on any other map. In the Clockwork Mansion, the layout of each floor can be changed using levers, allowing for quick getaways or access to secret areas. In The Royal Conservatory, you must deal with enemies who can teleport in the same way you do. Those changes all have to be incorporated into your approach to any given situation. Such unpredictable additions to an already complex world kept me constantly alert and thinking as I pursued my targets. And because mortality is ultimately a binary choice in Dishonored - kill fewer NPCs and you’ll be granted a ‘happier’ ending; kill more and you’ll progress more easily - this focus is very important.    Meanwhile, Dishonored 2’s world is busy doing a great job of accommodating any brand of chaos you can throw at it. The Southern-European-kissed city of Karnaca is not only beautiful, filled with lush greenery and hugged-by-a-whale-boat peppered harbour, but it’s as dense with secrets as Dishonored’s Dunwall, with layers of guard-infested main paths, twisting alleyways, hidden entrances, and tall, bloodfly-infested buildings. While I did notice some pop-in issues on the PlayStation 4 (which I’ve exclusively played on for this review) in open areas - and one crash - they were no deal-breakers, and overall the detail Arkane has managed to stuff into Dishonored 2 is astounding. The gorgeous, painterly aesthetic has been carried over from the original, and every piece of furniture, artwork and branded oddity feels considered and cohesive. Part of the joy of exploring Karnaca is to uncover Arkane’s dense world building, from the eccentric advertisements to the newspapers expanding on the lore of the world - the suspects in a murder case, for example, or the technological advancements created by crazed industrialists that are shaking up the world.   The city feels alive. Unlike the streets of the original's Dunwall, where a rat plague was used as rationale behind their emptiness, Karnaca is thriving. NPCs beckon you over to give you an optional quest; a shopkeeper might unexpectedly ask you to hide from an approaching gang, or you’ll overhear a couple of blood-splattered whalers discussing the repercussions of something you did a chapter or two ago. As far as I can tell after two playthroughs, this (and more appearances of the deadly bloodfly nests based on the number of people you’ve killed) is about the extent of how your actions affect the world at large, minute-to-minute, but it’s still a neat touch. The AI feels alive, too. Common enemies are incredibly receptive to the slightest movement, which means troubles for you if you attack one too loudly within a big group. It’s fun to mess around with them because of their attentiveness and their reactions to en masse attacks - draw an enemy’s attention over to a stun mine by throwing a bottle or making a noise, link him to his friends with Domino, and you can clear the area by exploiting human-like behavior on the first try. But perhaps the most fun you can have with Dishonored 2’s AI is with its Clockwork Soldiers. They’re tall, tough clockwork robots with knives for arms that can kill you with a single swipe, but they’re receptive to movement, so if you blind one it will attack anything it senses... including other enemies. They, more than any other AI in Dishonored 2, are walking opportunities. The liveliness in Dishonored 2’s world encourages a constant drive to explore, which is both rewarding due to the way interesting things are spread around the maps and also helpful during main quests. You are an assassin, but there are always at least two ways to dispense of your final mark in Dishonored 2 - and one of those can only be unlocked through careful examination of clues and evidence scattered around the area. During my second playthrough, I discovered vital information I’d breezed past in my first by paying particular attention to an important letter I’d ignored the first time around, and I imagine there’ll still be more to uncover in my third.

Kallie Plagge	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	" Once held up as the great example for contemporary-era shooters, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is now an enlightening time capsule for an style of Call of Duty that no longer exists. When IGN first reviewed it back in 2007, we gave it a 9.4 and said this about it: ""Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is a fantastic game. The single-player experience is easily Infinity Ward's best work to date. Calling it intense may be an understatement. The overall story is standard action movie fare, but the relationships built over the short five hours of play are surprisingly strong. Though the single-player lacks length, the multiplayer should keep you invested in COD4 for the long winter. This is a truly fantastic multiplayer offering that's as deep as any other online game available. Infinity Ward has done it again. Call of Duty 4 is a winner."" Read the full original Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare review here. After years of futuristic CoDs, going back to the present day with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare Remastered is a welcome return to combat that makes me feel simultaneously powerful and helpless due to the way it’s both literally and figuratively grounded. Though the sprawling level design and pacing are definitely dated, the core of Modern Warfare’s combat has aged remarkably well, and that foundation keeps its action movie-style campaign and its multiplayer fun even nine years later. However, outside of its impressive face lift it offers only a few additions to make it feel new to returning players.   My strongest memories of my original runs through Modern Warfare’s campaign were of levels like the tense, stealth-focused All Ghillied Up and the hectic race against the clock that is Mile High Club. Those missions still play well even though they’ve been emulated and improved upon countless times in the years since. Lying underfoot as tanks and an enemy squadron passed over me was even more exciting and petrifying in HD — the grass and the tanks look way better than before, of course, which adds to the dramatic and cinematic nature of the iconic level.  Modern Warfare's combat has aged remarkably well.  But in Remastered, it’s the combat that stands out most. Modern Warfare’s relatively human-feeling speed and range of movement is unchanged, and that means things like mantling, reloading, and throwing grenades require the same (sometimes appropriately slow or clumsy) timing. It left me feeling relatively weighed down, encumbered, and more desperate in the fray. Desperately running through Mile High Club on Veteran, for example, is just as gratifying as it once thanks to Remastered’s faithful preservation of the original’s movement timing.   Animations and graphics are significantly better than the 2007 version, though not quite as good as a new CoD. Textures are sharp, faces are completely redone and brought nearly up to modern standard, lighting and effects are greatly enhanced, materials like wood and brick have updated ballistics physics, and even the campaign runs in a smooth 60 frames per second. This is an impressive update in most respects, and it has far more than the simple retexturing and increased resolution we see in most remasters. But there are cracks in the facade; a checkpoint-triggered cloud of smoke near the end of the campaign was jarringly rough around the edges, for instance, and there were times when I’d get momentarily stuck on the geometry of a door and unceremoniously shoved to the side by a scripted ally charging through. That’s the kind of clumsy that’s less endearing.  This update includes far more than the simple retexturing we see in most remasters.  There are moments that still truly stand out in Modern Warfare Remastered, brought into relief by much-improved graphics. In particular, the nuclear explosion in Shock and Awe and the short death scene in Aftermath both hit much harder in the remaster, even knowing they were coming — crawling helplessly by a dying squadmate coughing out her last breaths is more upsetting when her expression is brought into focus. And the point of the mission is more meaningful for it. Sometimes being a hero and fulfilling the objectives isn’t enough. That message is timeless.   The still-strong combat fundamentals combine with campaign levels that send swarms of enemies your way to make for white-knuckle warfare that still works. On higher difficulties, sacrificing mobility by throwing myself down to the ground to go prone or finding cover at the very last second made me feel powerless; even calling in an airstrike or commandeering an enemy’s RPG felt like it put me right in the enemy’s crosshairs as opposed to helping me get out of them safely. It made me flex FPS muscles I haven’t used in a while.  Modern Warfare's combat requires a different set of FPS skills from a new CoD.  That muscle memory carries over to multiplayer. Where modern CoD is fast and bombastic, Modern Warfare’s multiplayer is chaotic and explosive in a very different way — you can’t double-jump your way out of the line of fire, so finding cover from gunfire or taking shelter from an airstrike in a wrecked building is paramount. I relished running to safety at the last second as bombs come down around me — it feels urgent, and it’s still really satisfying even next to a contemporary, faster CoD. That’s not to say that Modern Warfare is slower in all respects, though, since it still has CoD’s signature quick time to kill.   The level design itself has definitely aged less than gracefully, though. Modern Warfare Remastered’s linear warzones littered with blown-out cars and buildings scattered haphazardly throughout still work in that they contribute to the stress of finding shoddy cover or a decent vantage point, but a lot of the campaign levels and most of the multiplayer maps are designed for little more than to create areas to duck behind, as opposed to a more modern map design that makes good use of vertical space and gives you options in combat for a competitive match. Bog and Overgrown in particular are frustratingly muddled maps with arbitrarily open spaces and buildings that serve only as unnecessary clutter — they’re fun for some low-key matches, but trying to go for a real strategy in Team Deathmatch on those maps was only frustrating.  Some multiplayer maps don't work for more competitive strategy.  As far as new content that was not in the original version, Remastered doesn’t bring a lot to the table. There are no developer commentaries or behind-the-scenes featurettes (which may be due to the fact that much of the original talent is now at Respawn). The biggest change is that it’s retroactively added Modern Warfare 3’s Kill Confirmed to the lineup of multiplayer game modes, which is a good call — it’s one of my favorite ways to mitigate any map problems. Kill Confirmed definitely discourages camping by making you go to your target’s location and collect tags after getting a kill, and that helps keeps the game moving. Also, be aware that while Modern Warfare Remastered currently includes only 10 of the original maps, six more are planned to roll out for free in December. Put simply, Modern Warfare is no longer modern — though the combat and, in some ways, the action-movie story at its foundation are ageless, its level design and lack of campaign progression reveal its true age. But it’s not outdated, it’s classic, and the considerable effort that has gone into improving the models, textures, and effects have enhanced it enough that playing through the campaign again was rewarding. Multiplayer also benefits from the graphics upgrade, and its refreshingly old-school pace is fun and explosive in its own right. It might not have the same effect it did the first time around, but it works as both a great embodiment of what shooters used to be and one that still plays well."
Joab Gilroy	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	" A leap into futuristic space combat hasn’t breathed a lot of new life into Call of Duty. With a scenic but poorly paced single-player campaign and multiplayer and zombies modes that succeed mostly by sticking close to what Black Ops 3 did last year, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare is a generally fun but inessential shooter. 2016 has been one of the best years for single-player shooter campaigns of the past decade. We’ve seen Doom, Titanfall 2, Gears of War 4, Battlefield 1, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided… and they're all better than Infinite Warfare’s campaign. It's not for want of something to differentiate it: this is a Call of Duty game where you fight in zero-G environments, and where you fly a spaceship called a Jackal and have a robot buddy called Ethan who is endearingly written. It should be awesome... but it’s mostly slow and plodding, and by the time the pace picks up there’s not enough game left to wash the disappointment of the first two-thirds out of your mouth.  In the campaign, you are the effortlessly charming Reyes, a United Nations Space Alliance (UNSA) Navy pilot with Tom Cruise-like features and swagger, and you're promoted to captain of a starship when the Settlement Defence Front (SDF) — a Mars-based terror organisation with significant resources — removes the previous captain from his command.  Every SDF quote would make a Sith Lord pause. You can tell the SDF are the bad guys because loading screens are littered with quotes from them, and every single one would make a Sith Lord pause. ""Freedom has no place in the light of our sun."" That's a direct quote from the SDF High Council, and according to another loading screen the SDF has an Elite Propaganda Unit called The Veritas. If that's the propaganda the Veritas is letting out, imagine what other cartoonish evil they're hiding. Kit Harrington (Game of Thrones) leads them by way of a stereotypically evil British accent.   The entire cast works hard to keep you invested in the story. The dialogue is well written, even if the plot itself fails to make sense at times. For example, Staff Sergeant Omar (David Harewood of Homeland) sells his hatred of the robot E3N (Jeffrey Nordling from 24) like an android screwed him over on the Nostromo. And when he's best friends with E3N (or Ethan) in the next mission for unconvincing reasons, he sells that as well. The cast commit to their roles wholeheartedly. Being that the SDF are literally freedom-haters and you are Joe America, it is your job to find and dismantle them, once and for all. Infinite Warfare contorts itself in an effort to nail that gung-ho, “Ooh-Rah” militaristic tone closely associated with the Call of Duty series, despite the science-fiction setting.  This is an action-movie universe where sound travels through space. Consistency is an issue which repeats itself throughout Infinite Warfare as it works hard to build out its Earth-versus-wayward-colonies fiction. It's heavily reminiscent of James S. A. Corey's The Expanse series, but it lacks the attention to detail necessary to make the science in the fiction stick. This is an action-movie universe where sound travels through space with ease, prolonged exposure to open space is survivable, and you can collide with things at hypervelocity without disintegrating. It acts like it wants to be a serious sci-fi story without giving up the dream of also being Star Wars. This is at its worst when you're shooting early on, because the ballistic weapons you start out with do too little damage to people in space.   This is a problem, because one of the few things Call of Duty can typically be counted on to deliver is the feel of a good shooter. Low time-to-kill (TTK) is one of the factors that creates the signature pace of the series, but Infinite Warfare messes with that. Too many enemies are armoured, increasing that TTK and forcing you to wait behind cover as you wear them down, slowing things dramatically. A cover-leaning system allows you to duck out without fully exposing yourself, but you still take a significant amount of damage as you acquire targets and shoot them – once to remove their helmet and again to put them down. On higher difficulties, it's safer to just wait behind cover until you’re regenerated and then charge back into action than to risk being beaned while leaning, rendering the cover system moot.  The tools to smooth out the combat are right there, but Infinite Ward doesn't want to let us use them. There's a wealth of weaponry and gadgetry available, but it's drip-fed to you at an unsatisfying pace throughout the campaign. Items like the Seeker drones and ATADs (automated robots designed to find your enemies and kill them) give you oodles of power while also feeling futuristic. Energy rifles, arcing laser cannons, and self-targeting shotguns demonstrate clever weapon design. But you spend most of your time without access to the stand-out heavy weapons (or without the ammunition to use them), which further increased my annoyance with the bullet-spongey enemies. The tools to smooth out the combat are right there, but Infinite Warfare doesn't want to let us use them.   As the story continues and your weapons get better, these problems solve themselves. Those energy weapons shred through the robots which litter the rear half of the campaign, and the pace picks up again as you careen towards the ending. Sadly, at five-and-a-half hours long, Infinite Warfare is just starting to feel good when it ends. In the final act, the action plays at a pace and tempo that few games can manage the way Call of Duty does. But prior to that final third, it feels like it's going on forever.  There just isn't five-and-a-half hours' worth of game in it. There just isn't five-and-a-half hours' worth of game in it. Compare it to last year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, or even last week's Titanfall 2, and it seems ludicrous. Both have campaigns that are longer, but neither feels like they’re dragging along. They lack the flat spots peppered through the first two-thirds of Infinite Warfare, and both feature highly varied gameplay from moment to moment. Infinite Warfare, by contrast, is largely the same three gameplay loops repeated. You're either flying a Jackal (your dogfighting spaceship), shooting in corridors, or shooting in zero-G.   Part of the pacing problem comes from the fact that a significant portion of your time is spent treading water as you meander through the bridge of your capital ship, the Retribution. At the end of a mission you walk to the bridge – a 30-metre trek which exists to give you the option to watch a news story about a mission you just completed – and after you select your next mission, you walk yourself back down to the hangar bay. You stand on an elevator and engage in idle chitchat – it's reminiscent of Mass Effect's elevators, in that it's tedious and it's obviously hiding a loading screen behind the scenes. Continues"
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	 Io Interactive’s episodic Hitman experiment is over – or at least, the first season is anyhow. The end result has been slightly uneven (the season began with a strong pair of missions but subsequent episodes were never quite able to match them) but Io has managed to wrap up proceedings on a very positive note. Hitman Episode 6: Hokkaido has 47 flexing every one of his murderous muscles, and it’s easily the best ep since April’s terrific Sapienza mission.  Hokkaido’s remote mountaintop private hospital is a labyrinth of luxurious patient quarters, service areas, and high-tech medical facilities, and it feels a lot bigger on the inside than it looks from the outside. It’s an interesting, atmospheric, and layered map, and a huge step up from last month’s one-note Colorado militia compound.  It’s an interesting, atmospheric, and layered map Outside, where the building itself clings to the mountain, there’s heavy snow, rocky perches, and a grand view. Fireworks pop and paper lanterns drift over the distant town in the valley below, which the hospital’s cable car stretches over. Inside, the place is a fusion of a distinctly Japanese luxury hotel and ice-white operating theatres and observation rooms. Different zones are divided by security doors linked to ID tags embedded in clothing, and this places a big focus on finding the right disguises to suit your planned approach. In an added twist 47 can’t take anything with him into this mission, so any weapons or equipment you want to use will have to be procured on-site. This made total sense to me initially, as 47’s default way into the hospital is under an assumed identity as a new patient, but became a bit of an arbitrary and pointless hurdle later on, once I’d unlocked other mission starting positions. If I’m planning to sneak 47 into the building from the hiking trail, dressed as a ninja, I don’t know why he can’t carry a few coins or a lockpick.  There are two targets in Hokkaido: ICA turncoat Eric Soders and a Japanese lawyer set to make public a list of current ICA operatives around the world. The lawyer is much like any number of targets over the past six months and can be liquidated in a variety of familiar ways, but 47’s final victim of 2016 presents a fresh and welcome challenge. The mission begins with Soders undergoing a heart transplant and thus he never leaves the operating table.  47’s final victim of 2016 presents a fresh and welcome challenge It creates a new and interesting predicament. The target is very much a sitting duck – he can’t run and he can’t hide – but he’s not especially easy to access. There are, of course, ways of ensuring he doesn’t leave the operating theatre alive without ever actually going near him. (One of them is especially… heartless.) A warning, though: stow any expectations that the final episode of this season will offer much in the way of closure for Hitman’s story to date as it does little more than set up seasons to come. It really is quite tough to get truly invested in the intrigue Io has been trying to establish here; it’s just too fractured. Hitman Episode 6: Hokkaido is one of the best levels this season and a great mission to end the year on. The map itself is very good, the atmosphere is excellent, and the hits are challenging. Tricky and more than a little James Bond-esque (the snowed-in private clinic has a real SPECTRE / On Her Majesty’s Secret Service vibe to it), Hokkaido is vintage Hitman at its most creative.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	 Rigid and coarse, Ralof's hair looks like a piece of dust-caked banana Laffy Taffy I once found under my couch. It's the first thing I saw in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim Special Edition as we rode in the cart toward our execution, and it didn't leave the best first impression. But soon after I'd spy rich foliage carpeting the floors of dark fir forests and light bouncing off choppy waters on Lake Ilinalta, and these sights would kindle a homesickness for this made-up world I explored for months five years ago, but the inconsistency of the graphics upgrade leaves Skyrim in a strange place. The Nordic homeland looks better here, no doubt, but never quite good enough to let it pass for a modern game, and it lacks any new content or behind-the-scenes features to make it feel fresh for a returning adventurer. Much as the prophets over at Bethesda Game Studios foretold, the Dragonborn has returned to us, but it's certainly not the second coming. Skyrim's Special Edition recaptures and beautifies the original game, but leaves a lot of room for an even-more-special edition down the road. [Editor's note: This review covers the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions. For the PC version, see our Skyrim Special Edition PC review.] I spent the vast majority of my time with the PS4 version of Skyrim Special Edition, because who could forget how the PS3’s 2011 version suffered from muddy graphics, load times so long I could write and shoot off important emails before the next map appeared, and major frame rate issues that became worse as the size of your save increased? For any other PS3 owner who lived through that, this version is special indeed: load times while fast-traveling now breeze by in about the time it takes to recite the infamous line about taking an arrow to the knee, and for all my sourness over Ralof's taffy hair, it's never looked better on consoles. It's also complete, in that it includes the substantial Dawnguard, Heathfire, and Dragonborn DLC expansions.   The Special Edition doesn't make sweeping character model and animation overhauls. I struggled with this realization at first: in my memory, it always looked much like this, with the woods around Riften alive with detailed vegetation. (I've also spent almost all of my roughly 400 hours with Skyrim on PC, where naturally I stuffed it with graphical enhancements.) But a side-by-side comparison with the original version quickly unmasks the considerable differences. The Special Edition doesn't go for sweeping character model and animation overhauls like I and many other players had hoped, but it does enhance the world’s occasionally meaningful details. The star in this regard is the volumetric lighting, which managed to leave me in awe all these years later as I stalked through Falkreath forests where moonlight dropped in ghostly shafts through the trees. Then there are the new dynamic depth-of-field options, which add some subtle focus to conversations (and which the Special Edition introduces with over-the-top intensity in the opening dragon attack). Textures are improved as well, with generally sharper detail everywhere you look. I personally never had much of a problem with 2011 Skyrim's grim color palette — I found it well-suited to the northern setting and story — but I can't deny that I admire the way the improved color saturation adds a striking intensity to sunny days around Whiterun, which is further improved by greater draw distances. PC mods have allowed these kinds of things for years, of course, but the enhancements here deliver the version of Skyrim the PlayStation and Xbox always deserved. They're certainly not significant enough to warrant a second purchase for the graphics alone, but they're enough to elevate this into the best entry point for new console players.  What’s disappointing is that Bethesda chose to use to the power of the current consoles to make Skyrim look prettier at the expense of making it run better. Special Edition maintains a fairly smooth frame rate around the 30-per-second mark with occasional dips, but never approaches the 60 frames per second you’d hope for in a remastering of a previous-generation game.  Some of the simplest improvements bring the most convenience. The Special Edition’s best improvements, though, deal with the little things — mitigating the myriad annoyances that sometimes made the original a chore to play. You'll see those faster load times, for one, but there's also a handy new quicksave. These features combine to move the story and action along at a faster pace than we saw at the beginning of the decade. Plus, you no longer have to sift through each save file to figure out which one belongs to each character, as the Special Edition takes a welcome cue from Fallout 4 and sorts them by character. Some of the simplest improvements bring the most convenience, such as the ability to auto-run across the tundra with a single tap.   And yes, mods are great! And yes, there are mods for consoles now. And yes, mods are great! They've helped keep the PC version high on Steam's most-played list for years now, whether through wacky ones that turn dragons into Randy Savage or others that cobble together entirely new areas and even new games based on Skyrim’s frame. You can get a fair taste of that bottomless pit of content with the Xbox One version – not all of it, by any means, but a fair smattering – but the PS4 is more limited. Sony finally allowed Bethesda to implement mods after long negotiations, but only on the condition that they take up minimal space and use only in-game assets, as opposed to doing things like replacing dragons with Thomas the Tank Engine (who, sadly, is not in the default game files). The end result of all this is that, at the time of this writing, the PS4 has a mere 103 mods compared to the 254 available for the Xbox One. They're also simpler, with some of the more exciting ones amounting to little more than streetlamps and additional signs along roads. At least some still let PS4 players partake in the grand modder's tradition of cheating if you wish, as in the case of a ring that grants almost unlimited carrying power or a chest stuffed with all the available crafting components. And underneath all of these improvements is a game that remains one of the finest RPGs ever made. (Go back in time and read our review of the original version of Skyrim here.) True, Skyrim's combat remains relatively simplistic and AI interactions are prone to unintentional comedy when NPCs end up making you listen to a cleaning lady sigh about her problems in one ear while gruff jarls shout out history-making pronouncements in the other. Some bugs remain (and likely always will) although many of them can produce bizarre and unexpected behavior that be dismissed as part of a Bethesda game's charm. The number of bugs of the actual game-breaking variety has been much diminished from what we first saw in 2011. To this day, few other RPGs so perfectly capture the experience of trotting out to the wilderness to carve out adventures with any approach you want to take. The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt may have better stories and better character models, but you're always Geralt. In Skyrim, it's myself I remember going into the forests and into crumbling keeps to forge my destiny. (Now, where’s the Morrowind remaster?) If you’ve never experienced Skyrim, the Special Edition is certainly an adventure you can’t afford to miss. It still includes many of the original version’s bugs, ugly character models, and weak combat animations, but the memorable world benefits hugely from improved lighting and effects. There's also some appeal here if you've played before and want to relive Skyrim with the current generation systems, but you'll be best served by picking up the Xbox One version over the PS4 because of superior mod support. However, there’s no new content on the disc to entice you back if you’ve already played all the DLC, only a new coat of paint.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	 Update: Titanfall 2 has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  When Respawn Entertainment first showed off its concept for Titanfall and hinted at a single- and multiplayer first-person shooter full of acrobatic action and towering robot warriors that could rival Call of Duty, Titanfall 2 is the game that I wanted to play. Respawn has doubled down on its compelling formula of breakneck movement and grandiose scale, tapping the vein of those literal and figurative explosive moments that we brag about afterwards. And this time around, the first game’s lacking single-player component has been addressed with admirable results, offering an engaging trek through a universe that was begging to be fleshed out.   Titanfall 2’s campaign is the tale of rifleman Jack Cooper, who’s unexpectedly given the reins of Vanguard-class titan BT-7274 (AKA “BT”) when the two are stranded on the planet Typhon after their starship was brought down in an ambush by the evil mega-corp IMC. Their pairing is a good one, if somewhat predictable, with both characters playing off one another in the fashion of their archetypes. BT’s artificial intelligence personality is dry, logical, and ready to misunderstand Jack’s human colloquialisms and turns-of-phrase for slight comedic effect, while Jack is the relatable everyman grunt who knows next to nothing about being a pilot, much less a hero. Though their dynamic doesn’t quite reach the level of witty buddy-comedy quips and playful banter that some of the dialogue options strive for, what does come across is a genuine mutual respect and, in time, caring that these two find for one another.   Nine chapters of excellent level design showcase Respawn’s genuine talent. This sets the stage for the pair to work together through nine chapters of excellent level design that showcases Respawn’s genuine talent for conveying scale. Each chapter is a sprawling playground of twisting jungle valleys, massive factories, military structures, and debris fields, each seeped in their own dense atmosphere thanks to gorgeous vistas and dramatic lighting. Playing through the approximately six-hour campaign I was impressed that each level felt big enough for me to sprint, hurdle, double-jump, and wall-run through while also being well enough organized that I never felt lost. It’s linear, but open enough to create an illusion of freedom. Only occasionally was I forced to stop and consult the objective beacon, which is great considering the amount of time I spent dashing through mazes of massive air ducts or across assembly lines big enough to construct entire buildings.   Typhon’s environments are as much your enemy as the humans and robots. Everywhere I looked I was reminded of my relatively insignificant size. I felt small standing next to a titan and significantly larger when piloting BT, but always dwarfed by the unbelievably large and intricate structures that tower over even your bulky robot. Levels are deftly crafted with both titan and pilot in mind, requiring you to wade through toxic sludge or a cloud of poison while inside the titan until a bottomless chasm or narrow catwalk forces you to hop out and pinball between walls and railings with strings of leaps and dashes in order to clear a path for your companion to follow. In fact, Typhon’s environments are as much your enemy in Titanfall 2 as the humans and robots that bar your progression. Extreme heat, cold, fatal falls, hazardous waste, and deadly electrical discharges are ever-present obstacles that provide a sense of weight to learning and excelling at Titanfall 2’s signature movement abilities.    To Respawn’s credit, the platforming design is as refreshing as any I’ve encountered in a first-person shooter. Throughout the campaign, new mechanics are consistently introduced that range from neat additions to wholly new puzzle elements, like using cranes to move wall-running surfaces into place to create paths. By the end, you’re fully expected to be able to combine them all to get through a series of complex obstacle courses that mix acrobatics and combat. In one late-game on-foot section I was forced to bounce from wall to wall while swapping items midair to power switches that swung the next wall into place for me to land on it. This kind of frantic precision is electrifying when you’re sprinting above the floorless abyss, where poor timing or a missed input of the smooth and intuitive controls means falling to your death.  New mechanics are consistently introduced. And throughout each dense level, swarms of IMC grunts, humanesque elite robots, Typhon’s indigenous fauna, and massive titans all punctuate the platforming with heavy combat encounters. While most of the soldiers and robots serve as cannon fodder with predictable but effective AI, their numbers, explosive ordinance, and well-equipped titans are still lethal if not respected.  Though your impressive on-foot mobility can often allow you to dash through combat areas toward the objective without firing a single shot or stopping to clean up the enemies, doing so would be a disservice. Titanfall 2 is loaded with an enjoyable collection of punchy firearm types, like the powerhouse automatic shotgun and the electric-sphere-firing rocket launcher, most of Titanfall 2’s firearms have a sci-fi flare - culminating in the infamous fire-and-forget accuracy of the smart pistol. When combined with the smooth movement and melee attacks, this varied arsenal offers moments of catharsis and satisfaction when you decimate a room full of enemies without being tagged. Hearing an enemy soldier call out, “Where did he go?” after annihilating his entire squad like a shotgun tornado and disappearing into the rafters with a few precise leaps is next-level empowering.   But when you’re inside your slower and more grounded titan the combat becomes more conventional first-person shooting, though just as impactful thanks to its unusual flexibility. Unlike the multiplayer titans, BT is capable of swapping loadouts on the fly to become a totally different class, equipping unique weapons, abilities, and defensive items just by calling up the menu and selecting what you need at the time. I’d regularly default to the standard machine gun loadout for its versatility, but when a fast, nimble enemy titan took the field, switching to a loadout with heat-seeking rockets and a jetpack is much more effective for connecting shots. When dozens of smaller grunts and robots peppered me with rockets, I’d swap to the napalm-infused Scorch loadout for its area-of-effect destructiveness.  It’s a refreshing change of pace, especially considering each of these loadouts becomes available shortly after defeating a named boss titan – a la Mega Man – lending a sense of earned progression. These bosses are part of a mercenary corp called the Apex Predators, and each sports their own personality and cosmetically unique titan. When you finally square off against one, you’re treated to a brief introductory cinematic which helps to ratchet up the stakes, but I unfortunately found these chapter-punctuating encounters to be underwhelming. On normal difficulty, they regularly only took slightly more effort to bring down than the standard titans of similar chassis I’d fought before. Their personas and rewards are the memorable parts.  BT’s versatility allows you to use several of the titan chassis from multiplayer. The advantage of BT’s versatility for the story is that it allows you to use several of the titan chassis from multiplayer without without having to swap out titans, keeping the focus squarely on BT and his relationship with Jack. At times, though, it seemed too convenient: BT is so knowledgeable and capable that at some points I had to wonder why this powerful and seemingly self-sufficient titan needs a pilot in the first place. He nearly always has the answer to any question Jack poses, points him in the right direction when they’re separated, gives him orders and instructions toward the next objective, and explains what’s happening no matter the heady sci-fi circumstance.  Ultimately the relationship does find its footing as the two grow more dependant on each other, especially as the plot ramps up sharply in the third act’s enjoyable climax. As both characters begin to buckle under the weight of their situation that relationship begins to take on new meaning, and it becomes one of Titanfall 2’s highlights.  Jack and BT's relationship becomes one of Titanfall 2’s highlights. While I thoroughly enjoyed Titanfall 2’s story, its secretive plot twists and character drama probably wouldn’t sustain me on another playthrough alone. However, with four total difficulty settings (two more above the default ‘normal’ setting I experienced), combined with its welcomingly brisk runtime, I’m definitely interested in going back to see if my mobility skills are enough to keep me alive with the odds stacked against me. And to hunt down those collectibles that are placed so tantalizingly out of reach.
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	 Battlefield’s formula for large-scale, objective-driven warfare is as intense and theatrical as ever against the haunting, archaic backdrop of World War I. Battlefield 1’s single-player campaign is a short but pleasantly surprising anthology of small, human stories that does a good job spotlighting some of the key technology of the era. But it’s the exhilarating multiplayer that most strongly capitalizes on the potential of this old-school arsenal, bringing a number of subtle changes that keep the combat balanced and smart while still allowing for the hallmark chaos that makes Battlefield such a fantastic first-person shooter series.  The Battlefield series has not been known for the quality of its single-player in recent years, so Battlefield 1’s campaign is a nice change of pace. The way each story juggles charm and tragedy in equal measure helps humanize the war and the people that fought it with quiet, welcome restraint. Overly simplistic objectives hold it back from being the memorable saga it could be, but a strong sampling of some of Battlefield’s most defining elements — like objective capturing and vehicular warfare — make it, at the least, a worthy primer for multiplayer.  Battlefield 1's single-player is more interested in telling the human stories of WWI. Rather than restricting itself to one time, place, and character, Battlefield 1’s vignette-style approach to single-player allows it to touch on under-explored theatres of war that made up the nightmarish global campaign of World War I. Its short prologue and five “war stories,” each lasting about 30 minutes to an hour, took me on a harrowing journey from the bleak, muddy fields of the Western front to the sun-baked deserts of North Africa. Because of the wide leaps in both geography and chronology, the campaign never delves too deeply into the political complexities of The Great War. But interesting storytelling prevents it from feeling superficial — these vignettes are more interested in telling the human stories of World War I than delivering a bombastic history lesson, and they do so with mostly effective power and grace.  Storm of Steel, the prologue mission, sets this up with a tragic honesty. You take on the role of several members of the US 369th Infantry, an all-black regiment known as the Harlem Hellfighters. I was happy to see the historic importance of these soldiers, mostly made up of African-American and Puerto Rican-American men, recognized so early on, but I would have preferred to see their rarely-told tale saved for a full, character-driven mission.  Captures the grit and valor of battle without being disingenuous. As you and your fellow Hellfighters desperately try to push back the incoming German forces, you’ll meet death time and time again, but it won’t necessarily be your fault. Sometimes death is awkwardly forced upon you if you end up surviving longer than the script expects, because death is part of the plan. At least it’s handled poignantly. While Storm of Steel effectively works as a way to introduce you to some Battlefield basics — how to shoot, reposition, and reload — its grim reminders of World War I’s overwhelming death toll establishes the tragic tone. This is a sad campaign — perhaps not quite the horror game that the devastation of the Great War deserves, but still one that confidently forgoes the patriotic pomp and war fetishization seen in most modern military shooters. That’s not to say there isn’t excitement or heroism — there is. But Battlefield 1 manages to capture the grit and valor of battle without being disingenuous. Each war story is grand in its smallness.   The first story-driven mission, Through Mud and Blood, is by far the weakest when it comes to character, and the huge jump in quality that follows makes me wonder why DICE kept this one as the opening to begin with. The answer is probably familiarity — you play as Daniel Edwards, a young, inexperienced soldier part of a British Mark V tank unit pushing through German lines into Cambrai, France. It’s not that the story is bad, but Edwards is painfully bland, as is his mission. Capturing points along the way to Cambrai serves as an easy primer for one of Battlefield’s most popular multiplayer modes, Conquest, as well as a how-to on operating tanks, but offers little else in the way of storytelling opportunities.  Edwards makes a cliche leap from a rookie struggling to operate the clunky Mark V to a one-man army who ends up bearing the brunt of his tank unit’s mission: going on foot to scout out enemy encampments, battling enemy infantry and FT-17s while his tank, Black Bess, demands repair, and finally holding out against waves of enemy vehicles in a wrecked trainyard. Not that the slow heaviness of the tanks isn’t fun — that last section in the trainyard is actually the first mission’s high point. It’s a thrilling battle that had me desperately weaving my clunky Mark V in and out of cover, hopping out to repair with a wrench (a quicker, but consequently riskier alternative to repairing from inside), and swerving around my opponents to get a better shot of their tanks’ less-armored rears.  But perhaps more disappointing than this first mission’s story is its bugginess, something that was thankfully absent from the rest of the campaign. My first time through, I spent 15 minutes running around an empty battleground attempting to trigger whatever event would move me on to the next scene. Eventually I realized that an enemy tank had gotten stuck on a trench near the edge of the level, halting the mission’s script. Another segment where you control a carrier pigeon should have served as a thoughtful diversion from the horror of war, but thanks to the weird controls, camera, and collision (I clipped straight through a building), it was sadly comical.    A decent series of adventures with a handful of memorable highlights. At first, I thought this bird segment was meant as a way to teach you how to operate biplanes, but that comes later, in the much stronger second level, Friends in High Places, which excels in both gameplay and storytelling. It’s a level that’s full of high points — figuratively and literally. You spend most of your time in the air as a cocky American pilot who has infiltrated the British Royal Flying Corps for his own amusement, and the chance to fly the Bristol F2.A biplane fighter. Flying any of Battlefield 1’s biplanes, in single- and multiplayer, is a freeing experience. They cut through the air smooth as butter and control with ease and precision. As the American troublemaker narrated his escapades with his unsuspecting British co-pilot, I tore through the sky shooting down German aces, leading them full-speed towards barrage blimps before pulling up and watching them crash, while still taking the time to swoop down and bomb the anti-aircraft trucks below.  But Friends in High Places is great even after you bring your biplane down from these exhilarating dogfights and crash land behind enemy lines. I played this on-foot section multiple ways, first stealthing my way through the trenches with satisfying melee-only kills, and then again going in guns-blazing. Each single-player level is large and relatively open enough to give you more than one option for confronting an obstacle, but still tight and focused enough to keep you on track without limiting your freedom. An approach like stealth is made viable by the ability to throw bullet casings to distract enemies, but also by poor AI that makes it extremely easy to just run from point to point undetected.  Each character is fighting for something much smaller than the war itself. As for the guns-blazing approach: ammo is extremely limited but weapon crates are numerous, and you can always grab guns from fallen enemies, too. I found that playing this way was unsurprisingly the best. Battlefield isn’t really built for stealth, and getting the chance to experiment with a wealth of World War I-era weapons (like the newly invented submachine guns or the simple, but effective bolt-action rifles) and changing up my tactics depending on what I could salvage from enemy encampments was a more gratifying experience.  This brief, stealthy trudge through the trenches and then the muddy graveyard of downed Mark V tanks, bodies, mangled trees, and barbed wire that made up this No Man’s Land area was a haunting break from the epic dogfights preceding it, a transition that Battlefield 1 handles with grace. While most military shooters attempt to make some grand statement about war while making the horror of it a fun adventure, Battlefield 1 uses clever storytelling to maintain a balance. Later levels preserve this balance in their own way. Your adventure as an elite Italian soldier braving an enemy fortress to save his brother is recounted with quiet sadness from father to daughter. In the last, and most pleasantly surprising level, you take on the role of a Bedouin rebel as she fights alongside Lawrence of Arabia for freedom from the Ottomans. Each character in each war story is fighting for something much smaller than the war itself, and that shines through most vignettes with a beautiful, sad power.  Overall, Battlefield 1’s single-player campaign is a decent series of adventures with a handful of memorable highlights, but serves mostly as a way to sample some of the vehicles, elite classes, and firearms you’ll be using in the much more interesting multiplayer.

Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	 In the last few years, the WWE 2K series has more or less bucked the iterative trend of the annual sports games it gets some of its DNA from by making risky but ultimately worthwhile changes to its formerly arcade-style formula. By comparison WWE 2K17 feels like more of a fine-tuning year. There are some welcome gameplay tweaks and additions that keep the in-ring action in top form, but while it takes a few small steps forward in some ways it has either remained stationary or slid backward in areas that have needed improvement for a while now. The first and most important thing, above and beyond the minutiae that’s so easy to get caught up in with wrestling games, is whether the actual wrestling feels right. And like last year’s game, 2K17 delivers the goods. It has a weighty, deliberate feel that really sells the power and impact of each open-hand chop and every double-underhook suplex. Developers Yukes and Visual Concepts have steadily added layers of tactical depth in the last few years that reward timing, planning, and decision-making in a way that makes matches fun beyond the simple joy of playing as your favorite wrestler. All of that holds true this year; even more so thanks to a handful of adjustments and additions.  The single most significant improvement is to multi-person matches, which in the past have always been such an awkward mess that I usually avoided them altogether. This year, subtle changes to the default targeting system and a clever new mechanic has changed all of that for me. Manual targeting is now the default targeting method, and 2K17 does a better overall job of making your current target clear. Snappier target-switching helps too, allowing me to reverse an attack from one opponent and then quickly switch targets, whip around, and wail on someone behind me without feeling like I'm mired in mud.   The real gem, though, is the new rollout mechanic. Like last year’s Working Holds, it represents another example of how wrestling’s theatrical elements can be co-opted to enhance gameplay. If you've ever seen a Triple Threat or Fatal 4-Way on TV, you know it isn't three or four wrestlers wailing on each other for 10 minutes. One guy takes a big bump, rolls out of the ring, and takes a breather while lettings the other two put on a show for a while, and that's exactly what this new system enables. Not only does this make these types of matches look and feel more like their real-life counterparts, it also makes them less chaotic and, as a result, a lot more fun.  Particularly high-impact moves have a chance to force a rollout, which starts a meter filling up. At around half way, you get the option to re-enter the fray at partial strength. Choosing whether to come back in sooner with a debuff or later at full strength becomes a key decision down the stretch, often leading to dramatic interventions right as your opponent is about to score that match-winning pinfall or briefcase grab. This exciting back-and-forth cadence has transformed modes I used to ignore into my favorite ways to play WWE 2K17. Rollouts have transformed modes I used to ignore into my favorite ways to play WWE 2K17.  That more or less sums up the net effect of most of this year’s gameplay tweaks: they broaden the range of matches and modes that feel worth playing. The inclusion of backstage brawls and the the ability (finally) to fight in the crowd makes Falls Count Anywhere matches far more novel, seeing as – as the name implies – falls can now literally happen anywhere. Ladder interactions have been expanded and refined, which, along with the new rollout system, makes Ladder and TLC matches much more enjoyable affairs. There aren’t really any new match types, but it almost feels like it thanks to the new life that’s been breathed into so many of the existing ones.   Core gameplay is the most important thing, but it’s not the only thing. So let's address the elephant in the room: there's no 2K Showcase this year, and it kinda hurts, folks. Don't get me wrong, there's still tons of content here to justify a purchase. This isn't about quantity. But 2K Showcase has been the single-player staple mode since it was introduced as the “Attitude Era” mode in 2K13, and for good reason. It's been the perfect mix of historical reverence and fantasy fulfillment, taking full advantage of the many mechanics that make up the combat system.  I know and understand the reasons for this decision, but that doesn't make the absence of 2K’s marquee mode any easier to take. Without it, the role of the self-contained single-player story mode falls to MyCareer, which is just too different to fill the gap effectively. Not everyone wants to put in the work it takes to create a good-looking custom character or the amount of grinding involved to move your career, and the story forward. Moreover, writing a long-form story of your own just isn’t the same as reliving a well-known, exciting one in the way 2K Showcase allowed. There's no 2K Showcase this year, and it kinda hurts, folks.  That isn’t to say MyCareer is so bad, it’s just longer-form and not as polished as the missing mode it now has to live up to for returning fans. There’s certainly an appeal to building a character of your own creation up from nothing to Hall of Fame status, it just takes a lot of empty-feeling repetition to get there. Just like actual WWE undercard rookies, you’ll be locked in dead-end feuds with other jobbers for weeks at a time, fighting them two and three times a week until you’re sick of beating the tar off them. It makes sense that in order for your eventual ascension to feel meaningful you have to struggle and earn it, I just wish there were a more steady sense of progression and variety. It doesn’t help that MyCareer is also probably the most poorly presented element of 2K17, especially in the case of the new player-controlled promos. As mentioned earlier, the developers have generally done a great job of gamifying the performance-based elements of wrestling, but the the way they’ve chosen to implement promos just doesn’t live up to what they’ve done in other areas. Picking what feel like arbitrary, disjointed dialogue snippets and then watching my character awkwardly mime them while I read the full text below feels like something from a generation-old game compared to how well implemented the rest of 2K17’s gameplay is. There’s an attempt at depth here, with different cities having different types of audiences and requiring you to cater your performance to what they like, but there’s nothing indicating which city has what kind of audience or which dialogue options correspond with them, so it just feels like guessing.  The best parts of MyCareer are the optional ones involving Paul Heyman (who gets to voice himself here) and as anyone who watches wrestling knows, the man knows how to work a mic. Despite your character quietly emoting his way through it all, every scene with Heyman felt far more interesting. That makes one wonder why 2K doesn’t leverage the many talented promo-artists of the WWE more fully to create a story mode that fully showcases their personalities. Heyman’s brief standout moments only highlight what an opportunity is being missed here.   While we’re talking about missed opportunities, now that we are a few years into the console cycle the absence of modes that got lost in the hardware transition are starting to get harder to look past. I don’t really care about gimmicky stuff like Buried Alive, but I can’t even do a simple tag-team tables match. How is D-Von supposed to “get the tables,” hmmmmm? Six-person tornado tag TLC’s still aren’t a thing? I get it, there are TONS of modes and features already there, but these are things we used to have and the promise of this franchise has always been an EA Sports-like “if it’s in the game, it’s in the game” approach. So these missing features are tough to ignore. Still, even the best wrestlers don’t nail every single spot, and 2K17 offers so much depth in terms of modes and options that those missteps barely slow it down. The creation suite continues to expand and impress with a surprisingly powerful Adobe Premier-like Titantron video editor, and the most insanely detailed facial morphing I’ve ever seen in a game. 2K17 even provides a generous helping of stock video footage, icon animations and scene transitions, allowing you to make something truly original rather than just a slightly modified version of an existing Superstar’s video. Bringing back the still-missing Create-a-Move and Create-a-Story would have been an ideal complement to this new tool, but hey, there’s always next year. WWE 2K17 doesn’t make any big, drastic changes, but its smart gameplay tweaks have revitalized match types I’d ignored the past few years. I really miss 2K Showcase, and 2K17 is still weak in areas that I feel should have been shored up by now, but its excellent combat, and generous amounts of customization help it retain its title.
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	 This year’s Skylanders sometimes feels like a casino: it’s exciting to look at, easy to consume, obnoxiously loud, and certainly wants to take your money with an excess of microtransactions that kids could easily accidentally click on. But with the addition of a new character-creation menu that’s buffed up with loot and gear of varying rarity, Skylanders Imaginators adds a level of customization, control, and creativity that keeps it feeling fresh. Imaginators is still leading the charge in the toys-to-life genre, with an expansive library of neatly designed toy figures jumping into animated life in your game world as soon as you place them on the included portal. That’s a Skylanders standard, but Imaginators introduces Creation Crystals, which are so appealing to my inner child. I can create my own creature, train it, and then carry it around with me in a little toy crystal – including to friends’ houses to introduce to their Imaginators so that we could fight evil together. I’ve certainly never felt anywhere near so possessive of a Skylander as I did for my Fire Sorcerer, Caerwyn, who I spent the better half of the 10-hour campaign customizing.   Your Imaginator’s powers, weapons, bodies, clothing, catchphrases, and more can all be conveniently be edited and updated at almost any time through a simple menu that manages to neatly hide just how extensive it is. And you’ll have the option to upgrade plenty, since the wearable gear that’s scattered around Skylands is pleasantly common and comes in an appealing variety of designs. You can get an air horn for an ear, a snake for an arm, a chain for a tail and a s’more for a staff, if you want (and I did). Gear really helps to shape your Imaginator to be weird and wonderful, and a color-scheme system forces even the most eclectic bunch of gear to match perfectly, unless you want it to stay mismatched.  Imaginators are weird and wonderful  The catch is that this gear is for sale through microtransactions, and Skylanders Imaginators isn’t shy about advertising that. If you press A or X quickly too many times while opening loot chests after a mission (there are a lot that you have to tediously open one at a time) you’ll find yourself in a store. That’s a little distasteful in a game aimed at kids of all ages. It’s doubly painful that gear can’t be worn by regular Skylanders (including the new toys, called Senseis) at all, meaning any existing collections of toys can’t hold a candle to the appeal of the Creation Crystals. Plus, there’s plenty of extra content that’s locked to Senseis of certain classes and elements, a level cap that only increases as you introduce more Senseis to your game, and encouragement to pay to 3D-print your Imaginators, too. That’s an exciting feature that lets you bring your Imaginator into the real world, but it’s another link in a chain of aggressive up-selling. Oh yeah, there’s an actual game here, too! Skylanders and Imaginators alike still dance across your screen in a flurry of basic hack ’n’ slash combat, with just enough variety for your button mashing to feel purposeful, and just enough upgrades to provide a sense of progression. Movement outside of combat is a little on the sluggish side, however, and I ended up favoring gear that would increase my Imaginator’s speed as a result.   But the health of the significant variety of oddly charming enemy types, including some aggressive sheep dressed as wolves, and a combination of a shark and a tube that’s fittingly called a Tube-Shark, offer a consistent challenge in between the series’ tried-and-true puzzle-platforming. Each level also ends in a boss fight, but aside from the enemies being different battle classes, they follow an overly familiar and unfortunately predictable three-wave combat pattern that, ironically, lacks creativity.  Bizarre mini-games are repeated over and over  While the combat, platforming, and puzzles are all sound, this time the formula is some of the least interesting gameplay we’ve seen out of Skylanders in a while. Where last year’s game turned entire levels into interesting gravity-shifting puzzles, in Imaginators there are a handful of bizarre mini-games repeated over and over within different levels. They usually present you with challenges of grinding on railings, literally chasing snails, unlocking doors, and moving boxes, rather than concepts that are unique to, or complementary to, these admirably beautiful levels.   And it is a wonderfully colorful, beautifully animated game, with a genuinely funny cast of characters who are each brought to life with goofy, but loveable voice acting. The score is seriously moving, too - water levels have a magical, aquatic echo, and the game-show level is as upbeat and cheeky as you’d expect from our oddly adorable returning villain, Kaos. The story that holds that all together is unfortunately bland, but creating the story of your own Imaginator makes up for that in spades.  It is a wonderfully colorful, beautifully animated game  The PS4 version of Imaginators does have some extra value in Crash Bandicoot becoming a Skylander, and playing with Crash also unlocks an incredibly nostalgic, Crash-style level. The voice acting, sound design, and gameplay itself – with Crash running towards the camera and collecting apples while a giant boulder chases after him – is all a great homage.   The Nintendo Switch version of Skylanders Imaginators is the same as those reviewed above in both content and performance, except that it includes minor touch-screen functionality and doesn’t require a portal thanks to the Joy-Con’s built-in NFC reader. The touch screen is only really useful for selecting items in the customization menu, but not for actually customizing them, as the sliders for size and colour don’t work with your fingers. Not having to lug around a portal to play it is incredibly convenient, on the other hand. It’s great to just tap your Skylander on the right thumbstick, like you would with an Amiibo, and have it be recognized by the hardware in a matter of seconds. This is our first chance to play Skylanders (the console version, that is) on the go, and this takes the idea of being able to bring your Imaginators to your friends’ houses to adventure together to a whole new level. On the whole, Skylanders Imaginators is one of the weaker games in the series. It does have a creative element that delighted my inner child with the ability to build and carry around my own crazy character going for it, and the world looks and sounds great. But I was let down by the level design and plot, and soured by the aggressive microtransaction prompts.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	 If you’re looking for a better modern rally game than Dirt Rally, you can stop looking; it doesn’t exist, and WRC 6 hasn’t toppled Codemasters’ off-road opus. But with its robust career mode, well-designed stages, and approachable handling model WRC 6 makes a good case for itself as a credible companion game to the venerable Dirt Rally. It’s not always very pretty, and it can’t really touch its competition in terms of content, but WRC 6 is the most fun I’ve had with an officially licensed WRC game in over a decade.   WRC 6’s strongest feature is its narrow and lengthy stages. The sense of velocity is also terrific because of the cramped, obstacle-lined roads; even modest speeds feel fast when hazards are whipping by in such close proximity to your car. There’s a great variety of stages as they’re spread across all 14 countries from the 2016 World Rally Championship, and there are a number of extremely technical two-car Super Special Stages amongst them (though no rallycross tracks). While there’s not a huge number of stages per country, that’s about twice the amount of locations featured in Dirt Rally. However, WRC 6’s stages are nowhere near as handsome. They also lack pizazz; the water-splash effect in WRC 6, for instance, is an abject anticlimax. Crashing through shallow water should be dramatic, highlight-reel stuff, but in WRC 6 it’s a forgettable effect a generation or two behind the curve. Snow joke, really. WRC 6’s cars seem sharp, well-detailed, and about on par with its peers. They show sufficient visual damage, though some of the scratch effects seem a little low-res when viewed from bonnet cam. Unfortunately there isn’t a huge amount of cars (no iconic classics or retro ’90s rally legends like you’ll find in Dirt Rally or Sébastien Loeb Rally Evo) and this is perhaps the most disappointing aspect of WRC 6. Being limited to just the current crop of strikingly similar-looking hatchbacks is a shame, but at least they feel pretty good behind the wheel. Don’t get me wrong; WRC 6 doesn’t boast sim-like handling as sublime as you’ll find in Dirt Rally, but it does require a little more finesse than a pure arcade rally experience, like Sega Rally, or the RalliSport Challenge games of old. There’s a nice sense of weight to the cars as you grab the handbrake and heft them into tight corners, plus decent distinction between surface types. I’m not a fan of the chase cam, which feels a little too stiff and unwieldy for the fairly grippy handling model, but WRC 6 is still very forgiving, even on its most challenging “simulation” settings. Engine audio is passable (though it’s turned down by default in the menus; I highly recommend cranking it back up), but the sound overall could do with more love. It definitely still lacks the real rasp and throatiness you’d expect from a rally car, and environmental effects don’t contribute much to the overall audio tapestry (for example, kick-up and road noise is way too subtle). There are moments where WRC 6 should be nothing short of deafening, like in the cabin of a high-revving rally car clawing over loose gravel under an extremely low hovering camera chopper, and it just… isn’t. Ready to make like Van Halen? The pacenotes get the job done (and you can choose between simple and more complex instructions) but they’re old-school in implementation; stitched together from a soundboard and a tad robotic, and not a patch on Dirt Rally’s unique pacenotes for each individual stage. They also trip over themselves slightly during multiple rapid corners, but they’re decent enough. Career mode doesn’t innovate but it does a respectable job of putting us in the service park between stages and adding just enough window dressing to ensure our trip from the Junior WRC to the top tier isn’t entirely menu-based. The result falls well short of, say, F1 2016, but it does inject the career campaign with a little more race-day flavour than the admittedly sterile Dirt Rally. WRC 6 reminds me a lot of the PlayStation 2-era Evolution-developed WRC games; it’s an earnest attempt to capture the spirit of a niche motorsport series and, most importantly, it feels good to play thanks to a wide selection of tight-quarters race tracks, and decent handling. It might not hold a candle to Dirt Rally in its car selection or look and feel, but it’s not bad for developer Kylotonn’s sophomore effort on the series. If Milestone’s stint turned you off, as it did me, now could be a good time to get reacquainted.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	 A new director picks up years later where the revered original creator left off. An iconic but now-aged hero plays a prominent role, comforting old fans and tugging on their nostalgic heartstrings for much of the story while passing the torch to a new generation of heroes. The plot structure follows many of the same recognizable beats of the tale that started it all, and by the end you’ve been on a great ride that is both familiar and new at the same time. No, I’m not talking about Star Wars Episode VII, though there are a number of interesting (if coincidental) similarities between it and the approach Microsoft’s taken to its first internally developed Gears of War game. Gears of War 4 is set 25 years after the events of the original trilogy, with Marcus Fenix playing the Han Solo mentor role, while his son JD and JD’s longtime friends Kait and Del sub in for Rey, Finn, and Poe. As the torch is passed to a new generation, I was left reassured that this is in many ways the same Gears I know and love.   The new DeeBee and Swarm enemies require welcome new offensive and defensive strategies to combat them.  Let’s get something out of the way up front: if you’re looking for Gears of War to be completely reinvented, Gears 4 isn’t that game. That full-on reboot day will likely arrive eventually, but everything about this entry in the series hews closest to the first Gears, which is probably the one I’d also choose to emulate: the mystery of a new, unknown enemy lends a survival-horror feel to the gritty shooter tone, the occasional fork in the road offers both gameplay variety and replayability, and the plot revolves around a search for family – here, it’s Kait’s missing mother Reyna Diaz in place of Dominic Santiago’s wife Maria. That’s not to say Gears of War 4 doesn’t bring new elements to the series’ cover-based shooting formula. On the campaign side, the new DeeBee robot enemies and Seran Swarm foes attack differently than their Locust predecessors, thus requiring welcome new offensive and defensive strategies to combat them. For instance, the larger Heavy DeeBee jump-jets over cover and self-destructs when it takes enough damage, while the skybound, front-shielded Guardian is best flanked from multiple sides in order to expose its weak spots. And the Swarm’s Pouncer flings deadly quills from its tail and hops on top of cover, pinning you to the ground like a Hobbes from Hell if you stay in one place for too long. All of these put a lot more pressure on you than ever before in a Gears game, and are especially inviting for challenge-seekers playing on higher difficulty levels.   Variety is a welcome pillar of its eight-hour trek.  On a similar note, Gears of War 4’s new weapons integrate nicely into the established universe alongside the familiar Lancer and Friends, both in campaign and multiplayer. The Buzzkill fires lethal, high-velocity sawblades that spectacularly instagib foes when they connect. The Overkill packs a wicked, if short-range, double-barrel shotgun-esque punch that’s especially gratifying when other human players feel its wrath. Finally, the DeeBees’ EMBAR is a no-scope rifle that’s not nearly as cumbersome to wield as the traditional Longshot. Design-wise, the new Gears campaign succeeds thanks to stellar execution of a focused game plan. Variety is a welcome pillar of its eight-hour trek, as, aside from one exception in Act IV, you’re never in one place doing the same thing for too long. Gears 4’s campaign – playable in two-player split-screen or online co-op (and even supports cross-platform play with the PC version) – packs several gameplay styles, including a few thematically appropriate instances of Horde mode along with a couple other enjoyable changes of pace. (A friendly suggestion: do not watch the Gears of War 4 Launch Trailer; it gives away a few of the campaign’s fun gameplay surprises.) And laudably, Gears 4 never relies on the annoying design trope of requiring you to run a frustrating gauntlet through large groups of the toughest enemies you’ve already fought individually in order to reach its conclusion; it’s got a much smarter endgame up its sleeve.   Gears 4’s most graphically impressive moments are tied to the weather.  Visually, this Gears doesn’t pack the same jaw-dropping punch the original did back in 2006 when it showed the kind of leap forward that the Unreal Engine was capable of, but it is a very pretty game throughout. That’s not because it’s one of the first Xbox games to support HDR if you’ve got an Xbox One S and a capable TV, because while I could tell a difference compared to non-HDR, it’s nothing to write home about. Gears 4’s most graphically impressive moments are tied to the weather, with Windflares (basically giant electrical dust storms) producing swirling dust, swaying trees, and dancing foliage. Smartly, the heavy winds actually affect weapons that fire relatively slow-moving projectiles such as the aforementioned Buzzkill, whose shots will arc such that they become almost useless at their normally reliable medium range, forcing you to choose your gear extra carefully in the inclement weather. Like its fellow first-party mainstay Halo, Gears of War’s campaign has always been complemented by great multiplayer. That hasn’t changed with Gears of War 4. Both Versus and Horde, like campaign, have evolved rather than been reinvented, with predictably fun results. Gears multiplayer has always managed a brilliant balance of tactics and fast action to go with its borderline-cartoonish violence, giving it standout appeal over the glut of other multiplayer shooters. Gears 4 brings 10 maps and plenty of modes – most of which are great, tried-and-true staples from other games or previous Gears entries. A standout is Arms Race, which is basically Call of Duty’s Gun Game, in which each team in a races to get three kills each with every weapon in a certain order. It works just as well here. Escalation, aka Domination or Territories, on the other hand, simply drags on far too long as a best-of-13-round duel. If Gears 4 were patched to cut that in half, Escalation would join the other modes in the winner’s circle. Meanwhile, the now-expected private-match customizability also grants Versus plenty of staying power to play exactly how you want.  The five-player Horde mode, however, is once again where Gears’ multiplayer shines brightest. The tower-defense elements introduced in Gears 3 have been iterated on for the better here. Killed enemies drop resource chits that must be collected and brought back to your Fabricator – your mobile emplacement builder, basically – and deposited into a team-shared pool used to erect fences, sentries, turrets, and more as you fight through 50 waves of DeeBee and Swarm foes. Every tenth wave brings out a random boss to contend with, such as the Snatcher, who steals downed allies and carries them away, or the Kestrel, an attack helicopter who forces you to change your eye level. And a new class system emphasizes teamwork by encouraging specialized roles that grant specific action bonuses. For example, the Engineer is more lightly armed but can repair damaged emplacements. My group’s best run ended at wave 42, and we immediately jumped back in for more. So expect many hours of replayable fun with your friends.   After spending time with the PC version (included free with digital purchase of the Xbox One version, and vice versa), I'm happy to report that performance is buttery smooth – my GTX 970-powered PC never dipped below 60fps, and it would've been consistently higher if not for the refresh-rate limitations of my aging monitor. Keyboard-and-mouse controls feel great and are as configurable as you'd expect from a PC game, with only the default binding of the gamepad's A-button functionality set to the spacebar annoying me enough to want to re-bind it to the left shift key. Cross-play is completely seamless – I played Horde on Xbox One with two PC teammates (marked as such by a monitor icon next to their gamertag in the lobby) and two console teammates, and both progress and achievements carry over to either version. Aside from 4K resolution, which I wasn't able to test, the PC version's biggest draw is a 60fps campaign, which is capped at 30fps on the Xbox One. It's not a problem at all on console, but it's noticeably smoother on a capable PC. I never expected to compare Gears of War 4 to The Force Awakens, but I couldn’t be happier to do so. Like the latest chapter in the story from a time long ago in a galaxy far, far away, Gears of War 4 is directed by a new generation of creators, shares a lot of similar narrative structures to the beloved first piece of the trilogy it succeeds, and is an experience you’ll walk away from with a big smile on your face – in campaign, Versus, and Horde modes alike. It’s about as good of a franchise reawakening as I could’ve hoped for. J.J. Abrams would no doubt appreciate what Gears 4 accomplishes.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	 My 30 hours with Mafia 3 were filled with fantastic highs and baffling lows. Its writing and performances are some of the best of this entire generation, and it isn’t pulling punches with the themes it tackles. But the minute-to-minute gameplay between the story segments rarely broke the open-world mold, and it recycled its few tricks far too often. Lincoln Clay’s story could’ve unfolded as a cliche tale of revenge, but developer Hangar 13 dove past the superficial level to deliver a story rife with social commentary on post-Vietnam America and filled it with three-dimensional characters who I’ve grown to either genuinely care about or really want to see dead. I loved the way the story hops between the events you play, a deposition centered around the ramifications of your actions, and a faux-documentary where the incredibly well written and acted Father James talks about his time with Lincoln.  New Bordeaux, a fictionalized take on New Orleans in 1968, is full of diverse architecture and nature. From Mardi Gras parades and above-ground cemeteries to bayous filled with gators and riverboat gambling tours, it took me to some settings I can’t recall ever exploring in a video game before. Along with this are some pretty heavy themes consistent with the era: Mafia 3 does not shy away from dealing with racism and what America was like in the fallout of the Vietnam War, but all of it is done smartly with tact and in ways that affect gameplay. For example, if you steal a car in an affluent neighborhood, cops will show up quickly and in full force. Steal a car in a poor neighborhood, and the cops might not even show up at all. All of this is only heightened by the fantastic soundtrack, which does as good of a job at delivering a sense of time and place as Grand Theft Auto: Vice City did for the ‘80s. The Rolling Stones, Sam Cooke, and Creedence Clearwater Revival all add to Mafia’s already incredible atmosphere.     In between the chunks of plot is the familiar open-world infrastructure that Grand Theft Auto 3 set in place 15 years ago. You drive around New Bordeaux, get missions from various characters, reap your rewards, and occasionally get sidetracked along the way. I really love the big, story-driven missions set in unique, well-designed locations. Making my way through a creepy abandoned amusement park, escaping a bank vault after a heist, and sneaking aboard a sinking riverboat all provided some awesome, memorable action. That being said, the path to these big encounters isn’t nearly as exciting. Taking over parts of the city involves repeating the same handful of tasks like simple assassinations, destroying some sort of cargo, or stealing something from a well-guarded compound. The first time I did each one of these was great; the literal 20th time, not so much. What’s even worse is that a lot of locations are used as the setting for multiple missions, meaning I had to clear out the exact same bath house filled with enemies twice in a row, which is pretty nonsensical.   Even that wouldn't be a big deal if Mafia 3’s combat were interesting enough to make each encounter feel different, but instead it definitely falls into the realm of “familiar, but functional.” The cover system is adequate when it works, but it occasionally wonked out and wouldn’t let me hide behind something, which led to a handful of frustrating deaths. And while there’s a standard array of weapons at your disposal, I’ve found that the most useful ways to kill enemies are whistling to get their attention while I’m in stealth and silently stabbing them or just using my basic pistol. Enemies don’t really get any stronger or learn any new tricks as you progress, so my tactics in hour two were pretty much the same as they were in hour 20. Also, the enemy AI lacks any sense of self-preservation, so many missions just turned into bland shooting galleries in forgettable locations. At least the consequences of all of these raids play out in a super cool way in Mafia 3’s lieutenant system. Once you own a neighborhood you assign it to one of your three partners, which gives you new abilities and weapons specific to your choice. However, if you neglect one of them enough they’ll turn on you. This led to some genuinely tough decisions, and even impacted how the ending of my game played out. I really dug having to balance wanting to help out Cassandra as a character with the desire to get Vito’s health perks. While the upgrades aren’t really different enough to get me to play through again, the story changes that come directly from my decisions were hugely varied (I viewed the alternate paths on YouTube) and lend to a sense that your actions actually do matter.     While Mafia 3's design generally checks all of the GTA-style boxes, it completely drops the ball on certain features that are all but ubiquitous in open-world games of 2016. For example, it doesn’t allow you to fast travel at all, which became a hassle when I had to drive across the map to an objective that took only a few seconds to complete, only to find myself having to drive all the way back across New Bordeaux to continue with the story. Considering the designers knew there would be no fast travel option, it's confounding that they'd create missions like this at all. The driving definitely isn’t bad -- it errs on the fast and loose arcade side, which I appreciate more than a rigid simulation because it lends itself to more dramatic crashes-- but having to trek back and forth across the same stretches of Louisiana became a slog by the end. Some of this pain is alleviated in other ways. For example, you can call in favors that take care of menial tasks like storing your money so that you don’t lose it if you die, delivering you a fresh car, or hailing a mobile arms dealer to meet you wherever you want. Mafia 3 isn’t the first game to do this, but it’s a much-appreciated feature that should become standard across the board.   However, despite loving the setting in terms of the story, the open world of Mafia 3 definitely feels a bit barren because there isn't that much to do. Collectables like Playboy covers and albums from the era are scattered around, but there really isn’t any gameplay incentive to find them other than completionism. Couple this with the lack of interesting sidequests, and Mafia 3 is best played mainlining the story without many detours. Finally, while there’s been a lot of talk online of Mafia 3 being full of glitches and bugs (some of which we even rounded up ourselves) I didn’t encounter anything remotely resembling some of these during 30 hours on the Xbox One version, and none of the IGN staff playing the PS4 or PC versions have reported personally coming across anything major either. Obviously the bugs exist, but they aren't happening to everybody. That said, it did hard crash four times throughout my playthrough, though thankfully I never lost any progress because it loaded me right back where I was. Also, there were several instances where the frame rate (which usually does a good job of maintaining 30) stuttered and froze for a few seconds before resuming.    The visuals in Mafia 3 aren’t going to blow any PC enthusiast’s CUDA cores off. I used Nvidia’s recommended settings for my GTX 770 (with a couple tweaks, like enabling Vsync), which let me crank up just about everything but anti-aliasing. A lot of the environmental textures are muddy and flat on close inspection, and don’t seem to make use of tessellation or other PC staple features of the latest DirectX versions. And most of the actors have a bad case of Plastic Ken Doll Helmet Hair. Fortunately, while it might not be the prettiest game around, it runs pretty smoothly in most situations. After enabling the post-launch 60fps patch I was able to easily stay at a stable 60 when indoors no matter what was happening. Cruising around under the open sky I was usually bouncing between the mid-30s and mid-40s, with occasional drops into the 20s during cutscenes and moments of heavy action. The reflections and shadows also look great, even when I tried out some of the lower graphical settings to see if I could get a more stable framerate outdoors (which met with moderate success, though cutscenes were still an issue). All the options you’d expect to be able to tweak in a major PC release are present and accounted for, including adjustable FOV up to 90 degrees.   The same control problem that has plagued every GTA-style game on the PC is apparent in Mafia 3: Handling a vehicle with WASD and no analog acceleration control is a nightmare, but for a dedicated PC shooter player, aiming a gun with the thumbsticks is as frustrating and imprecise as it is sacrilegious. Luckily, most notables of the genre since GTA 4 have implemented the ability to switch on the fly between mouse/keyboard and gamepad without having to futz around in the options menu, and Mafia 3 is no exception. It was relatively painless to pick up my trusty 360 controller when I got behind the wheel of something fast, relying on more traditional PC controls when on foot. The on-screen button prompts even adjust to the last input method used with no lag, which is always a nice touch. The menus are definitely not designed with the mouse and keyboard in mind. They’re not very responsive to mouse input and behave awkwardly if you try to navigate quickly between tabs with the cursor, similar to Skyrim’s default UI. It’s almost easier to use the gamepad any time you’re in the menus. This became especially frustrating any time I had to interact with the map screen to figure out where I was and select objectives. It’s usable, but far from comfortable. The default mouse sensitivity is also absurdly high, but that’s easily adjustable. And while the interface might not have been a joy to work with, Mafia 3 is extremely Alt + Tab friendly. I didn’t have any issues putting it on hold to check email, nor did it self-destruct when I returned after leaving it running in the background for a while. Mafia 3’s strong characters and confident storytelling kept me engaged, even if the gameplay rarely delivered anything but bog-standard and repetitive open-world action. That’s a bummer, because Lincoln is an incredible protagonist and New Bordeaux is a fantastic setting thematically, and it would’ve been great to see them put to better use.
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	 Thumper is one of those game that stays in your head long after you’ve put it down. It’s a horror game disguised as rhythm action, a high-speed trip through an abstract hell full of imaginative cosmic entities and set to the beat of a sinister orchestral score. Its surprisingly sophisticated one-button control scheme makes it invitingly accessible while still allowing for a ton of tricky, precision-based maneuvers, and it’s all executed with intense physical brutality and speed that adds an exhilarating violence to your every action. Thumper manages to do a lot with very little input, making it both extremely easy to pick up and difficult to master. This is a tempting combination that demands replaying, in part because of how nuanced the rhythm-based gameplay becomes later on. The first level does a fine job introducing you to the most basic mechanics, which lay the groundwork for the gradually intensifying and increasingly interesting layers of obstacles that build up over each of its nine stages.  Using a DualShock 4, you tap X to make your little chrome space beetle press, or “thump,” glowing rectangles on the track, spaced out based on very specific beats to make them easier and more catchy to hit. Holding down X lets you speed through dangerous red bars unscathed, which make a satisfying clunk as you barrel into them, while holding X and using the left analog stick to hold left or right lets you survive turns. Both obstacles make a distinct sound shortly before they appear, giving you some much-needed forewarning. The fact that obstacles sometimes show up so last-second makes each course that much more thrilling, but the sound cues keep it fair.  In many ways, Thumper is basically a horror game. Missing turns or crashing into obvious obstacles like the red bars shatter the protective outer shell of your beetle in a loud, violent storm of flying metal that often clutters up the screen, making it difficult to see what’s coming next. Two hits and you’re dead, but with the frequency of checkpoints in each level, this is a generous amount of health. While it didn’t happen often, there were times when I was going so fast and the track gave such little indication of upcoming obstacles that getting hit once doomed me into an inevitable second crash because of the on-screen distraction. This was annoying when it happened, but I can’t deny the exhilaration of Thumper’s devastating physical brutality — a quality that is, however, portrayed much more reasonably in its jarring last-second turns, or the pounding shockwaves you can learn to send out for bonus points.  Thumper has many of these nuanced mechanics, which make its simple one-button approach much more sophisticated than you’d think at a glance. For turns, you can hold X as far ahead of the bend as you want to, but holding left or right with the analog stick at just the right moment earns you extra points for a “perfect turn.” While taking turns in mid-air will break your flight, nailing a perfect turn keeps you in the air and lets you collect otherwise-impossible rings. The list goes on and on.  Thumper emulates the satisfaction of playing a musical instrument. You don’t need to know most of this to complete the full game, which keeps Thumper accessible to players of all skill levels without requiring any adjustable difficulty settings. Doing the bare minimum of avoiding dangerous obstacles will get you through all nine levels just fine, but if you want to move up from the low C to a B, A, and finally S rank, you need to learn the nuances. This invites replayability, and even after running through several levels for the third or fourth time, I’m still finding small new ways to milk more points from each track. It’s nice to see my name climbing up the as-of-now scantily populated leaderboards, but the most rewarding part is the sheer satisfaction of executing each beat in a sequence and hearing the way my movements perfectly match the beat of the music. As a rhythm game, Thumper is all about the music, but it’s the little reactive noises here and there that make up the bulk of its captivating audio experience. Everything in Thumper has smart sound cues that indicate whether you’ve done something right: a deep, bassy thump when you land beats, a bright creak when you bank a perfect turn, multiple clunks increasing in pitch with each red bar you destroy.  Sound cues become necessary to the beat in smart ways. Once things really start ramping up past the tutorial-heavy first level and mechanics like jumping over spikes, flying to collect rings, and switching lanes are introduced (all also conveniently done with some easy combination of X and the left analog stick), these sound cues become more than just rewarding signals of a job well done — they become necessary to the beat. Against the musical backdrop of Thumper’s dramatic war drums, industrial noise, and orchestral wailings are the thumps and clunks and creaks of my actions, punctuating the score and adding a separate, but unifying melody. At its speediest and most intense peaks, I found that Thumper emulated the satisfaction of playing a musical instrument as I rapidly hit and held notes to the beat of its haunting music. This level of intensity and precision culminates most strongly during Thumper’s many visually stunning and challenging boss fights. Most of the nine levels have one mini-boss and one recurring final boss, a burning red skull who grows gradually more horrifying and malformed with every appearance — and it’s huge in VR. In many ways, Thumper is basically a horror game.  Thumper’s bosses represent the height of its bizarre imagery. To fight bosses, you need to perfectly hit increasingly demanding sequences of glowing green thumps on the track, ending in one glowing thump that sends out a devastating wave of energy to attack the enemy. Missing one beat forces you to play through the sequence without the final “attack thump,” then resets the loop once it reaches the start so you can try again. Punishing you with repetition is actually a nice tradeoff because it lets you practice the sequence even when you mess up. Bosses go down in about four hits, but the difficulty of the sequences that couch each “attack thump” gets tougher and tougher with each level. Watching the boss finally explode in a flurry of flying bone, steel, and whatever else they’re made of is a fine reward for your efforts. Thumper’s bosses also represent the height of its bizarre imagery, ranging from massive, cosmic geometric shapes that pulse to the beat of the music to sinister aquatic demons. The most frightening boss I went up against was an ethereal being that looked like a sinister cross between a jellyfish and a centipede. Its menacing size and eel-like movements dominated my field of view as it loomed overhead and stretched into the distance, making it one of the more terrifying monstrosities to witness in VR. I also fought a devilish starfish that seemed to be made out of galaxies, and — another favorite — an unsettlingly massive machine that sped along the track in front of me, whipping around curves with an uncanny agility and barreling impossible tunnels into thin air.  There’s an otherworldly dread in Thumper’s strange world. The fusion of metallic materials like chrome and steel with the writhing organic tentacles that often adorn the track creates a techno-horror nightmare realm unlike anything I’ve ever seen. If I had to compare Thumper’s trippy holographic light tunnels and swirling backdrop to one thing, it would be the warp sequence from 2001: A Space Odyssey. There’s a bizarre, otherworldly dread in Thumper’s strange world, like you’ve reached the edge of the universe and are seeing things you shouldn’t be. The weight and mystery of that void is so much more apparent in VR, where you can freely look around at the billowing colors in the distance, or to the side at the eerie, synchronized thrashing of the limbs sprouting from the track. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. There is a disappointing lack of visual variation to distinguish levels from each other beyond speed and mechanics, and sometimes sights, like the tentacles that surround the track or the interior of a sci-fi looking tunnel disappear too soon into your periphery. Considering how awesome and huge and weird everything looks in VR, it would’ve been nice to have the option to look back and see things disappear into the distance to create the illusion that I was surrounded by the abyss rather than just plummeting straight at it. But I rarely felt the need to scrutinize my surroundings beyond what I could take in during its high-speed action anyway, especially since the sights in front of you are always powerful enough as it is. Each level contains a few much-needed interludes, which provide a temporary respite from the breakneck action and gave me the chance to get a closer look at my unnatural surroundings without risking a crash.   The Switch version of Thumper looks and runs the same as it does on PlayStation 4 and PC, at the same smooth 60 fps. It runs at 1080p on a TV and 720p in portable mode, but it still looks fantastic on the handheld display. Like 1-2-Switch and Graceful Explosion Machine, Thumper uses the Switch’s HD Rumble feature to add a subtle texture to the physical feedback. It really feels like you’re scraping against the edges of the track and slamming into its sharp turns, which adds to the physical brutality that makes Thumper so distinct. Thumper’s brutal, breakneck speed and precision-based musical action kept me entranced for all nine of its bizarre, nightmarish stages, which contained enough nuanced high score-chasing tricks to demand several replays already. To really master Thumper’s many layers of rhythm-based mechanisms would take much more time than the 10 or so hours it takes to complete the first time – and that’s a challenge that I eagerly accept. Menacing boss fights that manage to stay interesting despite a relatively linear structure and a strange, chrome-plated brand of cosmic horror that’s as fascinating as it is frightening make repeat trips easy and exciting. But it’s the music and sounds of Thumper that will stick with me the most, beckoning me back to that terrifying abyss for several more hours to come.
Kallie Plagge	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	 In a lot of ways, Destiny: Rise of Iron is more of the same. When it does the Destiny formula well, it’s polished with challenging combat and plenty for a veteran Guardian to do. A lot of the time, though, it falls into the same trap Destiny’s always been susceptible to and turns into a seemingly endless, repetitive grind. It often feels empty, even with a challenging and satisfying raid dangling as a big incentive. The new two-or-so-hour campaign is emblematic of how Rise of Iron as a whole stacks up. It definitely brings more of what I already like about Destiny, like taking on waves of spongy enemies in a series of fights that are all about your positioning in the area, but it does little to improve upon Destiny’s strengths or fix its problems. The difficulty mostly comes from a mysterious, virus-like nanotechnology called SIVA enhancing the power of the Fallen, which obviously makes them harder to kill. The campaign relies heavily on the buffed Fallen to be challenging rather than doing anything we haven’t seen from Destiny before.   You kill a wave of Fallen, move to another room, and kill another wave of Fallen. Destiny’s combat remains as fun as it’s ever been, but that’s the problem: it’s pretty much exactly the same in Rise of Iron, which raises the question of why this expansion exists at all. Enemies are all just reskins of existing ones — even the first mini-boss is a buffed-up version of Year One boss Sepiks Prime. I’ve done all of it before. But, to its credit, the environments are familiar in a much more interesting way. Most of Rise of Iron’s new content takes place on Earth in areas we’ve already seen, but now that SIVA’s literal tendrils cover the land there are new and clever places to take cover that make it feel fresh (or as fresh as a neurotechnology-infested ruin in what used to be Russia can possibly be). In a shooter that focuses on how you use your environment to survive a horde, an update to existing areas goes a long way.  I've done all of it before.  The new zone, Plaguelands, is a SIVA-infested expansion on the familiar Cosmodrome and complements the reimagined areas well, which makes it a compelling area to explore. It’s a bit of an homage to Year One Destiny while still being a totally new location, and that makes fighting reskinned enemies a bit more interesting than it is elsewhere in the campaign.   The story itself unfolds more clearly than most in Destiny, which was refreshing, though it’s not a terribly good story in general. It’s a lot to cover — the truth of what happened to the once-immortal Iron Lords and how the Fallen found SIVA in the first place — but Rise of Iron does it succinctly. The letdown is that without any original twist or surprises, it falls a bit flat by the end. The story of heroes who sacrifice themselves for the greater good can be exciting if done well, but Rise of Iron’s retelling is a simple and uninspired version of it.   It’s also a little short, and a lot of that is due to how combat in the campaign fails to match the scale of the threat portrayed by the plot. SIVA seems far too easily subdued considering how much it’s built up as an apocalyptic problem. Of course, like with other storylines in Destiny, you’re not supposed to totally eliminate the threat or there’d be no point in doing all the side quests and grinding against those new enemies. But the big reveal and subsequent (really fun) boss fight happen too close together, almost as if something was cut out. One mission, we’re just trying to get more information about SIVA, and the next we’re suddenly facing the baddies head on. Rise of Iron definitely didn’t need to be nearly as long as The Taken King’s eight-hour campaign, but it was strange to go from a few missions of fighting regular waves to a much more intense, strategic boss fight without much of a ramp-up.  Combat in the campaign fails to match the scale of the threat portrayed by the plot.  Luckily, that pacing problem doesn’t take too much away from that fight itself. Up until the end, combat is more about positioning than anything else, and it’s difficult because the waves of SIVA-infused Fallen can quickly overwhelm an area. Those initial missions are fun because I had to move constantly to cheat death, but they’re one-note in that what happens in any one mission is pretty similar to the next. The final fight required me to take what I’d learned about positioning and apply it carefully, and it was the only time during the campaign that I felt like I needed a concrete strategy.   Like in the campaign, the post-story gameplay of Rise of Iron is at its most interesting when bosses are in the mix. The new strike mission is like the final story mission boss fight in that it requires careful, more strategic positioning, and I loved it because it built upon the campaign while being different enough to not feel repetitive. Rise of Iron could’ve used a lot more of that.  Rise of Iron is at its most interesting when bosses are in the mix.  After that, it’s disappointing that there’s little to alleviate the repetition that comes in between finishing most of the new content and doing the raid. Playlists let you play random strikes to get better gear, but I hadn’t leveled up much at all before I’d exhausted them and had to start repeating those same strikes over and over. It definitely kept me and the most hardcore of my friends occupied for a while, but a few powerful new weapons weren’t enough to cure my intense sisyphean frustration.   Archon’s Forge, the new Horde-style arena similar to The Taken King’s Court of Oryx, is a good place to experience those satisfying boss fights. But, like with a lot of things in Rise of Iron, the idea is not new — it’s just a slightly altered take on something we’ve already done. While combat holds up well here, too, it’s also not introducing a different or improved way to do the things Destiny’s been doing all along. (The same goes for the new PVP mode, which is similar to Call of Duty's Kill Confirmed.) The saving grace is a challenging, satisfying raid that combines greatly increased difficulty with far more intense tactics than anything else in the expansion. Each of the five sections (technically, including two with the same boss) builds on the last, and coordinating an effective strategy is as hard as it is to execute the first time around. It doesn’t reinvent the Destiny raid, but it’s worth the grinding it takes to get there. Rise of Iron has just enough new content to keep me coming back for a while, but it feels like the bare minimum. When I wasn’t absentmindedly grinding against reskinned enemies until I couldn’t do it anymore, I was falling down the rabbit hole of side quests and trying out new weapons while patrolling the Plaguelands. The satisfying but still not groundbreaking raid is a decent reward at the end. I wish this expansion had focused more on fixing Destiny’s repetition problems, because it has a few good ideas — but with all its pitfalls, this is just Destiny going through the motions.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	 System Rift takes characters and places from different parts of the Deus Ex universe and connects them in a neat, interesting way. It even hints at some potentially ambitious new directions for the series to explore. But while it’s substantially larger in size than the first episodic add-on, Desperate Measures, it doesn’t provide enough space for the new connections it makes to truly breathe and develope. System Rift starts in a new hub area within Prague, and continues on into a super-high-security satellite installation of the Palisade Bank known as Blade 1. You could blaze through it all in just under two hours if you really wanted to, but like the rest of Mankind Divided, you’d be missing out.  There’s a lot of meat to scrape out of the nooks and crannies in and around the Blade. There were stores and buildings I never went into and alternate routes I spotted but couldn’t take with the augments I’d chosen, and that’s just in the hub.   The Blade itself is huge - six floors worth of well-guarded offices topped off by another infiltration space that’s crammed with a preposterous number of automated security devices. A daunting number of robotic drones patrol the two-floor area, and its chambers are laced with arrays of moving laser-grids and turrets equipped with infra-red sensors that can detect Jensen even if he's using a stealth camouflage aug. It really tested me, successfully making me feel like I was infiltrating a malicious corporate entity of near-limitless reach and resources. It made me feel like I was infiltrating a malicious corporate entity of near-limitless reach and resources.  The story formally brings self-aggrandizing hacker and security analyst Frank Pritchard back into the fold from Human Revolution, and he and Jensen pick up their fun like/hate relationship without skipping a beat. Annoying as he can be, Pritchard brings out the human being in Jensen nicely, making him ever so slightly more relatable than his wooden demeanor usually allows. The hacker Shadowchild, who you might recognize if you’ve been playing Mankind Divided’s Breach mode, also makes an appearance, and she knows a thing or two about Pritchard herself. There’s even a section of Breach-style platforming and puzzle-solving at one point, which finally ties the ancillary mode into the main story in a meaningful way. But it’s still a bit too small in scope to tell a fully contained story of its own. While there are a few sidequests you can pursue, and lots of the typical Deus Ex passive storytelling through overheard conversations and emails if you take your time, System Rift is only long enough to connect some dots and imply new, potentially exciting directions the story could take; it stops short of delivering any revelatory conclusions though. System Rift does an admirable job of tying Breach mode into the main story while starting to fill in the gaps between Human Revolution and Mankind Divided, but it doesn't feel complete unto itself. You’ll get two to four hours more of excellent Deus Ex gameplay, and a glimpse of what the future may hold, but not much more, which is just a bit of a tease.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	 Graphics aren’t everything - but they’re something. The sandbox-style RPG Mount & Blade: Warband is perhaps best compared to a work like the Bayeux Tapestry, a 230-foot long strip of cloth in northern France detailing one of the landmark events of the European Middle Ages. Background details barely show up at all, the people look two generations removed from Gumby, and the weavers couldn't even keep the lines on the border straight. Yet it's stunning to behold. Some parts look like kindergartners made it, but it has soul and heart, and its images remain better embedded in my memory than some of the busy masterworks of the renaissance. Mount & Blade: Warband, which is likewise focused on a medieval setting, feels a little like that. It already looked a decade old when it first came out on PC in 2010 (and recieved a review score of 8.1), and some minor updates to its Xbox One and PlayStation 4 release do little to make it look remotely modern. Slight variations on the same eight or so ugly faces populate its six kingdoms. Knights and peasants alike jank about like robots. Details like grass often vanish when you’re just a few yards away, and tricky gamepad controls sometimes become annoying. And yet for all that, this remains a roleplaying game that does a better job of conveying the rags-to-riches journey than a game like Skyrim.  Look past its shabby exterior and you'll find depth, replayability, and ambition that few competitors can match. It doesn't show you the ropes much, aside from a tutorial for its unique combat system (which lets you control your attacks with most weapons from multiple directions), and the way it drops you into its world with scant explanation can be off-putting in this age of carefully orchestrated, world-saving plots told from the perspective of gruff, named protagonists. Never once does it hint from the outset that you can win your own taxable land through a strategic marriage, nor does it tell you you'll probably have to fight for that potential spouse's favor in a duel. The character-creation screen hints at least suggest you can make your living as a merchant shuttling goods from the deserts of the south to the snows of the north along with fighting, but it says little about the opportunities to herd cattle rather than winning glory of the battlefield.  One of the best parts about Mount & Blade: Warband is that it's not just about you. One of the best parts about Mount & Blade: Warband is that it's not just about you. Few other combat-driven RPGs do such a great job of creating the semblance of a living world. All the while you're out clearing bandits for lords or delivering letters for kings, the diplomatic relations of the surrounding kingdoms are shifting and evolving, possibly making once-comfortable jaunts a risky prospect but a few in-game days later. In contrast to the relatively static land of the Elder Scrolls, this isn't a place where the inhabitants wait around for you to do something before pursuing their own self-interests. Nor is it a place where a single dude can forge a place for himself in the world with pluck and plot armor alone. You’re not a superhero in this world, so captivity and failure happen often in the early hours, sometimes pulling you from near-greatness to crushing poverty within minutes. The frequent autosaves for the single save file per character heavily punish mistakes or just bad luck, such as getting overwhelmed by too many enemies in chance encounters as you gallop across the world map. As with many things in life, to survive in this cruel world you're going to need some help. More specifically, you're going to need a warband. A memorable band of brothers they're not. Warbands are usually little more than trainable troupes of mercs and peasants you pick up in towns, and they have little by way of personality. However, keeping them happy with steady pay is almost as tough of a struggle as actually fighting.  I found it hard to control my warbands most of the time. Battles should be tough, but the controls make fights difficult to manage for the wrong reasons. On Xbox One, I found it hard to control my warbands most of the time since barking orders at them requires using the D-pad to open one menu and then another, all while the opposing bandits or other opponent rains steel and wood on the confused masses. It doesn't help that elements of the UI sometimes get lost off the edge of the screen. That's far from the only point where Warband struggles to fit gamepads into its world. This is clearly a game designed for mouse and keyboard, and though it occasionally makes thoughtful use of the gamepad (such as the selection boxes for buying gear before multiplayer matches), it more often resorts to the mouse-style cursor that pops up while selecting multiplayer servers, and that’s never a good experience. Control problems frequently frustrate the combat as well. Multiple commands share the same buttons, which complicates the fun of the combat system that lets you attack from the left, right, or overhead. Since the camera's mapped to the right thumbstick that's also used to direct these actions, I sometimes found myself checking out the clouds when hoisting an axe over my head instead of keeping my eye on my opponent. It's fixable: a menu option lets you sacrifice much of the combat depth that sets Warband apart by automating the choice of attack angle. Yet even that doesn't solve other issues, such as the way I frequently found myself accidentally pressing the left thumbstick, triggering a disorienting perspective shift between first- and third-person. It's nothing I couldn't get used to. (Even the PC version has a tough learning curve in this regard.) And it's certainly never so bad that it takes away from the sheer fun of the eight multiplayer modes featuring up to 32 players besieging castles, fighting deathmatches, or simple dueling one on one. As much as I love Warband's deep roleplay elements, for me this is where its true fun lies. Few moments in games lately have thrilled me as when I charged up a ramped siege tower on my horse and impaled the two archers waiting on the ramparts with my spear. Then, whipping out my sword, I rushed down the wall cut down the four players in my way. If Warband had an Overwatch-style Play of the Game highlight, that would have been it. When all of Warband's combat elements come together – multiple weapons, great mounted combat, and sieges – and the controls get out of the way, it works so well that I almost entirely forget that it's as ugly as a bacteria sample from the Blarney Stone. Mount & Blade: Warband may not have a carefully guided plot or even reasonably attractive graphics, but it recreates the sensation of living in a medieval world like few other games by allowing freedom to decide your own approach to carving out your destiny in a dynamic world of rapidly changing alliances. Controls are awkward at best, making it tough to appreciate how good the combat is, but there's a lot of fun here, especially in the eight multiplayer modes for up to 32 players. As a veteran of the PC version, which I love, I feel bad not being able to recommend the console version more highly, but this port doesn’t fully allow Mount & Blade’s charm to shine through.
Chris Schilling	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	" FIFA 17’s headline feature is The Journey, a story about a prodigious young talent attempting to make a name for himself in the Premier League. It’s a microcosm of everything that’s good and bad about FIFA – peerless presentation surrounding a match engine that’s an improvement on last year, but still needs work – and yet it’s the most fun I’ve had with the series for a good few seasons. Perhaps more importantly, it’s a welcome reminder of the personal stories at the heart of a sport (and a series) that, in recent times, has felt more concerned with its corporate identity. It’s not easy to find ways to surprise people in an annualised game, but this is a very pleasant one. The story of likeable 17-year-old Alex Hunter and his rise from unvarnished academy product to bright young starlet follows a conventional path – not quite rags to riches, but close – though it’s affectingly told, even if FIFA 17’s PEGI rating ensures that it’s a rather airbrushed take on the modern game. Still, the setbacks and insults sting – on his debut as a substitute the opposition fans taunt him with a chant of “who are ya?” while you’ll attract social media criticism from supporters and fellow professionals (at one stage, an embittered ex-teammate hashtags you as a #benchwarmer). Naturally, this only made me all the more determined to succeed.  As someone who has been horrified by the steady marginalisation of this great football institution, Hunter’s passion for the FA Cup (driven by a family legacy, as per sports movie tradition) struck a powerful chord with me, and I shared his frustration at being considered too young to feature in a blood-and-thunder cup tie. When Swansea, my chosen team, finally gave him his chance, I was determined that Hunter (and I) would take it – and we did. As he slotted in his third goal the crowd began chanting his name before launching into a full-throated version of Hymns and Arias, and I’m not too proud to say I got a little choked up. It’s sentimental, but appropriately so – football fans seem especially prone to outbursts of emotion, from full-blown weeping at relegations to misty-eyed reminiscences of “the good old days”. The Journey also represents the fripperies of the modern game well, as you’d expect – from post-match interviews with dialogue responses that can affect your standing with your manager, teammates, and supporters, to a choice of branded boots for your first sponsorship deal. If the excessive branding is a bit of a turn-off, it’s also quite authentic. Otherwise, The Journey is surprisingly down to earth. Hunter’s more impressed by his achievements on the pitch than what they earn him off it, and there’s a particularly lovely moment where he gets his first full start and experiences a sudden rush of nervous pride at the realisation that he’s going to kick off the game. Aided by a terrific Atticus Ross score, which is emotive without feeling manipulative, The Journey follows its familiar storyline with real conviction.  It’s not easy to find ways to surprise people in an annualised game, but [The Journey] is a very pleasant one. It functions quite beautifully as a tutorial, too. Though it might seem unlikely to have a striker so regularly tasked with defensive drills, by covering all facets of the game you become a better player along with Hunter. You can simulate the sessions if you want to skip them, but if you do you’re less likely to improve and you’ll usually be awarded a lower grade – which might not help if you need to impress the manager after a 6/10 display in the previous game. It’s a valuable message for any youngsters playing the game, espousing the need for hard work to succeed. Hunter might eventually boast a lavish city-centre apartment when he finally hits the big time, but I felt like he’d really earned it. It’s worth pointing out that while you can contribute to Hunter’s journey, your progress is bound to the needs of the story. In the early stages, I regularly fulfilled the manager’s expectations even during limited substitute appearances, but I still found myself watching the game from the bench and eventually being shipped out on loan. Sometimes, the demands for bonus achievements are entirely unreasonable – trailing 3-0 to Man City with less than half an hour left, I was somehow expected to achieve five shots on target and come away with at least a draw.  That’s particularly difficult given the ability of your AI opponents to retain possession for several minutes at a time thanks to changes to FIFA’s physics making it easier to shield the ball. When I earned a place as a regular starter, in the vast majority of games I’d have less than 40% possession; that makes it realistically tough to make a name for yourself in one sense, but even if you make the most of your few chances it’s still frustrating to see so little of the ball. It perhaps says something that you’re given the option to play as a team rather than just controlling Hunter – and after a few games playing that way I felt much more involved and less irritated by teammates’ errors. There’s nothing worse than being penalised for a ‘bad call for a pass’ when the pass itself was inaccurate. The grading is questionable elsewhere, too. While jostling with a defender, I found myself losing points for apparently conceding possession three times, but wasn’t rewarded for regaining it as I finally sprinted clear. Perfectly good shots that are well blocked by smart defending are classed as ‘poor’. During one narrow victory, I quite deliberately played the ball off a defender to earn a corner and relieve some of the pressure my team had been under; the manager’s comments after the game chided me for conceding possession.  [The opposition] might be difficult to win possession from, but they’re often easy to exploit with more direct play EA Sports attempts to take the sting out of that by having AI players occasionally make glaring mistakes, but the result is that the quality of the opposition veers from Barcelona to Barnet and back again in the space of a minute. They might be difficult to win possession from, but they’re often easy to exploit with more direct play. In one game, I won 3-0 with 32% possession, having watched my opponent play keep-ball in midfield for the final 20 minutes. Tellingly, I found commentator Martin Tyler repeat his assertion that you don’t need to dominate the ball to win a game after every other game I played. But while FIFA still doesn’t do enough to distinguish the playstyle of individual teams, there are some signs of improvement over last year’s game. For example, I noticed a particular difference in style when playing Leicester City: they took more risks, moved the ball quicker, and played more direct football, making for much more exciting, dynamic matches. In one thrilling moment, as Jamie Vardy hared past my back line, I brought a defender across, putting him under just enough pressure to force him to rush his shot, which whistled over the crossbar. It’s the most authentic FIFA has felt to me in quite a while. Pace, having been nerfed last year, is back to being slightly overpowered, though with PES arguably taking it a shade too far the other way it’s refreshing to have the ability to outsprint full-backs. For all that extra burst of speed, though, I found responsiveness to still be an issue – it’s anyone’s guess whether you’ll manage to get a shot away before a defender closes in. Tweaks have been made to off-the-ball runs but the execution is uneven – teammates will try to move into more intelligent positions to receive the ball, but at times this means running directly across you. The player-selection algorithm also needs work, and flat passing can be bizarrely wayward – more than once, I’ve watched in dismay as a short five-yard pass has been interpreted as a command to hoof the ball out of play. Crosses, meanwhile, sometimes feel more like underarm throws into the box, with the inevitable interception greeted almost every time with the same line from Tyler: “Well, the ball deserved perhaps a better response from his teammates in the middle.""  For all the adjustments and additions that don’t quite work, you can hardly accuse EA Sports of not trying. Some might argue that the new systems for set-pieces and penalties are changes for change’s sake. But while I did wonder if having to adjust your position in the run-up to penalties might be a needless complication of what should be a simple process, I’m sure plenty will appreciate the greater nuance – and, admittedly, it does add to the pressure. All told, there’s still plenty of room for improvement, but the on-pitch action is an advance on last year. And if the new Frostbite engine hasn’t had a tangible effect on the way FIFA plays, it certainly has on the way it looks. The broad, round-shouldered players of last year are gone, replaced by models that look much more like actual human beings. With better likenesses, including all 20 Premier League managers, in visual terms FIFA 17 is a clear step ahead of its biggest rival. Elsewhere, there’s such a sprawl of modes and features that it’s impossible to cover them all in detail - suffice to say that FIFA gets more comprehensive and overwhelming every year. Themed challenges are your main incentive to keep coming back to the ever compulsive Ultimate Team mode, with new ones set to be introduced over the course of the football season. There’s a new FUT Champions mode, too, which tasks you with scoring enough points to qualify for a weekend league, success in which can earn you in-game prizes. Career mode, meanwhile, offers more comprehensive club management options while letting you create an avatar for your manager so you can prowl the touchline and respond to events on the field. For all that FIFA promises something for every football fan, from the casual observer to the full-kit fanatic, I still find myself wishing that EA Sports would spend a little more time focusing on the basics. You could probably create the perfect football game by letting Konami handle everything on the pitch, with EA Sports responsible for everything off it. But FIFA plays well enough that the gains elsewhere – in terms of licensing, authenticity, and big-match atmosphere – more than compensate for those shortcomings. For my money, PES is still ahead where it counts most, but The Journey gives FIFA something unique and rewarding. If you can afford it, this year it might just be worth getting both."
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	 Update: Forza Horizon 3 has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  The term we use in Australia for what Americans call doing doughnuts is “circle work.” Right now I’m doing some spectacular circle work around an outback airstrip in a custom V8 ute with all the trimmings. I’m talking high-powered spotlights, a CB antenna sticking proudly up into the air, and a giant, mesh-filled roo bar that looks like it’s fallen off the front of a Kenworth. ‘Thunderstruck’ is banging on my stereo and the tacho needle is banging on the redline. This is Forza Horizon 3 for me; an experience that could only get more Australian if it was delivered inside a giant jar of Vegemite by Paul Hogan crashing into your living room riding an actual crocodile. But maybe that’s not your bag. You may prefer classic American muscle, or perhaps you’re more partial to Japanese tuners from the turn of the century, or maybe you haven’t got time for anything but European hypercars. That’s okay too, because the Forza franchise is famous for its wonderfully eclectic approach to car curation and Forza Horizon 3 is no exception; it’s still the best in the business. The big difference here is that with its new level of car customisation and personalisation, an incredibly malleable career experience that can be played solo or co-op with friends, and even baked-in support for a soundtrack of your own choosing, Horizon 3 can be bent to your desires like never before in the series. Combined with dazzling landscapes and lighting effects, outstanding sound design, and well-honed driving dynamics, the results are absolutely fantastic.    The standard for this series is very high. Back in 2014 Forza Horizon 2 delivered us a sumptuous slab of Mediterranean coastline; a splendid, summertime jaunt through the rolling fields and quaint seaside towns of southern Europe that felt like it was lifted from an episode of Top Gear. It’s lovely, truly. And Horizon 3’s world just crushes it. The cars may be the stars here, but it’s the stage that steals the show.  The cars may be the stars here, but it’s the stage that steals the show. There isn’t any one reason, but many that add up. The attention to detail, for example, is magnificent, and as an Australian it’s certainly something I can wholly vouch for. The road markings, the street signs, even the garbage bins with their multi-coloured lids. It’s eerie, really. The lighting is astonishing, too, with the amazingly authentic sky bathing the whole environment in uncannily realistic sunlight and casting crisper shadows. (The latter are at their most superb as you wind through the thick rainforest sections as the sun tries to pierce through the tall trees.) Water plays a big part, too, and not just because the entire place looks even better slick from rain. Everything from the gently sloshing waves by the Twelve Apostles to the wake created by your wheels as you putter across shallow streams is top notch. Its greatest strength is probably the sheer variety of landscapes, though. Horizon 3 remains dwarfed by the likes of The Crew’s impressively large map, but it packs a pile of vastly different terrains into its Australian backdrop. There’s a quiet coastal town, with its picturesque beaches, and the rolling fields between it and the high-rise, urban metropolis of Surfers Paradise. There’s the damp and dense rainforest carpeted with thick undergrowth around closely packed trees. There’s also rural wine country that gives way to the sparse red dust and isolated farms of the outback. If anything, Horizon 3’s outback zone isn’t really big enough to communicate the sheer vastness of the real thing that I’d yearned for (shelve your hopes of any arrow-straight highways disappearing over the, er, horizon) but it’s nonetheless a noticeable improvement over Horizon 2 where all four corners of the map felt largely similar to each other. Bush bashing. The lighting certainly helps a great deal, though, as the differences between each area are also heightened by Horizon 3’s new global illumination lighting system. It gives the outback a different hue to, say, the rainforest zone as the light picks up an orange tint from the sunburnt soil. The whole environment looks extra special in the pitch black of night, too, with the red glow of the roadside reflectors and the glint of approaching signs responding to your car’s headlights. Global illumination also does wonders for the car models, seating them in the world better than ever. It’s perhaps telling that despite the fact I’m a dyed-in-the-wool cabin view enthusiast I’m finding myself more and more regularly opting to cruise with the chase cam to marvel at the way the cars gleam and pick up realistic reflections, even of the clouds above. Cabin view, however, is the best seat in the house from which to behold Horizon 3’s wet weather. It’s improved markedly from Horizon 2, with droplets now streaking across the glass and being shoved around by the wipers, as seen in last year’s Forza Motorsport 6. The price for all this eye candy on Xbox One is that Horizon 3 runs at 30 frames per second (as with previous Horizon games) although it remains locked there always, providing a smooth and consistent driving experience. The only time I ever saw it stumble was during the vignettes you get upon discovering a barn find (which are back, more plentiful than ever, and better disguised on the menu screens prior to their discovery). The PC version is blissfully unrestricted. It's better down where it's wetter. Another area of improvement is the spectacular audio; Horizon 3 is the best-sounding Forza game to date – including Forza Motorsport. The step up from Horizon 2 is immediately noticeable, and that’s already a great-sounding game, but there’s just something about the exhaust notes here in Horizon 3 that seem louder and more aggressive than ever before. I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of feathering the throttle with the backfire that Horizon 3 provides; it’s like the crack of a rifle. Horizon 2’s brand of simple and seamless opt in/opt out multiplayer returns and now includes include new co-op functionality, so if you don’t want to play the career mode alone you can join three friends and tackle it in co-op. Everything you discover and complete is consistent across multiplayer and solo play, which is great design.   Beyond its prowess when it comes to presentation, Horizon 3’s big bullet point is its pliability. There are more car customisation options than ever, and the best ones are sorted into a separate menu, so it’s clear before purchasing which rides will feature the new widebody kits and blower options. 2015’s Need for Speed actually made up a lot of ground on the Forza franchise’s level of customisation (even surpassing it in some areas, like the ability to place decals on glass, for instance) but Horizon 3 is a confident response to the challenge. Just Stance 2016. We’re also no longer restricted to a default avatar; rather we can now choose from a selection, à la Test Drive Unlimited. Playground has even had its voice actors record a host of names the commentary will refer to you by, which is a cute touch. It defaulted to Luke, but I chose ‘Sausage’ because I’m clearly easily amused. Every time I load my game I hear Anna, my GPS assistant, say, “Welcome back, Sausage!” It’s impossible not to drive away with a grin after that greeting. You’re no longer restricted to the in-game music, either, and I really can’t stress enough how much I love the Groove Music integration here. It really is surprisingly easy to play your own music in Horizon 3 and it’s absolutely worth a try if you love driving to particular tunes. While I mentioned ‘Thunderstruck’ in the intro, Horizon 3 contains no AC/DC; I’m just playing my own. Having the built-in ability to stream your music itself is different to just playing background music via the Groove app on your Xbox One, too. Done in-game it’ll play just like any of the included radio stations; there’s no DJ but your songs will get the full post-processing treatment any time you drive into a festival location so it’ll sound like your radio has just given way to a live concert. That said, my personal songs would occasionally hang and skip like a badly scratched CD, but I can’t tell if that’s a bandwidth issue on my part or a technical one with the functionality itself. Hey there, Blimpy Boy. But it’s the flexibility of the racing events themselves that gives us almost complete control over how Horizon 3 unfolds. Horizon 2 allowed us to rock up to a new championship and completely ignore the suggested car class, which meant we could progress towards the festival’s grand finale without ever leaving the cars we wanted to drive most. Horizon 3 goes a step further, not only by adjusting certain events automatically depending on what car you’ve brought to the start point but also by allowing us to either completely re-script the event from the ground up ourselves, or race a custom event created by friends or other Horizon 3 players. The functionality is dubbed Horizon Blueprint and lets us select the time of day, the weather, the competition, and even the name of the race itself. It’s brilliant, and means every event can be raced in dozens and dozens of different ways under a whole range of conditions. Completing your own or your friends’ Blueprint events will net you the same rewards you’d earn for opting for the “official” events Playground has baked in. You can even create your own Bucket List challenges – the one-off, themed events introduced in Horizon 2 – starting at predetermined points in the world. About my only gripe here is that the Horizon 3 still isn’t nuanced enough to distinguish between Ford vehicles from the US, the UK, and Australia. As a result Horizon 3’s Australian-themed race category ‘Aussie Rules’ is kind of a waste of space right now, considering Aussie Fords remain sorted as US cars and aren’t eligible. An odd miss considering how utterly reverent Horizon 3 otherwise is to its setting. Forza Horizon 3 is a masterclass in open-world racing and bigger and better than its excellent predecessor across the board. It looks fantastic, the car selection and customisation is second to none, and the size and variety of the sprawling Australian outback is magnificent. Above all, Horizon 3 never loses sight of the fact that tearing through postcard-perfect locations should be fun, and it puts the tools in our hands to keep it that way, always. This is the racing game I’ve been waiting for, and it's officially my favourite thing on four wheels. A fair dinkum triumph, mates.
Jonathon Dornbush	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/bioshock-the-collection-review	 Stepping back into Rapture after an extended time away felt like coming home in BioShock: The Collection. Bringing together the trilogy of games and all of their respective DLC, The Collection offers the best opportunity for newcomers to dive into some of the most memorable first-person shooters of the last generation. Longtime fans of lighthouses, Big Daddys, and plasmids, on the other hand, will find uneven rewards across the three games. IGN gave BioShock a 9.7 upon its original release, calling it “one of those monumental experiences you’ll never forget.” And that memorable exploration of objectivism and utopian ideals wrapped in a collapsed Art Deco underwater city remains an impactful one. What struck me most about starting up the original BioShock as part of The Collection was just how evocative the introduction remains.   The original BioShock receives the most noticeable visual upgrade — Rapture looks as beautiful and haunting as I remembered the 2007 version appearing in my head. Sure, even with the visual polish it can’t quite stand up to some of the detailed worlds being produced today, but Rapture’s dank, collapsing corridors are still a wonder to behold based on their style if not their technology. As an experienced BioShock player back for more I’ve searched every nook and cranny of that underwater city several times before, and yet I still found myself scouring corners once again because there’s now a new incentive to explore all of Rapture: an unlockable director’s commentary video series called “Imagining BioShock.”   The multi-part series, found via film reels hidden in Rapture, is the only major content addition to any game in The Collection, but it’s a good one because we get to watch Irrational Games’ Creative Director Ken Levine and Animation Director Shawn Robertson breaking down the original BioShock from its initial conception to the final product. After that cohesive and entertaining look back it’s disappointing that neither BioShock 2 nor BioShock Infinite have any new content at all.  It’s disappointing that neither BioShock 2 nor BioShock Infinite have any new content at all. Speaking of those two sequels, BioShock 2 (which IGN originally gave a 9.1 in 2010) has a more subtle visual update. It’s mostly seen in the improved lighting of the still-crumbling Rapture so the difference isn’t as stark as BioShock 1’s revamped textures. It still plays well, though – while the plot feels like a retread of the themes and concepts that made the first such an intriguing story, the smart changes to gameplay (dual-wielding plasmids and weapons seems like a revelation when compared to the first game) and focus on wave-based combat during certain scenarios are a welcome upgrade. In fact, the biggest change to BioShock 2 in The Collection is that it lacks its multiplayer this time around. Though it worked surprisingly well for a tacked-on multiplayer mode of that era in the original version, its absence isn’t a deal breaker in a collection focused on strong single-player experiences. (Note that the Uncharted series’ Nathan Drake Collection also dropped the old multiplayer modes — this may be a trend.)   BioShock Infinite (which IGN gave a 9.4 in 2013), meanwhile, is a more modern game to begin with, so the only perceptible change to the Collection version as compared to the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 edition is the higher resolution, better texture quality, and smoother 60 frames per second frame rate that finally matches the PC version. The beautiful floating citadel remains picturesque and bright, which is a welcome change after two go-arounds submerged in the depths of the ocean. But as a returning visitor, Infinite’s beauty is less immediately striking than it was, and the lack of upgrades or new content left me less motivated to explore. With that said, Infinite and its fantastic Burial at Sea parts 1 and 2 expansions still feel like the ambitious follow-up the original BioShock needed. Not all of its twists and turns work, and the middle section can still be a slog to work through (the Lady Comstock battle will forever be a pain). Yet Infinite’s world is still one imbued with a sense of wonder that remains worthy of playing through. As a veteran returning to play through the three games of BioShock: The Collection is a pleasure, but it’s a bit disappointing to watch the updates and behind-the-scenes content to each entry gradually decline. The original BioShock receives the greatest overhaul and flourishes with new textures and lighting that bring it almost up to modern standards, and a Ken Levine retrospective, while BioShock Infinite is essentially the PC version Of course the ideas and gameplay presented and executed in all three are as memorable as they were when first released, and anyone who missed them a decade ago should definitely consider rectifying that. If you intend to play one of these fascinating and fun adventures for the first time or the tenth, the BioShock Collection is the best way to go about it.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	" Ten years after releasing the original Dead Rising on the Xbox 360, Capcom has up-rezed some of the games from it’s zombie-themed series for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Dead Rising Triple Pack digitally bundles Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2, and its Frank West-starring expansion, Dead Rising 2: Off the Record, plus all their associated DLC costumes. But that’s about it. So what’s special about this collection? Other than being able to easily play these games with all their add-ons at 1080p and 60 frames per second, which is definitely the best way to do it, not a lot. There’s no making of or retrospective content here – it’s the games and nothing but the games. The additional outfits are nice if you’re looking to dress up like a ninja, a cardboard robot, or cosplay Frank as katana-wielding Johnny Cash, but their value is cosmetic and fleeting.  IGN gave Dead Rising an 8.3 for ""great"", though the decade-old zombie-slaying experience hasn’t aged especially well, and bumping up the resolution can only do so much to improve it. Performance-wise, the bump to 60 frames per second certainly helps smooth out the panning camera, especially since there are usually dozens of zombies on screen at once. So that’s a lot easier on the eyes. The only place the frame rate takes a dive is when using a few specific weapons, such as the sledge hammer. That has to be a bug.  But let’s call it like it is: The Dead Rising series hasn’t ever been about twitchy reaction time. Zombies are slow and their reach is pretty forgiving. So the frame rate isn’t going to make you a more efficient slayer of the undead. The original Dead Rising in particular leans pretty heavily on mechanics that mitigate input lag. Buildup time for power attacks is still a major part of the experience. So though the boost in framerate is welcome, it’s not really a game changer for this style of action game. Dead Rising 2 received and 8.0 from IGN, and Dead Rising 2: Off the Record originally scored a 7 for ""good"". Thankfully, both of these games get much more out of the up-rez treatment thanks to their relatively more recent visuals.  They’re essentially the same game, story-wise, though Off the Record adds an excellent sandbox mode with challenges that the series has always needed. Both these games handle much better than the Dead Rising, and therefore similarly get more from the 60 frame-per-second bump, though some cutscenes still appear slightly jerky and jagged. Another caveat is that this bundle does not include Dead Rising 2: Case Zero, or Dead Rising 2: Case West. That’s strange omission considering they’re part of Dead Rising 2’s family of games.  The bottom line is if you haven’t played any three of these games, this is the best looking console version to date, and these enduring zombie-smashing games are still worth a playthrough.  Outside of that, there’s nothing new in this Triple Pack to draw old Frank West fans back to experience the chaos again before he returns in Dead Rising 4 this December."
Chris Schilling	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	 Last year, I said that PES 2016 might well be the best football game ever made. I also said that think it was too early to say that with absolute confidence; that it would be some time before its standing could be properly measured. Over months of play, a few small cracks appeared in the façade – nothing that could convince me that this wasn’t the finest simulation of the beautiful game I’d played in quite some time, but enough to make me wonder if I’d been a little too generous in my early assessment. So it’s with no small amount of trepidation that I say this: PES 2017 is better. As with last year, PES 2017 the kind of game that benefits from a host of incremental improvements that have a collectively beneficial effect. These are the kind of tweaks that it’s hard to talk about on the back of a game’s box or its online store page, but it demonstrates a commitment to the basics of the game that goes beyond adding features for the sake of having something that can be easily promoted with a flashy name.  For me, the pace seems just a shade more measured than last year. That doesn’t mean it’s sluggish, by any means – passing, for example, is as responsive as it was last year. But, together with the adjustments to defensive AI, I found myself having to be a little more patient and methodical in breaking down opponents. You can still play more quick and direct football, as long as you’re set up to do so, but by and large you have to work a little harder for your openings. I think it’s still a little too hard for pacey players to get clear of opponents they should be able to have on toast, but there is a tangible difference with the quickest of the quick – you’ll notice the difference when controlling the likes of Pierre Emerick Aubameyang or Leroy Sane. Further efforts have been made to distinguish individual players, and the playing styles of the game’s biggest stars are instantly recognisable, from Antoine Griezmann’s speed of thought and feet to the flashy technique of Neymar who can also remove his shirt in a unique goal celebration (for which he’ll rightly be booked). Elsewhere, the recovery time after losing the ball seems to have been shortened; certainly, I found myself winning the ball back after conceding possession a little more often. Collisions, too, now feel more authentic – I no longer experienced that strange phenomenon whereby two players would occasionally come together and then both suddenly bounce off in opposite directions. You’ll still encounter the occasional bit of weirdness, but that’s true of almost any game with so many variables and moving parts, and such oddities are relatively scarce.   This year’s goalkeepers are one feature Konami really should be shouting about. They will make mistakes, yes, but they’re more convincingly human ones rather than the kind of blunder you can predict before it happens. They’ll rarely drop the more straightforward catches, and will more frequently hold onto softer shots rather than spill them into the path of onrushing strikers. The best stoppers will react quicker to deflections, too – perfectly illustrated during one game where a fortunate ricochet forced David de Gea to change direction, twisting to shovel the ball out for a corner. Later, he acrobatically flung himself across his goal to tip away a thunderous 20-yard half-volley from Fernandinho – a moment that also served to highlight how good the shooting feels. Long-range strikes won’t always find the top corner, but the connections you make when the ball sits up perfectly feel crisp and clean. The same could be said of the passing, but that’s always been a PES strength. But this year, Konami has made a change that might upset a few of the purists. Essentially, it’s a system that will, under the right set of circumstances, gently massage the trajectory of a pass to pinpoint precision. It depends on a number of factors, including the quality of the passer, the space in which they find themselves, and the position of the receiver relative to their markers. Once or twice, it felt to me like defenders had slowed up slightly to allow a runner to receive a ball on his instep and burst clear. But for the most part, it’s handled expertly, convincing you that you were wholly responsible for that perfect clipped through-ball. You found the right moment and the right type of pass, sure, but it was Konami’s invisible guiding hand that changed a good ball into a thing of beauty.  Goalkeepers are one feature Konami should be shouting about  It handles the uglier moments well, too - though it’s slightly ironic that jostling at corners should be more noticeable at a time when referees have been told to clamp down on pushing and shirt-pulling in the box. Goalmouth scrambles feel frantic and faintly comical, just as they should, while AI opponents concede more fouls – one of my favourites saw Raheem Sterling pull off a sharp turn on the edge of the box and the defender’s trailing leg hooked his right foot. Free-kicks are still a relatively infrequent occurrence, but you’ll rarely go through a game without a handful of fouls, and if the ref blows, it rarely feels like he’s being too fussy. Replays will always highlight when you stepped in and got more man than ball with a standing challenge. The flipside of the coin is that they won’t penalise you as often for clean sliding tackles, no matter how loudly the crowd roars. And when the whistle does go, you’ll find set-pieces are more flexible, with a welcome ability to tinker with a variety of dead-ball strategies. Konami’s made a concerted effort to improve the online game, too. Already, the squad updates are in places, so you’ll see Paul Pogba in midfield for Man United (or should I say Man Red) and Claudio Bravo in goal for City - though at the time of writing, you’re still unable to buy MyClub dollars. So far, an average of one in every five or six games we’ve played online has been noticeably affected by lag - though if that’s becoming a problem, you can choose to search for a higher connection rating - with quality ranging from one (poor) to five (excellent). Most of our games at three and above ran very smoothly - though Konami’s decision to implement region-locking means you won’t be able to play with any friends in the US, for example. You can also refine your search by the class of opposition or their level of pass support - and there’s an option to have the game gradually widen the parameters to accommodate a greater range of skill and/or courtesy levels if it can’t find anyone within your specified conditions.  I’ve noticed a few little idiosyncrasies while playing online that weren’t as obvious against the AI. I found Manuel Neuer a bit of a liability as my MyClub goalie, thanks to his tendency to automatically come out for any high ball pumped towards the edge of the box - on two occasions, he headed a clearance straight into the path of an opposition player. And though the keepers are a marked improvement on last year, they can struggle to hold onto headers. It also seems more important to make sure you’re set up properly for corners. The most reliable approach for me was to select the option to have runners attacking the back post and cross it deep to bypass the opposition defence. The fact that obstructions tend to go unpunished can occasionally be frustrating, too. Besides that, it’s every bit as thrilling and varied as the offline game. I’ve earned scrappy last-minute victories, clung on desperately against better players thanks to a combination of good fortune and excellent goalkeeping, and won two games with less than 40% possession thanks to superior counter-attacking play. You’re allowed one ‘free’ goal celebration that your opponents can’t skip, so make it count.  Obstructions tend to go unpunished, which can occasionally be frustrating  Despite the inability to pay real world cash for MyClub money, Konami’s FUT equivalent has seen a host of small changes. Minor tweaks to the interface make it more readable, and you’re now able to sign scouts with specialities in certain areas, giving you a better chance of finding the type of player your squad desperately needs. If it’s still not quite as slick as EA’s equivalent, I’m a big fan of the way new recruits are handled - the gradual seems designed to highlight the excellent facial models. Some, like Neuer and Carlos Tevez, to name but two examples, are uncannily accurate. Given how close it gets to the sport in both look and feel, the moments where it falls short feel all the more jarring. The commentary from Peter Drury and Jim Beglin feels much more fluid and organic, yet obviously canned soundbites from previous years remain, and there are still too few comments for individual players - if I hear “And the lead is three!” or “That is classic Kun Aguero!” again, it’ll be too soon. And in a game where so much attention has been paid to animation, it’s odd to find players looking so robotic when anticipating a throw-in. The lack of licences is an obvious drawback that persists and may never be resolved – at least not for the foreseeable future – but while it’s something we’ve all grown to expect from PES, it’s disappointing to see the likes of Real Madrid and Juventus unable to use their real names. Still, with continued support for option files, that’s a fixable problem in a game that otherwise doesn’t have much to remedy. With smarter AI opposition and an altogether smoother online experience, PES 2017 is close to the complete package. FIFA’s new story mode might be the most headline-grabbing feature of either game this year, but it’s clear Konami is in no mood to relinquish its title as king of the virtual pitch.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	" ReCore is a new-looking game with a charming, much older-feeling soul. It’s less interested in telling a cohesive story than it is in throwing elaborate, well-designed platform challenges and combat scenarios at you. It’s an old-style approach that’s executed so soundly I wanted to ignore its technical and structural failings, but ultimately they do take some of the wind out of an experience that could have otherwise been great. ReCore starts out strong, building its gameplay suite piece by solid piece. Combat, traversal, and exploration are all handled well individually and balanced nicely against one another so I never felt overloaded or underserved by any one part of it.  Of the three, combat stands out just a bit more because of a skillful mix of decision-making and reflex-testing that feels demanding but never overwhelming. On the surface, color-coding ammo types to the color of enemy they’re strongest against seems almost insultingly simplistic, but it ends up being just one piece of a much larger, more interesting puzzle.   Color aside, each of the five customizable robotic frames for your AI-controlled sidekicks are particularly strong or weak against certain types of foes (such as wolves or tanks) regardless of their color. Knowing this, you might switch to your yellow bot despite facing a blue enemy because you’ll still have the type advantage. Further, recognizing situations where you can exploit both type and color advantages can allow you to fell even the most leathery tough adversaries in seconds.  It’s a challenging balancing act that made me feel genuinely powerful. Combat is full of little nuances like this. You can, for instance, build combo streaks by hacking away notched segments of an enemy's life bar. Higher combos mean bigger damage per shot, so you learn to see small, easy-to-kill enemies or ones with highly segmented health bars as walking power-ups to be ""collected"" before turning to the heftier ones to make optimal use of your increased damage. Over time you get a sense of how different enemies telegraph their moves, which ones are easy to dodge, and which ones you’ll need to interrupt with a charged shot from your rifle instead. You’re thinking about all of this while ninja-ing your way through salvos of bullets, missiles, and laser beams; it’s a challenging balancing act that made me feel genuinely powerful whenever I managed it.  Despite the surprising number of moving parts that come together in battle, ReCore achieves this arcade-style rhythm where each individual element is easy enough to get a grasp on that eventually the commands just come to you in the moment, like suddenly speaking a language instead of just repeating the words you know.  I enjoyed leaping before looking, confident that I'd find sure footing. This delightful sense of instinctive mastery is just as often elicited by ReCore’s elaborately constructed jumping puzzles, and unlike many 3D action games that try to incorporate platforming elements, it’s handled here with a rare grace. Jumps have just enough hang time to give you a moment to mentally visualize where you’ll land without feeling sluggish or floaty, and ledges and moving platforms are placed just so, never requiring more precision than the responsive controls feasibly allow. This builds a high level of trust: I came to believe in the platforming design so completely that I enjoyed leaping before looking, confident that if I made the most of my chained double-jumps and dashes (and the occasional robot-assisted glide) I’d find sure footing somewhere or other. In the heyday of platformers this sensation was common, but few modern games have conjured it forth the way ReCore does.  This is a fortunate thing too, because developers Comcept and Armature have a way of throwing the entire kitchen sink at you all at once. I cackled at some of the more sadistic-looking arrays of timed barriers, laser beams, and moving platforms all dancing with one another over a bottomless pit of instant death. One late-game section has you jumping between tiny moving platforms that appear for only seconds at a time before evaporating, raising my stress levels as only a 3D recreation of an old Mega Man gimmick possibly could. Both in the larger sandbox areas and in the traversal-focused side-dungeons, these intricately designed platform tangles are an intimidating sight, which made it feel all the more sublime when I tore through them with little thought, having been taught so well by the smoothly escalating challenges that preceded them.  The evocative art style helped maintain a sense of mystery and wonder. Exploring ReCore’s beautiful world is almost equally gratifying, though down the stretch of the campaign you’re asked to do so just a bit too often. Its rolling, barren dunes are starkly contrasted with massive industrial structures that look and feel alien, despite being man-made. Monstrous terraforming constructs loom constantly in the background, creating a believable sense of scale that, at times, made me feel pleasingly insignificant. This evocative art style helped maintain a sense of mystery and wonder, despite how summarily barren and incomplete most of ReCore’s world feels. This is by design, according to the lore, though that doesn’t entirely excuse it. While there is a certain minimalistic beauty to Far Eden (where ReCore takes place), the magic began to wear thin as I hit the last third of my adventure. Especially towards the end, your forward progress is constantly impeded by the need to stop what you’re doing and head back out into the overworld to complete side-missions in order to earn Prismatic Orbs, which serve as keys of sorts. This makes many of the side activities essentially mandatory, and because they’re scattered throughout ReCore’s appreciably large play areas there’s a significant amount of travel time involved to reach them. What’s more, obtaining these orbs often requires a specific bot that isn’t telegraphed to you ahead of time, and you can only have two with you at any given time. There were plenty of times I’d trek long and hard to find a tough-to-reach area only to find out I needed a different bot to reap the rewards. The only solution is to head to the nearest waypoint, switch out my bot, and make the journey a second time. Right when ReCore should be crescendoing towards its conclusion, its pace suddenly sputters instead.  Along with the long load times these inconveniences break up the pace a lot, padding out what should have been an eight or 10-hour game into something more like 15 hours. Right when ReCore should be crescendoing towards its conclusion, its pace suddenly sputters instead. It’s Wind Waker syndrome all over again. It doesn’t undo the fun of actually playing it, but these issues keep ReCore from being all that it can be. It doesn’t help that ReCore is also dogged by some technical rough edges. Perhaps its biggest issue, at least on console, is its shoddy overall performance. While a mid or even lower range PC can handle ReCore just fine even at max settings, the Xbox One version rarely if ever manages to make it to 30 fps. It never interfered with my ability to play in any significant manner, but it definitely degrades the visual joy of exploring Far Eden a bit. I didn’t expect ReCore to be quite as big as it is, and from the looks of things, it’s possible its developers didn’t either. Its world, while interesting to explore for a good while, is ultimately too big with too little happening in it to be a totally serviceable housing for the strong combat and platforming gameplay within. It feels like a great, arcadey action platformer spread across too big a canvas, and it asks you to draw back over the same lines a few too many times"
Glenn Wigmore	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	 With NHL 16 having accomplished its mission of righting the ship after the NHL 15 debacle, NHL 17 gets to try out a few new moves. Offline and online users each get something meaty — with a new franchise mode and deep EA Sports Hockey League customization, respectively — and Hockey Ultimate Team fans get some smart upgrades, as well as the new Draft Champions mode. This is a smooth, solid, hard-hitting and feature-rich game that delivers in the ways a modern sports game should. NHL 17 is an appealing revision because of new ways to play as well as improvements to some existing modes, and the game accommodates various skill levels more than ever. Even the tenacity of computer-controlled opposition is upgraded, which is something I haven’t been able to say about certain previous entries in the series. It’s been a pleasure to see the opposing teams use aggressive hitting and a dump-and-chase style of hockey to put the pressure on, as it’s made me (a long-time player of the series) re-evaluate a few strategies. EA seems to be getting quite comfortable with the new engine they debuted a couple of years back, and that confidence has a positive knock-on effect for the whole package.  As you hit the ice you’ll find that this year’s game plays smoothly and crisply, with a good challenge if you want to seek it out. On higher difficulty settings you have less time in general to make decisions, and that pressure makes defensive zone battles feel more crucial. I’d say entering the offensive zone is still a bit too easy, but it can be hard to shake defenders a good deal of the time once you do. The computer also regains the puck too frequently after being poke-checked, but I’ll take this added aggression over some of the passive stuff that was seen in previous NHL games.  On the higher difficulty settings goalies are fairly sharp. Another new angle is that players can now battle in front of the net, which allows bigger forwards to try to establish position in front of the goaltenders. This is useful for creating screens and setting picks. To combat this, the goaltenders have a new set of save animations, which allows goalies to move and react more believably. Goalies will have a distinct resting stance and many of them play positionally, shouldering down pucks and using their frame to cut down the angle. On the higher difficulty settings goalies are fairly sharp, requiring accurate slap shots, one-timers, and wristers to beat them. No obvious “money” goals yet, in other words.  There’s a lot of complexity to all of these interactions, but NHL 17 eases you into them and teaches you to make the most of a situation. A universally welcome feature from NHL 16 was the on-ice trainer, which helped guide newer players through some of the nuances of the controls. This has been enhanced for NHL 17, with added direction from coaches between periods and more on-ice visual aids. It’s nice to see specific zones that your player should be covering, and the projected bank path for saucer passes off the boards is a good touch. The return of “semi-pro” difficulty helps serve as a bridge for casual players, too. Hockey seems very well suited for this type of instruction, and it just makes sense to start novice players with the basics and then occasionally remind them of an advanced technique. The presentation that was revamped two years ago still looks sharp, and it maintains the NHL series’ distinct look among modern sports games, even if there are no noticeable improvements over last year. I still love seeing the mascots dance around and fans getting pumped up after a goal, and the arena-specific items and effects keep that authentic feel. On the other hand, the commentary by Doc Emrick, Eddie Olczyk, and Ray Ferraro doesn’t seem to have much additional variety. Also, the green-screen intros have kind of lost their appeal after the initial professional broadcast sizzle.    NHL has needed this sort of management mode badly for a while now. The “Be A GM” mode has been a staple of the NHL series for years, and last year it was improved via the addition of a morale system which let you monitor your players and meet with them if things started to go awry. NHL 17 has expanded this and gone into full-on owner territory, pulling from the likes of NBA 2K and Madden, to provide full control of a franchise. It’s quite impressive how deep EA went with this feature, as you can adjust the price of individual food items at the concession, launch promotional nights, upgrade stadium facilities, meddle with ticket prices, and even relocate a franchise. All of these systems (including standard features like scouting, roster moves and player morale) interact in multiple ways. I was particularly impressed with the clean explanations of how a franchise’s national exposure, market temperament, and playoff performance would affect ticket sales, for example. Even building upgrades had an impact on how fans would feel about the team. There are limits to this mode, especially when compared with the game-day depth and presentation in Madden or NBA 2K, but NHL has needed this sort of thing badly for a while now. This franchise mode should satisfy those looking to fiddle with ticket prices and work behind the scenes.  For fantasy draft players, the Draft Champions mode (also borrowed from the likes of Madden) gives you the chance to build a team through 12 rounds of drafting. These drafts are themed, so you’ll be picking from the best Canadian players, the brightest young stars, and so on. Once you’ve drafted your team you can challenge players online or take on the computer. I would say that there are a few too many rounds for the choices to feel crucial in these drafts, and maybe limiting it to eight rounds would’ve added more pressure. Still, I do like the idea of making trade-offs while building a team. Rewards earned in Draft Champions feed into the Hockey Ultimate Team mode, where you can continue to collect player cards and build the best possible fantasy team. The big addition this year is the synergy system, which replaces last year’s chemistry dynamic with bonuses awarded for icing players of similar skill types. Also, you can finally do something with all of those unused cards: trade them in as complete sets. These sets unlock premium rewards, including legend cards for specific teams.  This year’s novelty mode is the World Cup of Hockey, which will take place in Toronto in a couple of weeks. All of the international teams are represented, and the in-game overlays and commentary reflect the event. I’m glad the mode is included, but it likely won’t get too much play beyond the first month of release. It feels a bit gimmicky.   Fans of the EA Sports Hockey League were pretty upset when it didn’t make the cut in NHL 15 — and rightfully so — and EA tried to make up for that in NHL 16 by bringing it back with purpose. In NHL 17 teams have even more ways to play thanks to additional player classes to choose from, such as the jumbo playmaker, hitting sniper, and puck-moving defenseman. These classes add to the pre-existing builds, with the puck-moving defenseman helping the transition game and the jumbo playmaker creating a presence for passing lanes, for example.  As your squad levels up in the EASHL, you’ll gain badges and commendations that recognize your achievements. Even cooler are the arena and jersey customization options that unlock; EA really went all in on this feature, adding custom arena types, scoreboards, plexiglass, railings, stairways, goal music, lighting, and more. The team jerseys have customizable coloring and logos that allow for some distinct designs. I would have liked to see more custom logos, as the options are limited that way, but what’s here is a good start. Player goal celebrations are also unlocked through EASHL progression, so you’ll have a number of new ways to humiliate the other team after putting one in the net. My only worry is that some of these options take quite a while to unlock, so the time commitment might scare off some players. Online team play also gets a smart little addition, as you and your friends can now group up before entering matches. Being able to pre-select positions and ready up keeps this experience feeling smooth, and more matches are likely to launch. You can also match up with your EASHL squad for some unranked games, which works well when you’re waiting for the whole team to get online. The action plays smoothly online, as my matches of EASHL, OTP and versus have been clean. There have been reports of the odd freeze for EASHL games, but so far the team I play with hasn’t encountered much of that. A day-one patch has improved some issues I initially had with puck pick-ups, stick-lifts, and poke-checks. I think poke-checks and pick-ups need to be addressed further in a subsequent tuner update, but I’m encouraged with how it’s improved. For my tastes, far-side wristers (and some short-side shots) are far too common against human players, and the action would feel more competitive with those going in at lower frequency. NHL 17 offers such variety that it’s easy to recommend to many players. The continued focus on accessibility and on-ice training fits the series well, and added depth to the EASHL keeps long-time fans like me coming back. The franchise mode finally gives the GM/owner mode a reason to be played, and even Draft Champions, while a bit simplistic, provides a motivation to interact with the Ultimate Team ecosystem. Most importantly, the hockey presented on the ice is dynamic and fluid, and it serves up an excellent version of the fastest game around.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	 Assetto Corsa is a truly triumphant driving simulation. On consoles there’s nothing quite like it, and the fidelity of its incredibly convincing handling really needs to be felt to be believed. Is it the best driving simulator on consoles? Yes; Assetto Corsa is absolutely in a class of its own when it comes to its unflinchingly lifelike physics. But is it the best racing simulator for consoles, ever? No. Not by some margin. Assetto Corsa features a decent mix of cars (ranging from classic open-wheelers to bleeding-edge hypercars) and a modest selection of European tracks but, respectfully, Assetto Corsa wasn’t the best racing simulator released in the week it hit shelves. That distinction actually belongs to Codemasters’ F1 2016. While Assetto Corsa succeeds as a fascinating, highly technical, and massively demanding simulation of real-life driving it largely falls over as a robust racing experience due to a wide mix of baffling and sometimes game-breaking problems.  Assetto Corsa first hit Steam Early Access on PC back in late 2013 and was released officially just over a year later, in late December, 2014. Since then it has accumulated a faithful fanbase and has been regularly supported by developer Kunos Simulazioni and a thriving community of modders. It's surprising, then, that after all this progress its console debut feels unfinished. The most egregious problems occur on track, and the fundamentally flawed penalty system is an especially annoying one. If you get pinged for taking too much curb you’ll earn a ‘slow down’ penalty, but it’s not nuanced enough to let you just drop to and maintain a minimum speed, or simply allow an opponent to redress. You just have to stay off the throttle entirely. Touch the loud pedal, even if you’ve now slowed to a crawl, and the timer will reset. It’s terrible.  There are no consequences for the AI for shunting you off The chief offender, however, is the opponent AI, which regularly pays no mind to your presence on each circuit and is particularly deft at muscling you onto the grass and turning your car around by poking its nose into gaps it really should have thought better of. This is where the top-notch driving dynamics Kunos has massaged into all the available vehicles becomes a double-edged sword, because it takes very little to unsettle your car at speed. Even a mild tap on the rear fender can and will spear you right off the asphalt, and there are no consequences for the AI for shunting you off. Frustratingly, opponent cars seem curiously immune to any loss of control when the shoe is on the other foot. Make a little contact via an overzealous overtake and you’ll generally come off second-best, while the AI peels away unaffected. It’s telling, perhaps, that in Assetto Corsa all I want to do is stay away from other racers entirely, though in its Pan-European peer Project CARS I relish the aggressive, doorhandle-to-doorhandle pack racing. But it’s not just their racing etiquette that is wanting; it’s also their common sense. I’ve raced several events over the past few days where the entire field has entered the pits on the penultimate lap of a four- or six-lap race. I’m totally befuddled by how such a weird bug could survive a trip to retail and it helps make Assetto Corsa’s already chore-like career mode feel even more untested.  Career mode is just a real disappointment. Racing sims like F1 2016 and Project CARS bake in career modes that feel authentic thanks to the fact podium finishes are only a prerequisite for those players who’ve chosen to join the most dominant, in-game race teams. The expectations on everyone else are generally more modest. It makes for far better and far more realistic racing when you know you can spend a whole race dicing for an important mid-pack overtake knowing your team is just after, say, a top 10 finish. Assetto Corsa, on the other hand, feels surprisingly old school; it’s top three or bust. There’s no incentive for me to battle it out with the trailing pack; if I’m not within striking distance of the lead group after a couple of laps I’ll just restart. If the AI wallops me off the track, I’ll restart. If I fluff a braking point and spear off into the gravel, I’ll restart. These restart rituals are the kind of thing I practised commonly back on the early Gran Turismo and Forza Motorsport games but since then other racing sims have matured to feature career modes that make you feel like you’re competing as a real race driver. Assetto Corsa’s racing career is really just a fractured series of vanilla assessments you have to complete successfully before moving up to the next one.  The tracks have a nice, real-life, worn feel to them, especially the battered curbs There is a second way to approach Assetto Corsa and that’s via its ‘Special Events’, although these are just one-off versions of events the career mode is already full of (quick races, time trials, and hot laps). The only meaningful difference here is that they can be tackled in any order you want (career mode progression is very linear in comparison). Assetto Corsa’s overall presentation is mixed. I love the highly-detailed and fully-functioning car interiors, and I didn’t really notice too many startling visual hitches while racing with my preferred dash view. The frame rate definitely wavers on both PS4 and Xbox One when duking it out with the maximum 15 opponents, though, and AI cars are also driverless for some reason (the cars pilot themselves around the track empty but drivers will be displayed in them during replays). I also dislike the strobing effect of brake lights, which makes me feel like I’m at a rave rather than a racetrack. I think the sound is mostly good; missing a bit of the ferocity of something like Project CARS (with its ear-bashing exhaust crackle and immersive chassis flex squeaks) but certainly leagues beyond Gran Turismo (though some cars are less convincing than others). The game’s also got a vibrant colour palette which feels a little more natural than some of its slightly washed-out competitors and, while they aren’t particularly eye-popping, the tracks have a nice, real-life, worn feel to them, especially the battered curbs.  Its menu interface, however, is a real dud. I rapidly grew tired of the unintuitive shuffling required to move around this game. Backing out of an individual career event option? You won’t be taken back to the previous menu, with other events to choose from; you’ll be taken straight back to the main career mode tiers. It’s a completely unnecessary extra step backwards. The menus are also currently peppered with cars and events from the existing PC version that are purportedly DLC here on the console version, but when I click on them they’re apparently not available right now. Uh, cool. What I dislike more, though, is the game’s indifferent attitude to you finishing an event. Pass the chequered flag, either online or offline, and after a few seconds you’ll be teleported to your pit box – watching as AI or human opponents pop into existence behind you. It’s jarring and daft. You just sit there until the results screen pops up, and then you quit the race. It’s anticlimactic and unintuitive, and it makes the game feel unpolished.  The force feedback is spot-on and the feel of being able to jolt over harsh curbs and truly teeter on the very edge of control is just terrific It’s at its worst online as, once a race is over, you’ll just sit in the pits until you quit, or everyone else leaves and the event restarts. It’s a weird feeling, playing a game that often feels apathetic to the fact you’re actually in it. Continuing the menu malarkey, when you quit an online race you’re not taken back to the online race browser – you’re dumped back out in the main game’s ‘Drive’ menu, where you need to select ‘Online’ again to re-join. Sadly there isn’t a great deal of reasons to race online right now anyway. The racing is serviceable enough when you can get one, but I can rarely find any players racing in the pre-set hoppers and you can’t create your own events. Assetto Corsa really only works as a single-player hot lapping experience for players with a wheel. I am actually pleasantly surprised at how well Kunos has adapted the game’s incredibly hard-core handling scheme to a controller (even at its default sensitivity settings it’s less twitchy and unforgiving than I’d expected, and there’s even an auto-throttle blip that will help keep the car composed as you downshift) but you really require a wheel to experience the best of what Assetto Corsa has to offer. I’ve been playing it with a Logitech G29 and, when it’s just me against the physics, it’s genuinely brilliant. The force feedback is spot-on and the feel of being able to jolt over harsh curbs and truly teeter on the very edge of control is just terrific.  Elsewhere, however, Assetto Corsa just can’t make much of a case for itself, especially for less-experienced racers. Don’t bother turning on the driving line; it’s not dynamic so the braking points are always wrong (considering the racing line will appear in your replays too it’s basically as if it’s been painted on the track). Don’t bother using the chase cam, either; I’m terrible at using chase cams for racing sims at the best of times but the rigid camera on this one seems especially irksome. Also, the difficulty is really uneven; the time trials are a doddle but the racing starts ruthless and just gets harder. I like challenging and unforgiving racing games – it’s one of the reasons I’m transfixed by Dirt Rally – but there’s challenging and unforgiving, and there’s poorly optimised. With no night racing, no weather effects, a fairly narrow selection of circuits, fewer cars on track, no pit engineer communication or decent race-day atmosphere – all in addition to the issues I’ve described above – I just can’t recommend Assetto Corsa on console over more robust race sims like F1 2016 or Project CARS. Despite its amazing driving simulation, Assetto Corsa just doesn’t get the racing right. Out on track alone it feels amazing; there’s no denying the remarkable realism Kunos Simulazioni has captured here. Unfortunately the team just hasn’t been able to wrap a comprehensive or competitive racing experience around it this time.
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/24/valley-review	 Like a modern Sonic The Hedgehog game, Valley’s run-and-jump gameplay is a whole lot of fun when you’re going fast, but the moment it slows you down it’s dull and annoying. Over its four hours this happens far too often: to expose you to a storyline that has no stakes or stakeholders, to explore its colorful but empty world, or to fight painfully repetitive battles. It’s hard to get invested when there’s little to care about, and the gameplay never provides any of the addictive challenge it really needs. Valley’s first-person, mech-suit-powered platforming gets its excitement from playing with momentum - running down a hill will pick up speed, letting you launch yourself across colossal gaps. It’s a thrill that has you look at the world in a different way - there could be a hill you can speed your way down, just to be flung off of a jump at the very bottom, landing you safely on a platform that looked unreachable from the ground. In those fast-paced sequences, you feel a whole lot like a superhero, but sometimes Valley’s own mechanics have a habit of ruining them.   If you’ve built up speed and then you hit a corner, you’re abruptly slowed down by the walls around you while you try to turn, no matter how hard you try to avoid them. It’s like it can’t keep up with its own speed. A few of those glorious jumps end in poorly thought out locations, too, abruptly ripping your speed from you by landing right in front of a rock that you couldn’t have possibly seen and avoided from the sky.  It can't keep up with its own speed.  All of those gameplay moments take place in large but linear environments, though, and are unfortunately spaced apart by long sequences of walking through tight hallways in dull facilities, uncovering a story through the audio files of two long-dead characters who are dealing with a struggle that’s very hard to care about, as well as some notes scattered around the world. The history of the area is breadcrumbed out for you slowly enough to be a little enticing, and it is full of curious mysteries with a solid foundation of lore, but considering you’re the sole person in the valley there are absolutely no stakes. Everything and everyone you’re learning about is already gone, and if you hadn’t shown up the Valley would’ve remained untouched, so you don’t have much to fight for. Valley’s coolest idea, and a fairly intelligently addressed ethical issue in the story, actually kicks in when you die: every death makes the world around you shift and die a little, too, and that leaves a lasting sense of responsibility. Dying takes away from the Valley’s overall health, since it was used to bring you back to life again, and if all of the trees die, you lose the ability to respawn. That would be a very clever way of representing a health bar if it didn’t deplete by a seemingly random amount every time you die, making it difficult to read, and if Valley weren’t so pointlessly easy.   There are very few challenges that are actually likely to kill you, and the energy pickups that power your suit (and represent your health and ammunition) are so plentiful that I actually had to try to die, just to see the outcome. My most common cause of death was mistaking water for a rock and jumping into it and drowning, which I feel pretty content blaming the art style for rather than a semblance of difficulty.  I actually had to try to die.  I wished for more hazards, though, because as the trees around me died the interesting visual evolution teamed with the ability to replenish health by giving those trees your own energy is encouragement enough to explore the world, and as long as you’re outdoors it is usually pretty. The trees are bright pink or bright orange, certain mushrooms in caves glow, and one specific area has the sky lit up by an Aurora Borealis - it’s varied and colorful, but feels unfortunately empty. There are a few collectibles but no characters and very little ambient life except for a few deer - how are we supposed to worry about a world dying if there’s no life in it?   There are some weak combat sequences that seem to be randomly dumped throughout the campaign, too, but they’re just as uninteresting. They’re fought against two enemy types who attack in the exact same way and are dealt with in the exact same way: strafe to easily avoid their slow-moving attacks and shoot your own slow-moving attacks. If you see an enemy, firing off three quick shots will kill them before they even seem to notice that you’re there, or you can just keep running and pretend you never encountered them at all, because they’re too slow to hit you - that’s how little impact they have. There’s no variety outside of a single easy boss fight, and even that boss looks the same as Enemy Type Number Two. Every fight feels identical to the last, and the last wasn’t fun to begin with.  There’s no variety outside of a single boss fight  The one new mechanic that’s introduced to mix things up is a hook that lets you attach to things that are roped between trees, but instead of letting you swing freely between them like Spider-Man, they control the direction you move in. You can’t tell where it’s going to swing you before you attach, so you’re forced to slow down and make note, rather than flying between them yourself. In moments of immense speed, Valley’s basic first-person platforming creates some excitement. But those are just moments, and they’re spaced too far apart with empty environments and forgettable combat between them. There are some interesting ideas scattered throughout the world but they’re very hard to care about, since there’s nobody around to be influenced by your actions. A seemingly pointless resource management system presents some interesting aesthetics, but overall, Valley very rarely presents the challenge or consequence it really needs to be addictive.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	 There are just five laps to go of the 57-lap 2016 Bahrain Grand Prix and I’ve got about enough fuel for four and change. Complicating matters even further, my tyres are on the brink of ruin – specifically my front left, which I’ve been loading up and brutalising around every one of Bahrain’s beefy right-handers. I need to make a call: pit now and lose a few spots I won’t have time to claw back, or go for broke and risk it all. Ninety minutes of racing have reached a dramatic crescendo: a white-knuckle dash to the finish line in a car that may or may not make it. This is brilliant stuff. In just my second career race F1 2016 has swallowed me up in its Formula One fantasy. Furiously fast, satisfyingly stressful, and utterly exhausting, F1 2016 isn’t just Codemasters’ best F1 game to date – it may just be the best F1 racer ever.   Back in Bahrain I’m losing grip and the sharpness has gone from the steering. Jeff, my race engineer, wants me to pit because he knows as well as I do that a puncture is imminent; a similar scenario last round at Melbourne turned my scrappy top-10 finish into a disappointing 17th as I limped around the last sector of Albert Park and sheepishly slunk into the pits with just a single lap to go. The difference here, however, is that I’m in the lead with a several second gap back to Nico Rosberg in his purportedly untouchable Merc. I dial down the fuel to its leanest setting, tell Jeff to shut up via the handy voice commands, and focus on making my car as wide as possible. Rosberg closes fast but I shut the door on him on every bend. The straights are trickier to defend but slowly tracing from one side of the road to the other before darting back over, just inside the racing line, seems to be stopping him from galloping past me in the DRS zones. I stay ahead long enough to pass the chequered flag in P1 after an hour and a half of total focus. My tyres are trash and there’s less than a quarter of a lap’s worth of fuel left over, but top spot on the podium is secured – the perfect end to a successful race weekend. F1 2016 has made its case, and it’s definitely worth the aching hands afterwards.   Codemasters has always felt like a fine home for the F1 franchise but, in its haste to bring the series to the current generation of consoles F1 2015 was a step backwards. It felt good, but it was significantly lacking elsewhere. F1 2016 redresses that, improving on last year’s slender package in so many ways it’s tough to choose where to start. The re-addition of a proper, full-fat career mode is the big one, providing F1 2016 with a huge injection of context and immersion. Also, the return of the safety car means entire races can change in an instant, perhaps by destroying your lead margin, or perhaps by putting you back in touch with the pointy end of the pack.  Codemasters has always felt like a fine home for the F1 franchise But it’s also the smaller enhancements that combine to help make F1 2016 Codemasters’ best take on track racing since the TOCA days. The new formation lap is an addition I didn’t even know I wanted until Codemasters gave it to us here, and I love it. Weaving about, warming up the tyres and brakes for the race; it’s fantastic and adds considerably to the race-day atmosphere. It’s a rare moment of non-competitive calm in a genre where that isn’t a common occurrence, and it’s an especially terrific contrast to the ferocity on the grid when the lights go out. Manual starts and manual braking for pit lane are other ways for inclined players to shoulder more on-track responsibility. The bustling hospitality areas, the setting for the off-track side of F1 2016’s career mode, are scattered with recognisable faces from the world of real-life Formula 1. (This behind-the-scenes hub will also give you your first glimpse of the weather for an upcoming session; rain trickling down the glass is a heads up that it could be a gnarly one). Newly added wheel tethers mean wrecks are more realistic-looking than ever, with loose wheels slapping against the monocoque and shattered suspension arms. Turn on the new simulation damage setting, which makes cars realistically fragile, and it’s something you’ll probably be seeing a lot of.   Hell, if you can spare a glance to the side as you blast down each of the main straights you’ll even spot pit boards being dangled over the pit wall and hoisted back as the drivers zip past. On its own that’s simply a small visual flourish many people may not even notice, but when you do it’s evidence that no detail was too trivial. F1 2016, then, feels like a proper F1 game for proper F1 fans, created by the most dedicated F1 die-hards Codemasters could muster. It’s been built with a wide range of players in mind, too. You’re free to sign up with any team in the championship from day one, meaning everyone’s covered - from those who want to jump straight into a competitive car and grab podiums to those who want to start on the bottom rung slogging it out amongst the cellar-dwellers. The standard suite of driving aids and race settings is again on hand to assist racers of all skill levels, and F1 2016 is nothing if not malleable. Race settings can be adjusted between each GP (meaning you’re not locked into a certain race length or opponent proficiency for an entire season) and hardcore features like formation laps aren’t just reserved for veteran players who shun traction control and ABS like Dracula dodging a garlic crucifix; they can be toggled on regardless of what overall difficulty you require or how many assists you prefer activated.   F1 2016 also impresses by actually incentivising participation in practice sessions, tying success here to your car’s overall development. It’s important to research car upgrades because the rest of field will be doing the same thing, so ignoring them will see your team become further and further outclassed. There are three programmes to run (track acclimatisation, tyre preservation tests, and qualifying trim runs), and though you don’t have to run them all (they do get a little samey) it’s definitely worthwhile checking them out as often as you can manage. The tyre conservation assessments were particularly good at giving me a real-time glimpse at just how harsh my racing style is on my rubber, although I did grow a little weary of completing one before every GP. In full-length sessions the tyre test alone goes for 10 laps, and they can become chore-like.  The new highlight in terms of tracks is obviously the brand-new street circuit through the Azerbaijani capital of Baku The new highlight in terms of tracks is obviously the brand-new street circuit through the Azerbaijani capital of Baku, a intimidatingly unforgiving, high-speed monster peppered with blind 90 degree corners and an unexpectedly narrow uphill chicane that will keep even the sternest F1 legends up at night. Yet even the entrenched circuits that have been a part of the series since Codemasters first began building it have been given a new lease on life thanks to ability to fine-tune the time-of-day settings. Ever wonder what the Singapore GP would look like as a day race? F1 2016 will bring it to life for you. There’s still a disappointing drabness to the overall colour palette when it comes to the environments but the velocity at which everything whips by means I usually struggle to absorb much of my surroundings anyway. The presentation elsewhere remains very good, although there are a few cheeky shortcuts (such as the celebratory podium vignettes, which are recycled from F1 2015). Depressingly I’m yet to come across one featuring Dan Ricciardo chugging champagne from his race boot.   On track F1 2016 feels as competent as ever; planted and responsive. There’s a simple game here for racers who just want to get in and go, go, go, and an incredibly demanding one for those with the minerals to tackle Monaco in the pouring rain without any electronic helpers. Wet-weather handling is more devilish here than it was in last year’s iteration and overall it seems a little less forgiving on oversteer, though more so on a controller than on a wheel. There’s no split-screen play, sadly, but 22-player multiplayer is featured for the first time for those who revel in the potential bedlam of online racing. For mine, the more disciplined AI racers are far and away my preferred opponents; they make the odd absurd error but for the most part they show good situational awareness and will give you space if you force the issue. F1 2016 is definitively the best Formula One game Codemasters has ever crafted. Deep and nuanced, stuffed with fan service, and as demanding as you’d like it to be, this is worthy fare for the motorsport obsessed while remaining accessible for the merely curious, and absolutely worth the upgrade from previous years. If F1 2016 and last year’s Dirt Rally are indicative of the level of quality we’re going to get from Codemasters going forward I can’t wait to see what’s next.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/19/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review	 Any game bearing the Deus Ex name sets a high bar for itself, and yet, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided clears it handily. The followup to Deus Ex: Human Revolution retains the strong gameplay blueprint of choice-driven stealth and RPG elements that defines the series, but its superlative map and mission designs elevate it to new highs. Mankind Divided’s gorgeously realized version of Prague is deeply infused with meaty, multi-part quests that give you plenty of chances to leverage its toy chest of cool gadgets and abilities. Its story is just slightly limited in scope compared to the far-reaching conspiracies the plot often alludes to, but in terms of raw gameplay, this is the best the series has ever been.  Even more so than its predecessors, this iteration of Deus Ex succeeds in making me feel like a cybernetically enhanced super agent that no security system can withstand. A handful of powerful, sexy new experimental augments that you can wire into grizzled cyborg protagonist Adam Jensen are at least partially to thank for that. The energy-draining Titan Armor ripples angrily as it shrugs off everything from bullets to grenades, the Tesla Arm attachment locks onto and incapacitates multiple targets at range, and when someone absolutely needs to die immediately, the arm-mounted nanoblade launcher pierces flesh and armor alike - knocking its target clean off their feet and pinning the corpse to the nearest wall with tremendous force. They’d almost be too powerful if not for the associated energy and ammo costs that come with them, which are fine-tuned so that I wasn’t too shy to use one, while still feeling a little bit special every time I did.   These deviously fun gadgets would be good on their own, but it’s the thoughtfully crafted environments that tease out their true potential. For instance, the Icarus Dash allows you to cover short distances in the blink of an eye, which makes it a fine escape tool. It’s also a great gap-closer for swiftly knocking out guards from a few paces out. But it wasn’t until I started noticing subtle new routes I could take towards objectives that I was sold on it. I once used it to dash across a series of rafters high above an entire roomful of enemies with none of them the wiser. More often, I used it to dash directly from ground level up to a second-story window.  That particular use synergizes perfectly with the Remote Hacking aug, which is probably the most transformative upgrade. Experimenting with it allows you to manipulate everything from laser grids and mines to ladders and window shutters, opening up whole new possibilities I had no idea were there upon first glance. What’s the answer? Hint: there isn’t one – there are TEN.  Remote hacking a second-floor window shutter and then Icarus Dashing up to it became my favorite one-two punch of stealthy infiltration, granting me easy access to more than a few places where the front door wasn’t an option. This harmonious relationship between mechanics and environmental design extends to the returning augments as well, lending a sense of value and purpose to even the most basic-seeming of upgrades. Being able to leap, sneak, muscle, or hack my way into almost anywhere wouldn’t mean much if there wasn’t anything there worth discovering, but my feats of high-tech infiltration were always rewarded in one way or another. An innocent-looking curio shop might have a secret passage leading to a storage locker full of valuable items, or sneaking through a neighboring apartment might lead to you stumbling into one of the meaty multi-part sidequests. It’s a little surprising that Eidos Montreal is willing to allow us to overlook these if we don’t search thoroughly enough, because in terms of complexity and design these optional adventures are no less sophisticated than the main quest-line. You won’t find any simple hit jobs or fetch quests here; these are long-form assignments with lots of moving parts, and they require you to find one of several possible solutions at every step.  They usually begin simply, with a random email I’d read on a laptop I’d hacked or a shady police officer claiming I didn’t have the proper papers to get through a checkpoint. Three steps later I’m breaking up a kidnapping and extortion racket or sneaking into an underground drug lab to put an end to it. Do I have the Social Enhancement aug to convince a lab worker to help me shut down their manufacturing machines? If I don’t, how do I even get to them, seeing as they are gated off by a high fence that’s locked behind a computer keypad with maximum hacking defense? Even if I got past that, there’s arrays of infrared sensors, cameras, and an automated sentry turret all overlapping each other’s sight lines. What’s the answer? Hint: there isn’t one – there are TEN. Missions are meticulously designed, like an interlocking matrix of questions with a bevy of interesting answers.  That keypad? You could hack it if you’ve put enough points into that aug, though it would be a crazy hack given how much more interesting the expanded hacking mini-game has become. But with some luck and a healthy stack of the right hacking software, you could pull it off. Don’t have the skills or the software? Bust out a multi-tool - a rare one-time-use item that can hack anything in a jiffy. No multi-tool? Craft one with some spare parts. Ah, no spare parts, huh? Did you check that lab assistant’s computer? Oh, you’re hacking is THAT bad? No sweat, just start luring in and knocking out guards until you find one that’s got the code for the keypad on him. Nice work! Except, that was just the keypad. Almost every mission is this meticulously designed, like an interlocking matrix of questions with a bevy of interesting answers…and Mankind Divided never stops asking.   None of this would work if Mankind Divided weren’t enjoyable to actually play, but developer Eidos Montreal has made many smart improvements to the moment-to-moment experience since Human Revolution. A new cover-to-cover movement system and the ability to mantle up ledges, for instance, make getting around much smoother. The UI also does a much better job of informing you when you’ve been seen, who sees you, and how close you are to inciting a gunfight. Additionally, some of the stealth-assistance augs that were optional in Human Revolution, like the ability to see a projection of your last known location or to have enemies appear on the mini-map without having to visually acquire them, are now given to you for free (a nice change from the usual sequel approach of de-powering the hero back to base levels, which Mankind Divided cleverly sidesteps). These are subtle choices, but taken as a whole they remove most of the guessing and hoping that made Human Revolution’s stealth occasionally frustrating. Even better, when things do escalate gunplay feels precise, and resetting the situation after setting off an alarm is much more manageable. Where in Human Revolution being seen would almost invariably plunge encounters into total chaos, Mankind Divided allows a well equipped and prepared player to feel powerful even when bullets begin to fly. The new Crysis-style on-the-fly weapon modification plays a big role here, adding a ton of utility and flexibility to standard firearms. By quickly attaching a silencer, swapping the holo-scope for a 4X optical, and switching between full-auto to semi-auto firing modes, my mid-range spray-and-pray combat rifle could become a silent, serviceable sniper rifle in seconds. Finally, shooting no longer feels like something I’m not supposed to do in a Deus Ex game. Finally, shooting no longer feels like something I’m not supposed to do.  The only real criticism I can level at Mankind Divided is that, especially in the wake of the events that close Human Revolution, its plot is decidedly less ambitious. It’s still well produced (barring slightly suspect lip-syncing) with dutiful, believable performances by the entire voice cast, but the story feels like it’s stuck in second gear. Rather than a steady ramping up of ever bigger and more ominous threats, the 20- to 30-hour campaign remains tightly focused on discovering the truth behind a bombing that occurs right off the bat. Over the course of the investigation it becomes clear there are larger forces at play, but unlike Human Revolution or the original Deus Ex, Mankind Divided never really follows that breadcrumb trail to the darkest corners of the cyberpunk world. It ends up feeling more like a first episode of a potentially great TV show rather than a complete feature-length film in that sense.   Completely independent of the story campaign, Breach is a nifty little extra mode you can hit for a quick, short fix of Deus Ex-ish style gameplay in a VR-themed world. As time-trial modes go, Breach has a lot going for it: a striking visual style, unique augs and abilities exclusive to the mode, and leaderboards to compete on for record times. It’s by no means revelatory, but it’s a welcome addition and a nice way to get that cybernetic badass rush in short, quick bursts while leveraging the same excellent mechanics that make the core game great. Aside from the smaller-feeling plot, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided improves upon its excellent predecessor in every other way. Its impeccably designed environments are flush with possibility, remaining completely coherent while supporting a wide variety of routes and character builds, and Jensen’s prodigious new feats of techno-wizardry add new dimension to both combat and exploration. Mankind Divided never stopped challenging me or rewarding my curiosity, which pushed me to thoroughly explore its beautiful, ruined world while carefully weighing my decisions along the way.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/18/hitman-episode-4-bangkok-review	 Hotels are perfect locations for Hitman games. Squeezing a large number of living spaces, entertainment areas, and utilitarian facilities like kitchens and basements and such into a single building results in an environment brimming with gameplay potential. Hitman Episode 4: Bangkok is no exception to this rule, taking 47 to Southeast Asia for a fun, two-target hit at a luxury riverside Thai resort dubbed the Himmapan.  Hotels are perfect locations for Hitman games. I’d actually expected something a little more densely-packed, with narrow, branching halls and lower ceilings (something that better emulated the slightly more cramped and intimate feel of a real hotel). A place more along the lines of the Hungarian hotel featured in the memorable Hitman: Codename 47/Hitman Contracts mission ‘Traditions of the Trade’, for instance. As it stands there really doesn’t feel like there are even close to enough rooms in this Thai hotel to support the multiple bars and lounges, as well as its large restaurant. (To be honest it feels like there’s more armed security in the Himmapan than there are actual suites.)  I’m nonetheless happy with Episode 4, though, and this level is definitely a step up from Episode 3’s undercooked Marrakesh. It’s smaller and more self-contained than the sprawling Sapienza, which remains the pick of the bunch, but Episode 4’s sumptuous Himmapan is still very interesting to explore, from the verdant lobby where vines climb the walls to the well-appointed penthouse, and the several levels in between.  The targets are probably the most rewarding victims to date. It also helps that the targets are probably the most rewarding victims to date: a spoilt singer who recently got away with murder, and the slimy family lawyer who made that happen. As per usual, each of them can be offed in a lengthy list of varyingly-hideous ways. At this stage in Hitman’s polarising release cadence some of these methods are becoming rather played-out (I’ve definitely lost track of how many people I’ve drowned in toilets) but there are still enough unique opportunities here in Himmapan for plenty of playthroughs. Be sure to stop by singer Jordan Cross’ birthday party; he’s turning 27, which is a notoriously dangerous age to be a rock star.  I encountered more sound bugs related to dialogue delivery in Episode 4 than I have previously, with the odd word skipping like a trashed CD and, on one occasion, a previously-played conversation between 47 and the concierge repeating for no reason when I returned later to pass within a few metres of the front desk. The incongruous accents also remain an unwelcome fart released into Hitman’s otherwise satisfying atmosphere, but at least here a large portion of the NPCs are either tourists or part of a travelling US rock band’s entourage, recording team, or private security. The high prevalence of American and English accents deep in the heart of Thailand is far less grating when justified by a small nugget of context. Hitman Episode 4: Bangkok gets proceedings back on track after the somewhat bland Marrakesh malarkey of Episode 3. The Himmapan resort may lack the size and scope of Sapienza, and it isn’t quite the classic Hitman hotel level I was after, but it still boasts plenty of problem solving and murderous mayhem within its walls.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	 If it’s anything like mine, your Xbox One’s Kinect has sat unceremoniously in a cupboard for months, the most recent addition to an unnervingly large pile of abandoned tech. It was a pleasure, then, to discover that Fru’s surprisingly hard and very fun challenges made bringing the Kinect out of storage worth it. If more games had explored clever uses of the sensor like this puzzle-platformer does, I’d never have put it away. That’s a big call. Fru’s setup makes for a hilarious and occasionally ridiculous three-hour experience. On initial examination, Fru is a simple platformer that sees you controlling a small, waif-like girl across blocky terrain with your controller. Its point of difference is you, your silhouette, which appears on screen and within its frame reveals an alternate-dimension landscape of the level, allowing you to change its makeup in order to advance your character through it.  While I felt eventually exhausted by all the body contortion required to cover the right parts of the screen with my silhouette - and more than a little mortified when I had an audience - Fru’s puzzles grew smarter and more complex as I made my way through, compelling me to continue. Each of the four chapters changes the way you play considerably, so I went from using my body to reveal hidden puzzles to creating a pathway through a building with a bent knee to blocking out pools of lava with my outstretched arm while trying to manage a carefully timed jump with the controller gripped in my left hand. Fru is devilishly difficult in its later stages, which makes for genuine fist-pumping moments when you progress, inch by inch. These puzzles worked best when the solution was initially obtuse, but careful exploration of the level and the various ways my body interacted with it revealed the answer. I experienced a wonderful sense of discovery as Fru teased out its possibilities, like the realization I could lift the little girl slowly up with my head, or catch her in a pool of water with my hand at the last second of a blind leap. These moments felt genuinely revelatory and made for a warm sense of intimacy, as it’s hard not to feel protective of the character when you’re interacting with her so physically.  Fru is less successful when it boils down to a physical challenge. While rare, whenever the goal seems to be “how extravagantly can you contort your body while still using the controller?” it's not quite as fun as Fru's more cerebral challenges - though contorting myself into a human pretzel did make an entertaining show for onlookers. The Kinect handles whatever Fru throws at it. Extremely precise motions - the extension of a finger, for example - are reflected back on screen, as are sudden movements. My silhouette was so well captured I had to take off items of clothing to avoid my sleeve accidentally hitting something it shouldn’t; perhaps another reason Fru is a game best played with the door shut and the curtains closed. An example of what the Kinect can do when used creatively, Fru is a remarkably fun and hilarious puzzle-platformer that demands as much from your body as it does your mind. It’s bittersweet that it arrived so late to the party.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	" I don't expect the apocalypse to be pretty—the very word conjures images of a world shorn of its good looks and comforts and where everything normal has been turned on its head. Rarely do we see that concept interpreted quite so literally as we do in the new console versions of 7 Days to Die, which is apocalyptic both in its setting and its implementation. I saw pigs tumbling up steep cliffs on the tips of their snouts in defiance of gravity. I saw rabbits bouncing inside of trees and corpses wiggling around on the pavement until they disappeared underground. This zombie-themed survival game with a heavy emphasis on crafting may have a bunch of good ideas, but everything about the way they’re presented here make it impossible to recommend.  Like nearly every multiplayer game, if you can convince a couple of friends to unwisely spend 30 bucks and endure its troubles with you cooperatively, you’ll find trace amounts of fun in this broken wasteland. 7 Days to Die, for all of its rotting zombies and splashes of blood, resembles nothing so much as Minecraft: the object is to run around bashing everything from rocks to trees to signs—with your fists, at first—and using those resources to build everything from stone axes and clothes to toilets and mailboxes. The twist? A timer ticks up all the while, and every seven in-game days a horde of zombies (with not nearly enough character models to go around) descends upon the world to raise hell for those who haven't spent that week prepping for the inevitable attack. Should you survive, the struggle continues into the next week and the next week until, presumably, you start having deep philosophical discussions with yourself about the whole point of survival.  The framerates collapse and rise again, zombie-like. Perhaps I would have enjoyed myself more if the world still had some beauty to counterbalance its sorrows. There are places, such as the desert's expanses of yucca and prickly pear, where 7 Days to Die achieves a degree of realistic detail, but on the whole the world that unfolds on the Xbox One looks ancient and unappealing. Fog obscures distances everywhere, limiting views to a few hundred yards at best. Some of the maps, particularly those in the randomized worlds, look like rough drafts that accidentally made it from a developer's trash folder and into the final release. All the while the framerates collapse and rise again, zombie-like, the action freezes completely during the most mundane tasks, and the multiplayer maps sometimes shut down entirely without warning. I got the most fun out of 7 Days to Die, I think, just from guessing when the next glitch would pop up. I usually didn't have to wait long. It's the kind of thing you'd expect to find on a PC game on Steam's Early Access.  So it should come as no surprise that even with 7 Days to Die's shiny, disclaimer-free boxed copies for the PS4 and Xbox One, that's essentially what it is. It's been around for PC since 2013 on Steam, and there it's still listed as Early Access and its patches still come out labeled as ""alphas."" Bug sweeps and improvements to graphics have made the PC version decent enough, at least, but the console version plays like an alpha of that alpha.  Why do I have to use the thumbsticks like a mouse pointer in order to select things in the menus? Even the most basic concessions to console controls have been overlooked. Why, for instance, do I have to use the thumbsticks like a mouse pointer in order to select things in the menus? Other, similar interface issues constantly muddle the experience, constantly reminding me I’m not using the right tool for this job. The action – such as it is – works well enough, but fiddling with menus usually presents a greater struggle than offing the zombies. Mind you, the action only works sort of well when you graduate to using weapons like bows and arrows or guns — when it's just punching rocks or swinging axes, it's barely better than Minecraft’s rudimentary bludgeoning. It’s hard to tell if you’re fighting a zombie or harvesting it. Sometimes the zombies continue to stand there wiggling after you've shot them full of arrows, making it hard to tell if they're still ""alive"" or just glitched. To be clear, there's a decent game under all of this cruft that PC players have enjoyed for years, it’s just that that average-at-best game has been completely crippled by a bad console port. When I closed my eyes and imagined controls that weren’t a trainwreck, I found myself pulled in by the idea that almost everything in the world can be broken down and used to craft something else, and the approach encourages a great deal of experimentation that's appropriate for a setting focused on working with what you have. (It was experimentation, in fact, that led me to start punching rocks with my fists to get my first stones; the tutorial quests say nothing about that.) There's also a Minecraft-style Creative mode that turns off the zombie hordes and lets you focus solely on building, although I found it most useful for figuring out the basics without worrying about a yet another jerkily animated, copy-pasted zombie interrupting my creative reveries. Again, it's best to enjoy this with friends, and there's even a splitscreen local co-op mode if you don't relish the idea of joining the multiplayer maps where you may not even see another person. And, if you do, they'll probably want to kill you for your stuff anyway. There's a hint of a good game in 7 Days to Die's mix of zombie attack preparedness and crafting and cooperative stands against zombies, and it has valuable ideas to contribute to the genre. In fact, you can almost hear them screaming to escape from beneath terrible graphics, barely useable menu controls, and shoddy console optimization. This is an apocalypse amongst apocalypses."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	 Overwatch exists at an intersection between design and artistry, a crossroad at which pure tactile joy meets refined, intelligent design to create a rare spark of magic. As a 6v6 multiplayer, objective-based shooter, it finds accessibility not by lowering the skill ceiling, but by broadening the definition of skill. The person with deadshot aim is no more valuable than the person with the decision-making ability to know when a well-timed ability will turn an engagement, or the person with the map-sense to find the optimal locations to place sentry turrets. While it didn't exactly drown me in options, maps, and modes, it’s blessed with a multitude of tactical layers, and none of them ever came between me and my enjoyment of its intense, swirling teamfights, and thrilling overtime comebacks. Update: Overwatch is IGN's 2016 Game of the Year. Overwatch does a great many things well, but above all else, its success is built on the backs of its many excellent characters. It’s fitting that the main menu is dominated by one of them at all times; their diverse appearances, origins, and personalities are all laid bare with every pose they strike. Reinhardt’s rocket hammer lands on his shoulder with a meaty clank that invokes a broadsword resting against a medieval knight’s plate armor, and Tracer’s jovial smile is just briefly interrupted by a rebellious bang that slides across her face, tempting her to blow it back into place before re-addressing the camera and blinking all over the place. There’s an intelligent gorilla scientist, a lithe, blue-skinned assassin, and a cybernetic, zen-practicing healer too. It speaks volumes that the one character that adheres to well-worn shooter tropes feels like the odd man out here. They’re all so different that you’d imagine them looking silly standing next to one another, but through careful, subtle visual cues baked into their equipment and attire, they manage to appear as if they share a common world, even if they all hail from different corners of it. It speaks volumes that the one character that adheres to well-worn shooter tropes feels like the odd man out here.  This diversity continues to bear out when you pick a hero and hit the battlefield with them. Though the 21 characters (all of whom are unlocked from the start) are roughly grouped into one of four “roles,” no two feel alike. The robotic, transforming Bastion and the anarchic, explosive-tossing Junkrat are both technically Defenders, but they couldn’t play any more differently from one another. The former looks for a cozy spot overlooking a key choke point and transforms into a minigun turret to run point defense; the latter plays an area-denial game by lobbing timed grenades over long distances, which then sit on the ground blinking angrily, as if to say “go somewhere else” to encroaching enemies before exploding. This strong sense of differentiation is important because it keeps team composition strategies from devolving into simple formulas. No, two Tanks, two Supports, and two Attackers is not the magic solution for a winning team. You have to look much deeper – and when you do, the true beauty of Overwatch’s gameplay shines through.   One of the surprising keys to surfacing these nuances is its refusal to offer up crutches to lean on. With very few arguable exceptions, no character is focused solely around one catch-all gun or skill to the extent that you can find success by using it alone. Tracer’s dual machine-pistols have a high rate of fire but poor accuracy, a short clip, and middling damage if you aren’t scoring headshots. Genji’s shurikens are highly damaging and boast unerring accuracy, but their slow rate of fire and long travel time can make hitting a small moving target difficult. Almost every primary weapon fits this mold: they’re useful, and in the right situation quite powerful, but never versatile enough to be a security blanket to constantly cling to. Not only do these little details help differentiate characters, they pushed me to explore their other abilities in search of success. You have to look much deeper – and when you do, the true beauty of Overwatch’s gameplay shines through.  And once I started looking more closely, I couldn’t stop discovering new things. Revisiting Junkrat’s toolset, he doesn’t have a single standard, reliable gun to just directly engage an enemy in front of him. Sure, he could skip grenades along the ground, leading his target as best he can, but even if you were good enough to reliably win one-on-one firefights this way, you wouldn’t be realizing his full potential. At face value his other two skills – Steel Trap and Concussion Mine – seem straightforward. One immobilizes enemies that wander into it, the other blows them sky-high when triggered. In practice though, they can be so much more. Steel Trap can be an escape tool, allowing you to disengage from fights with faster enemies trying to get in your face. Its positional alert upon being triggered allows it to double as an early warning system too, letting you know that someone on the other team is attempting to flank your defenses and holding them there long enough for you to respond. Or, plant a Concussion Mine on top of a Steel Trap and just detonate it when you see it triggered while you’re off somewhere else peppering the objective with grenades. You can even use Concussion Mine as a regular old grenade by tossing it at a group of enemies and detonating it manually as it gets there. Perhaps most amusingly, you can detonate it under yourself to rocket-jump up to otherwise-inaccessible areas. Just two abilities on one character opens up all those possibilities, and as you might imagine, once you get 12 characters scrapping over objectives, using their abilities to help and hurt one another, further layers of tactical nuance begin to unfurl.  For example: On her own, Pharah can be a major headache by hurling herself high into the air and hovering there while raining rocket-propelled death down on opposing teams from angles that render both cover and positioning moot. But with Mercy the winged medic tending to her, Pharah becomes a whole different kind of problem. Mercy’s Guardian Angel ability allows her to swoop toward any ally in range, even ones up in the sky. Combined with her ability to slow her descent with her wings, she's the only character that can follow Pharah wherever she goes. So you end up with a dynamic duo flying all over the place – the one shoving rockets down people's throats while the other switches between healing her up and buffing her already substantial damage output as needed. The sum of all these minute details is that almost every action, even the ones you repeat again and again, feel just a little bit magical.  Overwatch is rich with synergies like this: Reinhardt and Lucio, Zarya and Reaper, Torbjorn and Symmetra…there's no shortage of opportunities for keen, coordinated play, and when you reach a point where you feel comfortable switching your character on the fly in the middle of a match to capitalize on weak enemy team composition, you feel like a tactical genius. You could spend many hours playing Overwatch before getting to that point by properly wrapping your brain around all the little intricacies it has tucked away behind its approachable veneer, but you certainly don't need to just to have a good time with it. Just trying out different characters, popping off their abilities, and moving through their world feels almost indescribably right, and it's all because of tiny, almost imperceptible details. The lid on Junkrat's grenade launcher flaps and clanks about with his every move, Lucio's movement has just the slightest touch of inertia, so you actually feel like you're skating when you play him. Zenyatta's reload animation might be my favorite; I never got tired of watching him open his arms to materialize a new set of orbs before clasping them together with a satisfying, metallic thud. It's a small thing, sure, but the sum of these minute details is that almost every action, even the ones you repeat again and again, feel just a little bit magical.   Overwatch’s 12 maps are similarly flush with luxuriant details, and they also play a big role in extracting further depth out of the cast’s toolsets. The oppressive first chokepoint on Hanamura begs to have static defenses like Torbjorn’s turret or Symmetra’s sentries built around it, and for attackers with the right mobility skills (see Pharah and Mercy above) the long gap between the left side of the first and second capture point becomes a tantalizing opportunity to flank the defenders before they can reset themselves. Payload-escort maps like Route 66 provide high ground on either side of the attackers route, setting up paranoia-inducing ambush scenarios where Winston’s spherical Shell Barrier becomes invaluable for protection against threats that could be coming from several angles at once. This adds another interesting layer of strategizing and decision making when coming up with team compositions. You aren’t just thinking about how your character will work in the context of your team, but also about what opportunities any given map provides, and how you can exploit them. You’re always in the fight, never wondering where it is or how to get there.  Every map is directly tied to a specific objective type, so their construction is well-tailored to the action at hand. You never get that disjointed feeling of playing capture the flag on a team deathmatch map, like you might in other multiplayer shooters where maps have to accommodate a variety of modes. The upsides are subtle, but significant. Maps are focused without ever feeling constricted; there’s never any question about where you’re headed or how to get there, because every flanking path and side door eventually puts you where you need to be. In this way, Overwatch’s map designs allow you to choose your vector of engagement without risking you getting lost where the action isn’t happening. The result is zero wasted time; you’re always in the fight, never wondering where it is or how to get there.  Tying modes to maps in this one-to-one fashion has a small downside too though: Overwatch doesn’t have a ton of different modes to switch things up like most other games of its kind do. This isn’t Halo where most maps support various team sizes, objectives, and a slew of different modified rules. There’s only one way to play on Volskaya Industries: it will always be attack the first point, then attack the second. This lack of customization allows for finely tuned action, but also cuts into the overall breadth and variety of the experience when compared to other modern multiplayer games. Overwatch takes just about every possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem like people and places rather than puppets and scenery.  But like its characters, Overwatch’s maps are filled with nuances that will take time and repetition to learn, and not just from a mechanical standpoint. Bits of story and world-building can be found throughout the beautifully conceived environments. Movie posters in the spawn room of one map reveal that the mech-piloting pro-gamer D.Va’s real name is Hana Song, and that she had a movie career as well. Another map has a row of arcade machines, and if you happen to be playing as Genji, the cyber-ninja might start reminiscing about how many hours of his “misspent youth” he burned away playing there. Sometimes characters who have a past and don’t like each other find themselves on the same team, and you’ll hear about it. Overwatch takes just about every possible opportunity to make its cast and locales seem like people and places rather than puppets and scenery. In terms of features, Overwatch is just a bit thin, but it meets most of the basic expectations of a multiplayer shooter and in some ways, exceeds them. Its impressive stat-tracking, per-character control mapping, and accessibility options stand out. It also does a great job of identifying and surfacing good play to teammates and opponents through a novel commendation system and a sweet “Play of the Game” highlight reel. Matchmaking is swift and reliable, and the cosmetic unlockables are surprisingly charming and come at a pretty decent pace without paying for extra loot packs. That said, I dug the characters' stock designs so much, I didn't want to stray too far from them anyway.  Overwatch is an incredible achievement in multiplayer shooter design. It bobs and weaves almost perfectly between being the quick-fix adrenaline hit you might want after a long day of work, and the thoughtful, strategic multiplayer experience that becomes the center of evening-long binges with friends. It might not have the most exhaustive list of maps and modes, but it provides nearly endless opportunities for exhilarating, coordinated play, and when you’re the one at the center of it, it feels like nothing else.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	 Both for better and for worse, The Division: Underground would probably be the best way to show a curious, uninitiated player the hazy mix of fun and tedium that typifies Ubisoft’s massive third-person shooter. After all, The Division has always been at its best when the bullets are flying and your team is the only thing standing between you and the swirling chaos of explosions and gunfire, and Underground delivers that in concentrated shots without the long, pointless slogs through empty city streets. In typical Division fashion, though, this expansion still finds a few other ways to waste players’ time, like by saddling them with an ultimately unnecessary grind that threatens to tire them out before they ever get to the good stuff - which incidentally, isn’t all that good anyway. The structure for The Division: Underground is simple and functional once you polish off its one-mission introduction: head to the new social space underneath your base of operations, amorphously named “The Terminal,” and either set up a jaunt into the New York City subway system for yourself, or matchmake to find a squad to roll with. From there, you’re dumped right into a mission that’s cobbled together from randomly chosen rooms, enemies, and objectives. There’s no stumbling about wide-open spaces in search of purpose here; just follow the yellow dot until your motion tracker lights up, and let the good times roll. Combat has always been my favorite thing about The Division, and Underground essentially allows you to mainline it with very little filler or interruption.  The thing is, Underground doesn’t really do much to spice that combat up. You’ll find some neat jamming beacons that prevent ability usage until you destroy them, and an occasional alarm to take out to prevent reinforcements from pouring in, but that’s it as far as new wrinkles go. No new enemy types, no unique objectives to complete, just the same room-clearing you’ve likely already done for hours upon hours. Between fights, new environmental hazards like downed electrical wires or leaky gas mains pop-up for you to contend with, but you’ll have seen them all after a few runs, so they wind up being momentary interruptions rather than interesting challenges to face. Combat remains the clear focus, and Underground’s inability to make it feel new or fresh is its central problem.   It’s far from its only one though.  Like the Dark Zone, Underground has its own ranking progression, so whether your gear score is a paltry 100 or a hefty 250, you have to start in the same place. This creates two issues. One is that as a low level character, I get matched with lots of teammates who are overleveled for the content, which means I might as well sit in the back and sip mojitos, because my overpowered cohorts will likely have ripped through a wave of enemies before I’ve so much as laid eyes on them, essentially trivializing the content for me. The other is that if you happen to be one of those well-geared agents, you’re stuck grinding out missions that offer you little in the ways of challenge or reward until you reach a high enough rank to attempt longer, higher level operations. If matchmaking were based off of gear level, this problem could have been mitigated, but as is, Underground mixes people of low and high gear level, creating a poor experience for both. Underground mixes people of low and high gear level, creating a poor experience for both.  The natural answer, then, would be to play solo if you don’t have a group of like-leveled friends to call on, but Underground falters here too. Even when going it alone, every Underground mission is a strict “no respawn” affair. Worse still, you generally don’t get any loot or Underground XP unless you complete the entire mission, so if you spend 20 minutes carefully making your way through, only to be surprise-killed by one of The Division’s magical monster closets that spawn threats on your flank without warning, your time was for nothing. This is particularly infuriating when you fail due to a bug that prevents any damage from registering against enemies for the remainder of a mission. After losing four solo attempts exactly this way, I just gave up and resigned myself to playing co-op, despite the matchmaking issues. For many hours, I held out hope that once I unlocked the higher difficulty multi-phase missions, things would become more interesting, but that hope proved false in the end. These turned out to be nothing but a series of single-phase missions tacked on to one another, with spongier enemies that churned out higher damage numbers. It’s just a progressively scaling gear check as opposed to more elaborate mission types that might require some planning or strategizing. Focusing on The Division’s strength while trimming the fat sounds like a great idea, but Underground fumbles the idea. This is the same combat you’ve already experienced, just in a dingier, more confined setting, and the lack of gear-appropriate matchmaking means you’re either stuck watching overpowered allies mow down hapless enemies, or you’re stuck doing it until you unlock more challenging content, by which time I was exhausted. The Division: Underground’s thankless grind through countless trivial battles feels empty, and ultimately, pointless.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens-review	 The Force Awakens must be magic. First it reinvigorated Star Wars after a string of duds, and now it’s given the slumping LEGO games the same shot in the arm. LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the most creative, well-paced, and fun LEGO game in years. Developer Traveler's Tales always displays a keen love and affection for its source material, but with this take on the most recent Star Wars movie, it tells an entertaining story that pays wonderful tribute to Episode VII through a slew of smart puzzles and unique characters. Unlike the disjointed storytelling in the disappointing LEGO Marvel’s Avengers, The Force Awakens uses dialogue from the film effectively. The story of Rey, Finn, and company follows the same path as the movie, while also throwing in a bunch of really clever gags and goofs.   Wandering through the ruins of Maz Kanada’s castle, overhearing some weird creatures talk about where they’re going to drink next, and having one of them suggest his old watering hole on Tatooine left a big dumb grin on my face. It even handles heavy events, like that Big Spoilery Thing™ with a solid dose of humor and charm.  I loved scouring each level for all of their secrets. Each level in the eight-hour campaign does a great job of spreading out puzzle solutions between multiple characters and their unique abilities. Unlike LEGO Avengers, where the second player oftentimes found themselves bored, here you’ll need each character’s inherent abilities to make it through a level. Plus, the abilities are generally fun to use -- Rey’s agility creates some great platforming segments, while BB-8’s ability to jack into any electrical outlet allows you to fiddle around and manipulate platforms and other objects in the world. Whether I was playing by myself or alongside a pal, I really enjoyed scouring each level for all of their secrets. That said, certain puzzle mechanics are dull and used a bit too often. For example, playing as Finn and having to line up the head and torsos of a holographic Stormtrooper to enter a First Order door quickly transforms from a light challenge into a chore.   While the destroy, build, and collect mechanics are familiar to anyone who has played a LEGO game, The Force Awakens tosses in some new and unique scenarios that surprised me with how fun they were. Specifically, cover-based shootouts that feel like “My First Gears of War.” These sections were totally unexpected, but really helped deliver some diversity to the familiar gameplay loop. Add in the fact that each character has a special meter that allows you to destroy the battlefield with a cool-looking unique attack, and Force Awakens has the best-feeling action of any LEGO game yet.  Flying levels are fun, frantic, and more entertaining than this year’s Star Fox Zero. Likewise, the flying sections -- both the on-rails and open-air dogfights -- are fun, frantic, and honestly more entertaining than this year’s Star Fox Zero. Whether I was jetting through an asteroid field, gunning down TIE Fighters on my way off of Jakku, or saving the Resistance as Poe on the shores of Takodana, I looked forward to every scene where I got to hop into the cockpit of a ship. I couldn’t help but imagine what Travelers Tales would do with a full-on Rogue Squadron game.   While I love the individual levels, I’m a bit disappointment by the hub worlds. Unlike the awesome, interconnected core of LEGO Harry Potter’s Hogwarts, this series of small hubs here are disjointed and require fairly lengthy load screens to pop between them. It’s not a deal-breaker, but it adds some frustration when you want to check out a bunch of different challenges and worlds. LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens is also filled with cute, smart nods that Star Wars nuts are going to love. Scouring the galaxy for slabs of carbonite that unlock characters from the original trilogy and the prequels is a blast. Likewise, there are rad secret missions that fill in the gaps of certain events left out of the film, with one of the more memorable ones featuring Poe on his rescue mission to snatch Admiral Ackbar. All of this constantly compelled to keep playing on my mission to 100% it. LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens is the most gaming fun I’ve had with either series in years. The story is great, the levels are dense with fun puzzles, and unlocking all of the secrets is a blast. Whether I was going through it solo or playing alongside a buddy, LEGO Star Wars: The Force Awakens proved to be an adaption worthy of its incredible source material.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	 Update: Inside has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  The first 10 minutes of Inside, the long-awaited Limbo follow-up from developer Playdead, swing between being beautiful, haunting, and terrifying. Sometimes it is all three at the exact same time. From there, it adds intrigue, wonder, and shock on top of those and never lets up. For that reason, it’s best if you take my word for it and go in completely blind to discover it for yourself. But if you need to be convinced, keep reading for more on this visually stunning, thought-provoking, and mysterious masterpiece. Even though it is mechanically a 2D puzzle-platformer, Inside is quite simply one of the most beautiful and subtly detailed games I’ve ever played. Every frame appears to have been meticulously crafted and polished several times over, from dust particles hovering in smoky air to raindrops splashing down in a bog to golden sunlight beaming onto your unnamed, red-shirted boy avatar through a window. Everything appears to have had an artist’s full and undivided attention. I often stopped just to admire my surroundings, taking in the subtly detailed animations, moody lighting, boldly contrasting color palette, and even the eerily unsettling sound design. You can hear the boy breathing hard after he’s been running for a while. You can see him stumble after he jumps and sticks a running landing. Gray paints a lot of the scenery, but splashes of color – often red – are used as a bold contrast that draws your eye where the designers want it to go. Camera work is also laudable; the perspective only ever shifts slightly, but from scene to scene you’re always in the optimal viewing position for what’s happening on screen, and there’s always a visual reward anytime the camera moves closer in, pulls further out, or changes angle.  Nothing I can say will prepare you for the vague, wordless events of Playdead’s physics-based puzzle platformer, but without spoiling it, it seems virtually impossible to not be shocked by what transpires. As you break into Inside’s militaristic complex and plumb its strange depths for the roughly three brisk, well-paced hours it takes to complete the campaign, it continually changes in both look and gameplay in unexpected ways. When you end up in a one-man submarine, searching for answers deep inside this base, it is only the beginning of the mystery.  Refreshingly, there are no instructions whatsoever. Inside’s gameplay is similar to Limbo’s simple but atmospheric 2D puzzle-platforming. Deaths are frequent and can seem unavoidable and unfair at first, but they’re actually lessons that teach you both what to do and what not to do. Something has to, because there are (refreshingly) no on-screen or spoken instructions whatsoever. And when you die, the animations of the boy’s demise are so varied and at times over the top as to be entertaining – and sometimes unnerving. Watching him get zapped and dragged off screen by an electronic tentacle or blasted to oblivion adds some levity to balance out the understated maulings and gunshots. Checkpoints, meanwhile, are liberal enough and load times are brief enough that death never feels like a penalty.  Like in Limbo, your only buttons are jump (A) and interact (X) (or up and Right Ctrl by default on PC, with the arrow keys handling movement), with subtle cues of hue or light directing your attention to where it needs to go. The puzzles themselves are a bit easier than those in Limbo – I never got hung up for more than a few minutes before having one of those gratifying puzzle-solving epiphanies. Some involve moving select objects, like boxes. Others see you activating odd air-propelled cubes that soar into the air and hover for a moment before returning to the ground and resetting. And there are several more that would be spoilery to discuss, but they add up to a good variety. Occasionally those are blended, necessitating experimentation with physics in order to get the angles just right. The complex itself is sometimes your opponent, be it great heights, unexplained concussion blasts, or deep water you’ll have to dive deep into without drowning.  Encounters are so expertly choreographed such that you always escape them by the skin of your teeth. Later challenges involve getting past organic foes, be it dogs or...more exotic life forms. These encounters are so expertly choreographed such that you always escape them by the skin of your teeth when you succeed (and when you don’t, you’re treated to a gruesome display of the boy being mauled, or worse). In fact, they were still white-knuckle moments on my second playthrough – even when I knew what was coming. The point is, no matter the puzzle, it’s almost always intuitive while not necessarily being obvious, and the handful of mechanics are mixed and matched enough that Inside never wears out its welcome or succumbs to repetition. It wisely ends before it runs out of ideas to sustain that feeling.  And Inside’s puzzles, both biological and environmental, serve as the vehicle that drives its storytelling. No explanation is ever given for why the boy is alone in the woods at night, nor why he sneaks into the mysterious facility, or what he hopes to achieve there – much less who is trying to stop him. Things happen in this game that are practically indescribable. It’s almost dreamlike in that it can start in a logical, grounded place and somehow end up somewhere far more fantastical. Playing it a second time, even though I knew all of the puzzle solutions, gave me a chance to consider the early parts of the story and how they connect to the end of it more carefully. I am still thinking about Inside – what it means and what it says about humanity – and I am enjoying the debate with myself and my co-workers. I urge you to play it, both because it is a masterpiece of 2D platformer design, but also because it would be a crime to have what happens here ruined for you before you do. I can practically guarantee you that you will not expect where Inside goes. Inside very clearly builds upon what made Limbo great, and in fact builds something greater. Its unimaginable twist may leave you dumbfounded, confused, and quite possibly speechless, but it will fuel heated discussion with your friends about its meaning, its message, and its intentions. It’s a short ride, but one I felt compelled to take again – including a search for its mysterious hidden orb collectibles. Play it soon before anyone spoils a single big moment for you.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/17/trials-of-the-blood-dragon-review	 Sorry to burst your bubble, but the Trials games are not good motorcycle simulations. They're actually a great physics-management series. They have always been at their best when they've caused me to think on the fly (literally) about how to properly land a motorcycle that's just launched off a ramp hundreds of feet into the sky. To that extent, Trials of the Blood Dragon represents some of the franchise's best moments with some truly insane stunts with ridiculous jumps, speedy movement, and the awesome addition of a grappling hook. Then it makes you get off your bike and shoot things in dull interludes, and it ends so quickly it can't quite make a great impression. Spinning off from the story-free Trials series by injecting the same neon '80s nostalgia we saw in the over-the-top Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon is mostly a good move. While previous Trials have a sort of BBC-inspired dry comedy to them, Trials of the Blood Dragon is pure camp, straight out of Miami Connection or The Running Man. In fact, Trials of the Blood Dragon is actually broken up into a batch of mini-campaigns that lampoon '80s and '90s landmark works like Raiders of the Lost Ark, Starship Troopers, and Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers.  Most of those homages work pretty well, and the animated cutscenes between each stage are well done, but what brings some of these old-school throwbacks down is the voice acting. Granted, much of the source material Trials of the Blood Dragon references is based on bad acting, but there’s an art to capturing the brain-dead enthusiasm of those sources. Here, there's so little life in the main characters that pipe up during levels (including some unneeded stereotype chatter during the Vietnam stages) that I completely tuned them out and tried to concentrate more on the top-notch techno soundtrack.  I had a blast riding through Indiana Jones-style ruins and garish Japanese skyscrapers. Trials of the Blood Dragon's best moments are exactly where I expected them: on the seat of a bike as I zoomed down hills, through loops, and caught mad air while trying to keep upright and at a high speed to earn the best grades with fast and crash-free runs (though I wish there were bonus points awarded for landing risky flips). With such great source material to reference, I had a blast riding through Indiana Jones-style ruins and garish Japanese skyscrapers. Adding a grappling hook to certain stages intensified the action adding a new layer to pondering the speed and momentum of the bikes. Where do I attach the cable? When do I let go? If anything, I wish the grappling hook was used earlier and far more often than it is, especially when a later stage briefly includes a puzzle that keeps you swinging from a single hook for an extended period to avoid sawblades. I similarly enjoyed brief sections where you had to take into account alternate physics when dragging a nuclear bomb behind the bike, handling a minecart or tank, and flying through space via a jetpack.  When Trials of the Blood Dragon took that physics management away from me, my interest dropped like a lead balloon on Mars. While they look great, a ride down the side of a skyscraper and a drug trip in Miami frustrated me by changing the physics and throwing the track together at the last second, respectively.  Platforming and shooting is rarely challenging or rewarding. Those were mere drops in the rage bucket compared to the many shooting segments scattered throughout Trials of the Blood Dragon. The platforming and shooting is rarely challenging or rewarding (save for a section where you have to escape literal Hell and outrun lava), and it really sucks to have a great run on the bike negated by a bad floaty jump or stray bullet from an enemy. It gets even worse when stealth comes into the equation and you have to hide behind barriers and wait to avoid slow searchlights. There are also sections where you use the gun while on a bike, which I enjoyed when needed to shoot targets that moved ramps into place but got annoyed at when enemies were scattered on the track and caused deaths for reasons beyond bad landings. Even though I was able to complete Trials of the Blood Dragon's campaign in under four hours, I would have prefered an even shorter run that was purely vehicular. Yes, Trials of the Blood Dragon is exceptionally short, especially in comparison to previous Trials games. The 27 levels each run three to eight minutes long, and there's no level editor to increase the track count. Still, the gorgeous stage design and soundtrack will probably pull me back into some of the non-shooting levels I've conquered to race my previous scores and leaderboard friends. There's also the metagame of the “Ominous Locked Safe” that can only be unlocked with keys found by following cryptic clues. I've yet to make progress in that area, but I'm happy that Redlynx's proclivity for overarching puzzles extends to this Trials, too. Here's hoping this one will actually conclude in our lifetime. Much like you'd see in a seedy 1980s movie, Trials of the Blood Dragon is like a pretty good first hit of a drug. The buzz is short and mostly enjoyable, but it's so different that you might get hooked on the series. It's got a great gateway due to the story's ties to Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon, the flashy neon art, the constant pop-culture references, and fantastic techno score. Just realize that the shooting is bad and that you may come down from this high way earlier than you'd expect. But if this is your first Trial, know that there's lots more to consume.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	 I consider myself one of the original Mirror’s Edge’s biggest fans. The 2008 first-person parkour platformer struck me as bold as it was beautiful, and it remains a game I revisit every year or so. In fact, I was so excited for its revival I actually cheered when Mirror’s Edge Catalyst was confirmed by EA. It’s one of the biggest letdowns of my gaming life, then, that playing through this half-prequel, half-reboot was an exercise in enthusiasm-draining disappointment. Catalyst is hardly a bad game, thanks to the strength of its movement systems, but everything else about it is so uninspiring that I get sad when I recall my initial reaction to its announcement. Running is supposed to release endorphins that make people happy, but Faith Connors and her friends don’t seem to take any joy in being off-the-grid mailmen in the city of Glass’ Big Brother-ruled future. Literally everyone in Mirror’s Edge Catalyst is sullen at best or angry at worst, and without a shred of humor or levity it becomes a huge downer. Fun fact: you won’t see a single smile in this entire eight to 10-hour story campaign (more if you fill it out with sidequests) until Faith finally cracks a grin in the post-credits scene. Character development is nonexistent, and worse, everyone – including Faith herself – is completely unlikable.  The main story arc is both thin and predictable, and Faith’s own flashback-fueled backstory is lifted almost directly out of the Bruce Wayne playbook. You may not have liked the animated, eSurance-looking cutscenes that told the story of the original Mirror’s Edge, but the first game’s simpler plot did a lot more with a lot less than Catalyst does with its convoluted, pointless mess. Given that this is a prequel, it’s not surprising (or a spoiler) when Catalyst more or less comes right out and says, “Welp, you’d expect things to have changed after all this, but nope, everything’s the same” at the end of the campaign, but it is disappointing. It only reinforced the apathy I felt toward the characters the entire time.   So let’s ignore the story and focus on what made Mirror’s Edge unique and exciting in the first place. Locomotion in Catalyst still feels as fresh and empowering as it did in 2008, with our viewpoint firmly fixed inside Faith’s noggin for every jump, slide, wallrun, and skill roll (save for the occasional finishing move that pulls the camera out to third-person). That perspective makes the simple act of running a thrill, just like in the original. The crunch of gravel or the squeak of a glass floor under Faith’s feet, the heavy breaths she draws as she runs faster and longer – it’s practically exhilarating to string moves together successfully as you move from one area of Glass to another across its rooftops. The grappling hook you’ll pick up partway through the campaign helps sell the idea that Faith can traverse a city like you can tie your shoes. Perhaps no other game utilizes the LB/L1 button more than Catalyst – it’s your jump button that leads into momentum jumps, mid-air attacks, and ziplines – but it feels perfectly natural as you run and jump around Glass.  Speed and momentum are encouraged by the game design, in that Faith has both a health meter and a “shield” of sorts that’s fueled by her continuous movement. This makes it difficult for weapon-wielding enemies to hit her, and when you can dash around an area keeping your shield up, you can scan your environment relative to each bad guy’s location and plot each one’s own unique, aggressive takedown: a chest-kick from above, a wallrun-fueled kick to the side of the head, etc. Slow down or stop, however, and you’ll be more vulnerable to the attacks – both melee and ranged – of K-Sec guards. Catalyst, like its predecessor, subtly but effectively guides you in the direction of your objective by turning a nearby interactable object red, indicating that you should jump, slide, mantle, or climb it in order to progress. Contrasted against the city’s appealing use of primary colors – a welcome reprieve from the grays and browns that drape many modern first-person games – it’s a laudable substitute for the usual giant “GO HERE” arrow that points to the next goal.  Unlike the original Mirror’s Edge, Catalyst’s version of the gleaming white city of Glass is an open world, and it offers a couple of advantages. First, it lets you challenge yourself to put together epic-length, perfect runs that span the entire city. In fact, a built-in tool lets you easily create your own time trials (a fan-favorite feature from the original that’s put to better use in this freeform city), which will automatically show up as optional events in your friends’ games. And while some sidequest events are fetch quests good for little more than building up your XP so you can unlock more traversal moves, combat abilities, or Faith’s take-it-or-leave-it gear (such as the Disrupt attack from her grappling hook that stuns enemies with an EMP-type blast), other missions like the Billboard Hacks and Secret Messenger Bag retrievals become enjoyably challenging little parkour puzzles unto themselves. And when you inevitably miss a precise jump, checkpoints are mercifully liberal and reload times are fairly speedy, making your parkour failure easier to digest and reckless experimentation more fun.   Combat has also been revamped since the first Mirror’s Edge, and the new system is hit and miss. Unlike the original, Faith never even gets the option to wield a gun in Catalyst, which focuses the fights on fast and furious beatings (though sadly, that means you can no longer earn an Achievement for finishing the campaign without picking up a firearm). I welcome this, as guns never fit her character anyway and, and use of them subjected you to the original game’s most difficult-to-use controls; stripping them out makes everything flow better. So does Catalyst’s new HUD indicator, which lets you not only know if bad guys are around, but also which general direction your enemies are in, removing the clunky and confusing guesswork that marked the fights in Faith’s first outing.  Punches and kicks can be varied by mixing in directions, allowing you to throw a Holly Holm-on-Ronda-Rousey kick to the side of a helmeted foe’s skull. Landing one of those makes me feel powerful as his protective facemask shatters and he stumbles into one of his buddies, injuring the bad-guy bystander as well. The same feeling of strength comes from attacking an enemy with a parkour move, i.e. wallrunning and then punching a K-Sec guard in the face or speeding down a zipline, letting go, and planting both feet straight into a target’s chest. Combat becomes a bit awkward when you’re not running, however (a condition that is sometimes forced by the story missions). When that happens it’s too easy to cheese enemies when standing toe to toe by alternating directional kicks, particularly when you’re near a rooftop edge or railing, as stumbling guards will practically throw themselves over the edge like they’re extras in a Rambo parody.    Mirror’s Edge’s move to an open world also comes at a cost, however. Catalyst prioritizes a high framerate, but as a result, texture quality suffers, particularly on the console versions. It gives Catalyst a bland look rather than the boldness brought by the primary colors of the original, which are still on display here but are literally muddled. Even then, it’s far from a steady 60 frames a second on consoles, with frequent noticeable dips. Playing on PC with your input method of choice is highly recommended. Gameplay-wise, Glass is full of an endless pile of sidequests that mean you’ll always have something to do, but most simply involve running from Point A to Point B. Even the joy of Mirror’s Edge’s parkour movement can’t endure this kind of shameless repetition for long, especially in a city as bland and devoid of unique and interesting landmarks and hazards as this one. Without the setpiece-focused design of the original, Catalyst feels barren of memorable spots like the first game’s crane or construction yard.  Beyond those, we’re expected to track down the inevitable truckload of collectibles stashed around the city, but that concept is a complete mismatch for a game built on constant movement and momentum. Most of these items are hidden in such a way that you’re forced to stop in your tracks, defying the central design principle Catalyst is built upon. Looking for them is the worst way to spend time in this game. The staples of Mirror’s Edge remain refreshing and unique in the first-person genre in 2016, but Catalyst’s attempts to keep up with the open-world Joneses don’t always jive with its design strengths of movement and momentum. On top of that, muddy-looking console versions and a lame story filled with unlikable characters doom Mirror’s Edge’s return to fall short. I was so happy this game was being made, but in the end I’m just as disappointed in how it turned out.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/dead-island-definitive-collection-review	" When IGN first reviewed Dead Island back in 2011 we gave it a score of 8.0, for ""great."" We had this to say about it: ""Dead Island probably won't win any game of the year awards. It's got visual bugs, the controls take a bit to feel normal, and the presentation in general isn't up to snuff. But the game gets a lot right. There is a huge world to explore, thousands of zombies to kill, and tons of side quests to take. Here on the other side of a 25-hour playthrough – where I skipped a lot of side quests after Act 1 – I'm anxious to get back into Dead Island, and despite the game's flaws, that's not something I say often.""  Two years later, we were less kind to the quasi-sequel Dead Island: Riptide in our review. ""It’s a fun time, but there are no surprises or killer new features to make it an impressive package."" It scored a 7.2, for ""good.""  The sunshine ray effect alone sometimes caused me to pause in wonder. And now we have the remastered Dead Island Definitive Collection, and the tale's much the same. The big difference is that it (generally) looks a lot better, thanks to the help of the Chrome Engine 6 that developer Techland used for its spiritual successor, Dying Light, last year. This is more than a simple touch-up – comparing the old and new versions side by side, I was sometimes stunned to realize how many new environmental objects and new textures were stuffed into almost every square yard of this re-release. The sunshine ray effect alone sometimes caused me to pause in wonder at how well it captured the humid midday haze, or the brief shock of blindness as one leaves the sunny outdoors and enters a darkened room. The character models and associated facial animations didn't receive quite the same attention and still look like 2011 holdovers, but play of the light on their faces sometimes grants them a vitality they didn't have before.   I'm not one to obsess over framerates, but it’s not up to par. Such loving work comes with some heavy costs that sometimes manifest in unexpected ways. The biggest one is that neither Dead Island nor Riptide can exceed their 30-frames-per-second cap, which is extremely disappointing for an updated version of a last-generation game. I'm not one to obsess over framerates, but when the PS4 and Xbox One struggle to even maintain that rate in Riptide, it’s not up to par. And these problems crop up even with some concessions: no longer, for instance, can I idly kick about the beach balls on the tragedy-stricken beaches. And while I'm sure on some technical level the water effects have improved, but they look less impressive than the original.  These concerns rarely dampened the fun I had with both games. The bugs, too, while not totally extinct, usually only bothered me when some zombie got stuck on a beach chair or something. This is certainly the best version of Dead Island for newcomers to jump into, and it certainly doesn't hurt that the base game enjoys many of the interface improvements that came with Riptide. When I did start to get bored, it was more from the unchanging design of it all. The stories and acting in Dead Island and its quasi-sequel Riptide have ever been the stuff of 1:00 AM B-movies, and the quests never really amount to much more than kill this, fetch that.  Few first-person games have had such satisfying melee combat. But there’s always fun, too, whether it’s in the brutal thwacks of the rapper Sam B as he smashes the skull of another bikini-clad zombie with a oar, or in the way Xian Mei slices and dices the competition. Few first-person games have had such satisfying melee combat. (The Definitive Collection even comes with the popular and cathartic PC mod that destroys enemies in one or two hits. Caveats: it's only available in single-player, and the appeal of being overpowered doesn't last long.) Like nearly all co-op games, Dead Island is always best playing with other people, and in the goofiness going on in voice chat it was possible to overlook the deficiencies of characterization and storytelling.  As a returning player looking for new content, I had the most fun with the 16-bit sidescrolling beat 'em up that comes with the collection. It's called Dead Island Retro Revenge, and it features a Jack Black-soundalike trying to save his cat by rushing down what looks like Venice Beach with zombies. (It sounds a hell of a lot like the setting for the AWOL Dead Island 2, at least judging from its trailer from E3 2014.) Retro Revenge itself is fun enough, although its combat and settings are highly repetitive. (In other words, it's a lot like Dead Island.) It's a lane-brawler that automatically shuttles faux-Jack along as he taps out the proper kicks and punches for this or that type of zombie, all while hitting them at the right time for multipliers. In practice, it feels a little more like playing Guitar Hero than Double Dragon. It's simple stuff, but it was the best time I had with the whole package. With the Dead Island Definitive Edition, Dead Island and Dead Island Riptide have never looked so good. The use of Dying Light's graphics engine means almost every setting looks better and more realistic than it did at the start of the decade, but it unfortunately doesn’t run any better now than it did then. With around 35 hours of gameplay packed in and a fun little retro beat 'em up to complement it all, though, it's the best way to play if you missed these zombie-smashers."
Henry Gilbert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	 When it comes to current games based on One Piece, there isn't much room on the Thousand Sunny pirate ship for neophytes. One Piece: Burning Blood reshapes one of the series' most important arcs into a 3D fighting game that'll confuse anyone outside of its fanbase. But as someone heavily invested in the pirate lifestyle of the long-running manga and anime series, I’m impressed with how just dense the crew is on this voyage, even as I wished for better combat and a broader story in Luffy's newest brawler. Burning Blood's combat will be immediately familiar to anyone who played the underwhelming crossover J-Stars Victory Vs.+. Burning Blood is all about colorful, noisy, one-on-one 3D battles where you swap between fighters in teams of up to three different characters, and the combat is full of flashy action ripped straight from the source. That style makes the early rounds of battle a visual treat, particularly when Haki users enter the fray to pull off some badass dodges and combos. Unfortunately, Burning Blood needs that flash to compel you to learn its somewhat wonky and chaotic approach to combat.  Even though the roster is an admirable 44 characters deep, their actual variety is so limited that battles feel overly simple. I took out most early AI-controlled fighters by button-mashing my way through Burning Blood's nine large, sparsely decorated arenas. Later challenges up the difficulty some and there's certainly technique to dodging massive attacks from heavies like Hawk Eyes and Sengoku, but overwhelming an opponent with a flood of richly detailed attacks is still a winning strategy. As disappointing as it was to find that ceiling to Burning Blood's gameplay, I still had fun with those adjusted expectations.   The stages are a bit too big for this kind of action, too – you spend nearly as much time chasing your opponent as you do firing off attacks. Space is needed for some of the bigger moves to work, but the available distance can briefly get confusing when an enemy runs too far away. Plus, the slightly off-center camera takes some getting used to, and even once I adjusted to it, the over-the-shoulder camera placement never felt preferable to more traditional camera views from classics like Tekken or Virtua Fighter. Attacks get wackier and wackier the deeper you go into the roster.  Attacks get wackier and wackier the deeper you go into the roster, like Emporio Ivankov's wonderfully ridiculous Face Spectrum that fills up the screen with his Rocky Horror Picture Show-like features. And these vibrant displays still look good even after seeing them dozens of times. Burning Blood prioritizes style over substance -- arguably the correct choice when making such a fan service-focused game, but it comes at the cost of mechanical depth. I was much more interested in seeing Luffy's many Gum-Gum attacks being done correctly than if a screen-filling attack really hit me.  Burning Blood may lack carefully measured hitboxes, but that chaos is the draw of One Piece. None of the hits I took felt unfair to the point of frustration, even if with unbalanced gameplay. One Piece is at its most enjoyable when folks (whether online or in person) toss away any tactical restraint and treat fights like a reckless party game they are.   When it comes to the solo campaign, Burning Blood somehow finds a way to simultaneously over- and underdeliver. The single-player adventure is ripped straight from one of One Piece's most epic adventures: The Paramount War, aka the Marineford Arc. The fully Japanese-voiced cutscenes gorgeously recreate moments from the series, with a source-material-accurate spin on traditional cel-shading that captures the heavily inked style of the manga. In the concise four-hour-long campaign, you experience multiple viewpoints of the triumph and tragedy of Luffy's attempt to save his brother Ace, all while a war between pirates and marines happens all around you. Burning Blood expects high familiarity with One Piece from anyone who picks up the controller.  But that also means the somewhat short campaign will make zero sense to non-fans, explaining virtually nothing from the previous 500-plus episodes of the anime that lead up to this story. Burning Blood expects high familiarity with One Piece from anyone who picks up the controller. Conversely, while One Piece fans will enjoy playing through such an important chapter in Luffy's life, the limited scope mostly ignores the more than five years of plot that have taken place since, simply stopping when the Paramount War concludes. This approach to the campaign ends up being a lose-lose situation: too dense for the uninitiated, and too limited for diehards. Good thing the limited scope of the campaign doesn't extend to Burning Blood's fighters. The massive roster and even bigger collection of support characters offers a taste of the later years of One Piece, particularly with post-timeskip Luffy and his relatively new Fourth Gear form. That transformation changes up his combat considerably. Another great moment of mythology influencing gameplay is seeing all the creative ways Sanji avoids fighting the women on the roster.  You'll get little bits of the characters' background here and there as the fights go on, sometimes with a quick quip before a fight with folks like Nami and Zoro referring to some past history. You'll even get surprising trivia thrown in to spice up an assist from the likes of Ivankov stopping an attack from Sakazuki. Moments big and small like those are when Burning Blood is at its best - using One Piece mythology to justify a cool addition to the gameplay even if there isn't space for them in the brief campaign. Still, I wish the developers had a more expansive view of the series rather than briefly touching on some of the more interesting, recent mythology. One Piece: Burning Blood understands what makes the pirate life so compelling in the source material, and is fairly successful in channelling that roguish spirit into its chaotic fights. That flashy, firm commitment to action will feel welcoming to One Piece's biggest fans, but confusing to everyone else. It’s great to have something made just for fans, though even Luffy's biggest supporters will be let down by the brief, limited campaign. At its best, this wild and crazy fighter makes for a fun distraction for folks who've been dying for more One Piece games to get localized.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review	" We're told that The Blood and Wine expansion for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt marks the last great ride of Geralt of Rivia, so far as developer CD Projekt Red is concerned. I like to think there are signs that this isn't the case, as much of its storyline revolves around the return of a friend long thought permanently lost. But even if it is, it's about as good as a sendoff as we could ask for. The sun may shine brighter here than it ever has for the Butcher of Blaviken, and there's a undercurrent of hope that's been lost in the flood of despair in previous entries, but fittingly enough, above all this is a tale of the pain of letting go. Most of the expansion's strength comes from the way it makes a clean break with the rest of The Witcher 3, shuttling us far from the corpse piles of Velen and the gray gloom of Skellige mere moments after accepting the relevant quest from a message board. The destination is Toussaint, a lovely place of rolling hills carpeted with vineyards and bathed in a warm light that seems to chase away the blues. It's a smart shift, as it avoids any guilt that Geralt should be busying himself with the bigger issues of the region (as was sometimes the case in Hearts of Stone). In sunny Toussaint, Geralt is just a famous witcher with no urgent need to save the world hanging over his head, and in the context of an expansion the tale is all the better for it.  I admit I initially harbored some worries that it dabbled too much in buffoonery. Toussaint is modeled on the south of France, and barely an hour goes by before one of its brightly colored knights is yelling to a giant about how he'll chop him ""into a pâté."" The story brims with gags at the expense of wine connoisseurship, right down to a sommelier who can sniff out the precise vintage of a specific wine based on a stain in seconds. The French chivalric tradition gets the skewer, too, and I rolled my eyes upon learning about a big to-do over a monogrammed handkerchief with the initials D.L.C. For a brief while I felt like telling you all not go to Toussaint – it is too silly a place for this grim and serious character to thrive.  Duchess Anna Henrietta embodies the complexities of Toussaint itself. But I was love with the place within the first two hours of this roughly 20 to 25-hour adventure. It gives us another side of Geralt's world, and it shows that CD Projekt Red can still spin a good tale without leaning too heavily on doom and gloom. Even though Toussaint is only about the size of Velen's No Man's Land, going back to Novigrad and Skellige now feels like exile. It's not just the sight of its picturesque castle surrounded by snowcapped mountains that won me over, it's also the strong cast of characters. There's a quick-tempered shoe-shine boy who never fails to try to make a profit out of any conversation; there's Geralt's captivating, newly returned friend, whom I shall refrain from revealing; and there's a roguish young woman whose spite threatens to end the comparative happiness of Toussaint for good. But most of all I'm taken with the Duchess Anna Henrietta of Toussaint. She embodies the complexities of Toussaint itself, adorning herself in finery when at peace but fighting valiantly and confidently when the need arises. A little unexpectedly for this tale of sun and wine-swigging fun, this is chiefly a tale about vampires. It's generally handled well, even if the main antagonist is never so strongly depicted as the large cast of characters who surround him. He comes off as a petulant though powerful idiot, and his one true moment of complexity vanishes as swiftly as he does when shifting out of corporeal form. He mainly serves to give Geralt's returned friend more complexity. In fact, the vampire framework mainly serves as a backdrop for two good people struggling to justify their affection for their intractable friends and family and the consequences those relationships have for everyone else.  Yet the lore is fascinating stuff. The tale takes us deep into Witcher creator Andrzej Sapkowski's strange and fascinating take on vampires, and it maintains momentum by introducing new twists whenever the story seems near a close. It's a brilliant celebration of the varied Witcher experience we've known until now, whether it's through the expected battles, the chumming about at masquerade balls, or Good Guy Geralt lifting age-old curses or even having a showdown with the Big Bad Wolf.  Boss battles generally emphasize swiftness and careful strategic thought. As in Hearts of Stone, boss battles here generally emphasize swiftness and careful strategic thought, which again marks a welcome shift from the predictable brawls of the core game. (Eredin, I'm looking at you.) Among my favorite was a tournament battle with a huge rolling-rock creature that attempted to smash me in a small arena without any shelter, thus demanding several carefully timed dodges. The color that Blood and Wine brings to The Witcher 3 isn't just limited to landscape. Sometimes it's literal, as in the case of the cosmetic dyes Geralt can use on his Witcher sets (but, unfortunately, not on anything else). A small thing? Perhaps. But it means a lot to people like me who won't even wear an otherwise-good suit of armor if it looks like mismatched garbage. Dyes, too, allowed me to appreciate pieces I already loved in new ways. Take the Ursine armor; with a rich red dye splashed on it, I felt like I was some kind of inquisitor for Game of Thrones' R'hllor.  Blood and Wine also introduces us to Geralt of Rivia, landed vintner, after he receives a dilapidated vineyard estate early on (and populated by peasants who seem completely unaware he's the boss). It's the kind of place I personally wouldn't mind retiring on, but it admittedly seems little out of character for Geralt of Rivia, monster slayer extraordinaire and rider of Roaches. I reconcile it by remembering that this expansion represents a retirement of sorts for Geralt. In practice, renovating it grants a great place to show off Geralt's armor and weapons rather than stashing them in a trunk, and a way of gaining some extra bonuses in exchange for gold. A bed, for instance grants Geralt vitality; a renovated stable gives Roach some more stamina. There's even a garden for growing herbs and an alchemy lab that can break down mutagens. That all makes for great reasons to come back and visit every once in awhile, but I do regret that there's virtually no choice involved aside from the decision to fork over some cash to have this or that building repaired. This is to say nothing of all the new weapons, armors, and goodies like a new Skellige gwent deck that round off the expansion, complete with grandmaster-crafted sets with set bonuses. Often these set bonuses even appear on the non-Witcher-specific sets you'll find, such as my personal favorite suit of vampiric heavy armor, which grants massive melee resistances and restores vitality for each enemy killed as long as I'm wearing at least three of its six pieces.  The expansion also brings mutations which (finally) unlock new skill slots and grant side effect. The expansion also brings mutations which (finally) unlock new skill slots and grant side effects, such as one that boosts attack power and sign intensity in the first few seconds of a battle. These 12 mutations can greatly change the flavor of The Witcher 3's combat, whether it's by causing enemies to explode as you kill them with critical hits or granting a chance for a killing blow to cause Geralt to heal back to full health. All of this stuff might have trivialized the early story and battles, and thus mutations in particular are smartly aimed at giving New Game Plus players an edge as they venture into harder difficulties. As such, you can't even hold your own in the Blood and Wine content until around level 33, so the early game remains challenging. (If you want to skip all that and jump in with a fresh level-35 character, you can.) Still, a patch released alongside the expansion will bring improvements to the user interface for everyone, including a long-overdue option to read new books and letters the second you pick them up. I do wish we could have at least one more expansion, but Blood and Wine's additions help shore up some of the The Witcher 3's few weak points. It's a good way to leave Geralt. But that doesn't mean I won't miss him. Blood and Wine ends the saga of Geralt of Rivia in style, bringing with it a tale of charming vampires and troublesome friendship set in a stunning new landscape that departs from the bleakness we've known until now. The expansion also brings some welcome gameplay enhancements, including mutations, the ability to dye armor, and a vineyard for growing herbs. Most of all, it leaves Geralt in a good place."
Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	" For all of its problems, 2011’s Homefront introduced an interesting Red Dawn-like concept, and revisiting post-invasion America in an open-world first-person shooter format sounded promising; but this fledgling FPS franchise has let me down again. There are some genuinely good ideas in Homefront: The Revolution, but nearly every one of them comes with a big fat “but.” While initially engaging, the stealth and shooter gameplay quickly becomes tedious, the story is terrible, and a general lack of polish means Homefront: The Revolution fails to make finishing its 20-hour campaign feel worthwhile. Where The Revolution does succeed is in the atmospheric design of its world. The backstory of a North Korea-occupied United States is present in every part of developer Dambuster's version of Philadelphia. From bombed-out homes to historic landmarks converted into propaganda-covered re-education centers, the authoritarian atmosphere is ever-present.   While it’s described as an open world, The Revolution’s map is made up of eight separate districts that the main quest drives you through in a decidedly linear order, with few reasons to return to an old one when you’re through. The Red Zones, where the fighting was heaviest during the initial invasion, are mostly defined by ruined buildings and piles of rubble. Aside from the occasional switch in color pallets and a few landmarks in the downtown area, these desolate no-man’s-land areas feel almost indistinguishable from one another.  Earlston is dirty, the people seem miserable, and it must smell awful. The populated Yellow Zones, however, are much more diverse and each tells its own story. Earlston, which you visit early on, feels like little more than a glorified refugee camp. It’s dirty, the people seem miserable, and it must smell awful. Ashcroft, on the other hand, is where the American KPA collaborators reside, and the alleyways between brownstones are always alive with resentful chatter from the rest of the downtrodden population. While on a technical level the graphics may be underwhelming, the streets of Philadelphia feel world-weary and lived-in. It’s a shame that such a well-crafted world is squandered on such a ponderous and uninspired plot. The story of Homefront: The Revolution is nothing more than a string of forgettable mission objectives sewn together with cliches pulled from the Big Book of Military Shooter Tropes. There were several times that I hoped I might be surprised by an interesting reveal, but alas I was merely treated to yet another facepalm-inducing ""twist"". Classic eye-rolling moments like “Tertiary Character Gets Bonus Emotional Investment Upon Death” or “Curse Your Sudden-But-Inevitable Betrayal!” are presented by a cast of characters who spend all their time yelling over one another with groan-worthy one-liners. While there are plenty of discussions meant to make us ponder the fine line between freedom fighter and terrorist, any weight these moments might have had is lost when our boring, mute protagonist silently nods and blindly agrees to blow up the next power station, drone factory or whatever else the Resistance points you at. There are no meaningful decisions to make, which makes me wonder why they didn’t give the main character his own voice if his path is set in stone.  The good news is that blowing up military police stations isn’t inherently awful; it's just extremely repetitive. You arrive in a district and complete enough “Liberation Activities” to inspire the population to rise up and take back their neighborhood. These can range from blowing up trucks and fuel tanks with bombs strapped to RC cars to hacking security terminals with the same idiot-proof minigame every time. There were also unexpected bits of platforming that would unlock a new outpost for the resistance, which were a welcome breather from the routine. The Revolution could’ve used a lot more diversions like these to keep monotony from setting in. Once the district has revolted, there’s some rioting and a lengthy (but forgettable) story mission or two, then it’s off to the next district to do it all over again. And again, and again, until The Revolution just sort of… ends, in an underwhelming finale. Bizarrely, you can’t go back to finish anything you may have missed, even if you wanted to. Yes, I was provided with a “point of no return” warning, but I haven’t been locked out of revisiting an open world after the credits since Fallout 3 - it was especially odd considering that there are no custom save slots.  Neither stealth nor shooting is worth writing home about. The repetitive sabotage missions are a familiar combination of first-person stealth and shooting. Neither style of play is worth writing home about. Sneaking through alleys and checkpoints is fun for a bit – the first few times I narrowly avoided detection were legitimately exciting – but doesn’t hold up for long thanks to a lack of any unique stealth mechanics. Beyond the ability to hide in dumpsters and create distractions with various crafted bombs, incendiary devices or hacking tools, it’s very basic stealth – you can’t even stash a body. Getting caught and forced into a firefight never feels particularly dangerous, either, especially once you realize you can just round a corner and wait for enemies to come at you one at a time until you’re waist-high in corpses. As with the stealth sections, it's fun at first - but this is largely due to your limited starting arsenal. Once you obtain better gear, the slow-witted AI combined with the lethargic way both enemies and I moved around the battlefield makes gunplay feel sluggish, especially when compared to Homefront’s finger-twitching contemporaries.   The Revolution does distinguish itself from other “realistic” near-future military shooters with an interesting on-the-fly crafting and weapon conversion system. Bearing more than a passing resemblance to Crysis’ weapon modification system, this in-game menu allows you to quickly install attachments to a weapon at a moment’s notice. Being able to hot-swap the scope on a bolt-action rifle, for example, means you’ve got a much more versatile weapon: I could deal with shotgun-wielding shock troops up close, then switch to the long-distance scope to pick off a pesky sniper.  You get to watch your character strip apart an assault rifle and attach new parts to its frame. It goes further than that, becoming in effect a lore-friendly solution to a common inventory problem, in that you’re effectively able to carry more than the standard two (or three) guns. With some very cool animations, you get to watch your character strip apart an assault rifle and attach new parts to its frame until it transforms into a mine launcher, or convert a pistol into an SMG. Mechanically speaking there’s no real difference between toggling between modes and just holstering one weapon and drawing another, but Homefront does it with some flair and is more believable than the bottomless-pockets inventory we see in games like GTA 5. While the weapons work reasonably well, what makes combat extra frustrating is the surprising number of bugs that constantly reminded me of The Revolution’s lack of polish. In addition to constant framerate drops and slowdowns, enemies will frequently spawn on top of you as you’re walking around, or may disappear entirely as you move around them. One of my personal favorites is the checkpoint save system which, on multiple occasions respawned me - weapon holstered - in the center of a large group of enemies. That one was extra fun because, with no option to restart the mission or generate a custom save, my only options were to repeatedly try to fight my way through or start the whole game over again.   There’s also the co-op Resistance mode, where squads of up to four players can tackle missions set in the various districts around Philadelphia. However, with only six missions available to play, I was confused as to why Resistance mode includes such a huge number of unlockable items and skills. While exploring the world is a bit more fun with other people, I can’t imagine wanting to play these missions enough times to unlock more than a few new abilities. Though its world has some great aesthetic devices and a cool concept, ultimately all of Homefront: The Revolution’s elements feel repetitive, unpolished, or downright unnecessary. Over the length of its campaign it fails to deliver a satisfying - or even fully functional - shooter experience."
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	 Battleborn is one of the most chaotic shooters I've ever played, and true to form it managed to frustrate and amaze me at the same time. The single-player and co-op campaign hinges on a threadbare story, propelled by forgettable NPCs flailing with non-stop hit-or-miss jokes. The multiplayer attempts to fuse genres by mixing in MOBA mechanics and is sometimes successful, but also misses out on sorely needed online staples. And the entire package is led by a cast that constantly piques my curiosity due to the brilliant in-match leveling system. Each of Battleborn's two dozen characters has a fun look that creates an instant attraction, and the variety of their abilities digs the claws in deeper. After dipping my toe in with the standard soldier Oscar Mike, the literally lumbering Montana made for a natural progression. Before you know it, I was moving onto stranger selections like the melee-focused human-demon hybrid Shayne & Aurox. What gives each of their ability sets depth and diversity beyond the initial character choice is that you begin every new excursion at level one and progress through 10 upgrade choices in the course of a single session, with the twist that you have to choose the upgrades on the fly, like in a MOBA.  One of the weirder characters I took a liking to was the multi-limbed magician Orendi. While her magical skills are fun to use at level 1, I liked having spur-of-the-moment choices to bolster them. Would the up-close Nullify attack work better if it automatically launched Orendi out of range of an enemy’s retaliatory attacks, or if it immediately recharged her shield so she could take that hit instead? Would her damaging Shadowfire Pillar cause more devastation with a wider range or if a second, less-powerful pillar could be immediately deployed afterward? With Oscar Mike, you can end up with a precision-focused fighter with sniper-scope and laser-strike upgrades or take more of a spray-and-pray approach by using a laser sight on your rifle and a wider bombardment strike as upgrade alternatives. When a team is in desperate need of revives and an extra gun, weird choices like whether Montana's health regenerates faster as his chaingun is heating up or cooling down can become abnormally stressful. It's a sensation I've rarely encountered with shooter campaigns, and I have to say, I liked the extra tactical level added to these frantic battles on top of the unique feel it gave to each character.   Battleborn's seven-hour campaign lives and dies by the quality of its eight stages, which are mostly repetitive with the exception of some standout moments. Each one is essentially continuous waves of samey enemies broken up with more creative boss battles and/or base-defense sequences. Using currency (called shards) you collect on each map, you also have to purchase turrets and bots to aid in your attack against giant mechs or base defense, which adds an interesting layer of resource management. With all of that action, the actual story Battleborn is trying to tell becomes background noise.  This is a Gearbox game, so of course the makers of Borderlands couldn’t resist adding loot as well, though in this case you earn new gear in between battles. While Battleborn's loot carries over from match to match, the bonuses you get out of it aren't as high-impact as the in-match leveling system. They still do a good job of adding to the intensity of the combat, though. Most loot items (earned after campaign levels and multiplayer matches, but also purchasable with points you earn in every mode) are stat bonuses that you can put into a three-item loadout and apply to your character over the course of a stage, provided you have the shards to activate them. Giving the shards a second use outside of activating deployable allies makes for a nice pull between using shards for the immediate good of your team with turrets and bots or being slightly greedy to upgrade your character's speed, firepower, or health regeneration. With all of that action, the actual story Battleborn is trying to tell becomes background noise. It’s all disembodied voices talking to each other from portraits in the corners of the screen, and since you rarely exposition-spouting NPC characters in the flesh, it never means much. It doesn't help that with a story about warring factions uniting to save the one remaining hospitable planet against a galaxy-conquering force, everyone seems to be hyper and full of jokes when you'd expect most folks to treat the scenario seriously. As a result, I never felt any sense of urgency during the campaign. The visual style, humor, and development team force comparisons to the Borderlands series, but Battleborn's plot and tone never quite reaches those same endearing heights. While there are some rare chuckleworthy lines and the animated intro and ending gave me fond flashbacks to Aeon Flux, the overall storytelling didn't land as much as I expected it to.  Some stages, like the opening salvo through an arctic base, a trap-filled ruin where one wrong move means death, and the final, frantic stage are the kind of co-op experiences I'll gladly return to with friends to grind and unlock new characters. However, others that required multiple back-and-forth runs to defend bases are one-and-done for me, especially since a destroyed base means repeating the entirety of a 40-minute level. Losing a campaign level because the shared lives pool was depleted is fair and something that's a culmination of futility; having half an hour of progress flushed away because you took your eye off a defense point for a few seconds can feel unfair. Keep in mind that this is the style of game that, while the entirety of the campaign can be tackled on a solo basis, is really not built to played alone. Without any partners to revive you, the amount of extra lives is depleted much quicker; but even worse is that some levels seem nigh-impossible with certain hero types. I wouldn't be foolhardy enough to attempt to solo a level with the healing-focused Miko and his piddling knives, but there are less-intuitive traps like taking the strong swordsman Rath and his grounded attacks and finding them all but useless against a spider mech that then grows a floating head. Fortunately I was with a team at the time, but the prospect of using his meager projectile special attack and jumping while flailing his sword like a madman would have made the battle a lost cause.   Where the campaign feels familiar and soulless, there's a lot of imagination on display in the three PvP modes. Capture is a familiar domination-style mode good for fast action. Incursion is kind of a condensed version of Battleborn's campaign that smartly avoids those overly long battles as you enter the opposition's territory to take down their mechs with your own firepower and any robot minions you may have purchased. Where the campaign feels familiar and soulless, there's a lot of imagination on display in the three PvP modes.  The third mode, Meltdown, is Battleborn's well-meaning but ultimately flawed mixture of MOBA and arena FPS gameplay. The big issue is that Battleborn's first-person perspective means the action is too close and the map overlay is too small to keep track of any nearby deployables and enemy locations on top of keeping your head on straight regarding your own health, level, and currency to purchase said deployables. Also, while it would have been nice to pit these diverse heroes against each other in more straightforward modes like Team Deathmatch or free-for-all, there isn’t one to be found. The last thing that bothered me was that while all the maps are well tailored to fit each mode, they're all lacking in substantial indoor locales where the melee-focused characters can thrive. Even though multiplayer maps and modes are scarce, at least they're all instantly available – unlike the hero roster, which left me wanting access to more characters earlier. At the outset, the seven heroes to choose from are a bit paltry, especially when three are the standard gun-toting soldier types that don’t do a great job of showcasing the diversity of the larger cast. The entirety of the seven-hour campaign will net you four more, and it'll take another two or three hours to start unlock characters via multiplayer or by generally leveling up your overall profile. It's made for a pretty thin cast of characters in multiplayer matches during the opening week of Battleborn's release, but I hope the modes are still active when players start earning the higher-level characters.  With well over a dozen hours with Battleborn I've only earned access to roughly half of the cast, which doesn't feel enough for the effort I’ve put in. On the bright side, it keeps me driven to progress, albeit slowly. I'm a bit more flummoxed about the customization options that come with more specialized work. You can unlock new outfits and taunts for Battleborn's heroes by either leveling up that specific character or by completing specific tasks (like successfully using a particular skill or winning a number of multiplayer matches) but they're all viewable in the character information menu and most just amount to a different colored character instead of interesting new outfits you'd see in the likes of Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare. The cast of Battleborn is fantastic; I've enjoyed exploring the ins and outs of characters like the steampunk sniper Marquis and fungal healer Miko, and every time I play I'm focused on earning further access to the unique roster. However, there’s no interesting story for them to take part in, and a lack of interesting stages and multiplayer modes inspiring me to power through the slow unlocking process. I'll return to the half of the campaign that doesn’t feel unfair and repetitive and enjoy two thirds of the scant multiplayer modes, but I can't help but feel Battleborn still has a lot of room to grow.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	 The Park is a brief, atmospheric horror experience that provides a solid dose of scares without ever really bothering to attempt to reinvent the wheel. What starts with the simple, slightly-cheesy premise of a mother trying to find her son in an abandoned amusement park quickly morphs into a chilling and personal horror story. Mechanically, The Park is cut from the same cloth as first-person, story-driven games like Gone Home and PT. You walk around and examine various nick-nacks throughout the world meant to help flesh out the story -- newspaper clippings, creepy dolls, a child's shoe. However, unlike Gone Home, the Park’s objects aren’t especially interesting, and don’t do a whole lot to add depth to the characters or the world.   Thankfully, most of these aren’t required in order to experience any of The Park’s many, many jump-scares. Despite a lot of these being easy to spot from a mile away, I still found myself yelping out loud numerous times throughout the 90-minute adventure, thanks in part to the excellent sound design and smart camera movement. Ambient noises, audio distortions, and generally creepy carnival music all work together to create a really evocative atmosphere. Likewise, The Park will oftentimes limit your field of view, only to whip-pan you around to come face-to-face with some sort of chilling ghoul. Also scattered across The Park are attractions that take control away from you and deliver a scripted spooky vignette. While there’s generally a solid payoff at the end of each one, I found that most of them went on far too long without the ability to hop off. Particularly offensive is the Hansel and Gretel boat ride that gets its point across in 60 seconds, then proceeds to go on for another five minutes or so without allowing you to opt out.   Visually, The Park has some effective lighting techniques, and objects generally look great from a distance. However, examining certain structures up-close reveal some muddy textures, and I noticed objects occasionally popped in and out of the world depending on the angle you were looking at them across all three platforms. Certainly not enough to pull me out of the experience, but definitely noticeable. While the first half of The Park tends to lean a bit too hard into the horror tropes of a spooky carnival, the final act does a really great job of developing a character with the pathos that comes from being a mother who’s having a tough time dealing with the impossible stress that comes from being a parent. Sure, it’s some of the same ground that Silent Hill games have covered in the past, but that doesn’t diminish its effectiveness. I didn’t expect such real and personal themes when I first entered The Park, but I was definitely happy with the narrative depth I eventually found. The Park doesn’t really bring anything new to the horror table, but honestly, that’s okay. Its 90 minutes are filled with an impressive atmosphere, interesting themes, and spooky places to poke around. While some of the attractions are a bit long in the tooth, The Park provides enough tension and scares to warrant a playthrough from any horror fan.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	 Part quaint Italian seaside town, part sprawling mansion, and part high-tech underground cave lair, Hitman’s second episode – Sapienza – is about as James Bond as the Hitman series has ever been. It’s an excellent level brimming with experimentation potential that will provide hours and hours of gameplay. Dressed for the Italian summer in a crisp white, tucked shirt pilfered from Daniel Craig’s wardrobe, if it weren’t for his distinct lack of hair 47 probably wouldn’t look out of place easing an Aston Martin up to the nearest hotel and seducing the concierge. Double-O Forty Seven, perhaps.   Either way, Sapienza is a vastly more expansive experience than the previous level, Paris (reviewed here). While large and bustling with partygoers, staff, and equipment, Paris is still a single building and its immediate grounds. Sapienza, in contrast, is not just an expensive villa with an infectious disease lab facility attached; it’s everything around it too. There’s a village square lined with cafés and small stores. There are narrow cobbled streets that wind down to a small church, morgue, and a modest cemetery overlooking the ocean. There’s also a picturesque beach and seaside shopping area; from here you can access the town’s underground tunnels or wind your way past the jetty to discover a ruined fort. All of this is outside the large mansion and secret lair that houses both of 47’s targets, plus his additional objective.  Investigating the massive Sapienza level and prodding for access opportunities and weaknesses is extremely satisfying. It’s huge. Intimidatingly so, at first, but slowly uncovering each of the many avenues that will bring 47 to his targets is always half the fun of the classic Hitman experience. It’s no different here, although that fun lasts longer considering the drastically bigger scope of Sapienza compared to even the best Hitman levels of old. Investigating the massive Sapienza level and prodding for access opportunities and weaknesses is extremely satisfying; it’s a very well-honed illustration of developer Io’s commitment to building non-linear environments that really tap into the spirit of what has always made Hitman great and unique. Sapienza does this even better than Paris; there’s even more variety here, both in the place itself and in the situations 47 will find himself in. One moment he’s hovering around an ice cream parlour disguised as a waiter, avoiding the staff and trying to tamper with one particular patron’s coffee; the next he’s clad in a HazMat suit infiltrating a high-tech, high-security lab chamber on the hunt for a dangerous supervirus. During one attempt I went from hiding in plain sight as a corpse in an open coffin to posing as a golf instructor in order to kill my target while he was taking time out to perfect his drive. This happened within 15 minutes, and that was before I found the incredibly dastardly exploding golf ball. These are the sort of dark yet comical mini stories that can be weaved here. Don’t expect much in the way of an actual story, though; a single, short cutscene delivered upon the successful completion of the mission is all we get to move the overarching narrative along. Unfortunately it’s already proving difficult to get invested in a story told in minute-or-so bursts, several weeks apart – and we’re only at the second episode.   Sapienza continues to build on the Hitman: Blood Money/Hitman: Absolution hybrid gameplay Io established in the first episode. Like Paris, Sapienza is bursting at the seams with ways of getting the job done, and the more you explore the world, the more useful items, disguises, and people reveal themselves. Sapienza demands many successful attempts to unlock all the gear and new mission starting locations available, and some of my early, patient playthroughs took close to an hour apiece. Even trying to rush through like an indiscriminate thug will take time, considering how spread out and tough to access the objectives can be. Overall it’s a more complex hit than Paris, and slightly trickier as a result.   Sleepy Sapienza lacks the visual spectacle and flash of last month’s ostentatious Paris fashion show level but the change of pace makes it worth it. I recommend checking out the level from the church steeple, too; the panoramic view you get up there really helped inject proceedings with a real sense of 47 being a lone, invisible killer in a big world. That said, I found true immersion was hampered by the voice acting, which fails on all fronts to feel authentic due the overwhelming abundance of American English accents. It was a mild annoyance in last month’s Paris level, but it’s a far bigger one here. This may look like Italy, but it doesn’t sound like it at all. It’s thoroughly jarring walking into a charming Italian corner store barbershop and finding nobody sounds remotely Italian. It’s far from gamebreaking but the atmosphere definitely suffers. Pleasingly, the menus aren’t troubled with the same frustrating lag that plagued the interface at the launch of the debut episode, and the often horrifically long loading times from Paris have been trimmed. Hitman Episode 2: Sapienza is a fantastic follow-up to the promising first episode; huge, bursting with deadly promise, and begging for many, many playthroughs. The lack of much meaningful local voice acting is a disappointing miss, however, and that might really start undermining Hitman’s jetsetting international atmosphere in later levels if it’s not addressed.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	 Credit where it’s due: Rise of the Tomb Raider’s DLC continues to differentiate itself from the main game with new ideas. Although new Expedition Mode Cold Darkness Awakened isn’t quite enough of a challenge to sit comfortably under a ‘survival horror’ moniker , it’s a fun and frantic hour-long experience which eschews Tomb Raider’s usual bad-guys-with-guns for a horde of far less predictable subterranean zombies.   Lara’s new foes are certainly relentless. As you make your way through an old soviet compound, avoiding your enemies, not confronting them, is key. If Lara is spotted, there’s little to do but run as a multitude of them will pursue you at once, lobbing explosives, teeth bared. It’s a great respite from Lara’s usual run-and-gun method of despatch, and makes for tense traversal. It’s a shame, then, that the compound itself isn’t very interesting. Cold Darkness Awakened tasks you with shutting down the viral oubreak in three separate chemical production towers, and getting to them is relatively straightforward. You’ll be asked to rescue prisoners or hunt down weapon caches, but such tasks aren’t particularly exciting, and there’s no real reason to linger bar score-chasing for Expedition credits. I’d recommend adding cards to your game - particularly health-limiting ones - to add a little more excitement and longevity to proceedings. Still, once inside, the chemical compounds are a lot of fun. Over radio, series regular Nadia will frantically issue instructions on how to deal with the various pumps, levers and fuse boxes that have to be manipulated in order to shut down the virus, all while hordes of ‘the infected’ shamble around you. That Nadia gets increasingly flustered adds a great sense of that everything is quickly spiraling out of control. Cold Darkness Awakened climaxes in an explosive scenario where Lara is tasked to shoot a number of pistons while being attacked from all sides. Though ’shoot the red things’ is an overly-familiar piece of game design, the waves of enemies here are relentless enough that it never stops being enjoyable, especially if you’re using Lara’s very effective shotgun.  Cold Darkness Awakened is a welcome change of pace to Rise of the Tomb Raider’s usual rhythms. Though its gameworld isn’t particularly interesting, it does a great job at escalating tension and resolves Lara’s fight against an infected horde with an explosive climax.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	 The main characters of Quantum Break may frequently find themselves stuck in time, yet developer Remedy Entertainment appears to have no such problem. The team behind Max Payne and Alan Wake has successfully managed to evolve its signature style of cinematic shoot-’em-up for its latest release; seamlessly melding digital gunplay and TV-inspired storytelling without compromising the quality of either side of the experience. While I wish the combat stakes had been raised a little higher in its second half, Quantum Break remains a stylish and often-exhilarating third-person shooter wrapped up in a tautly paced tale of time travel. Consisting of five gameplay acts interspersed with four breakneck-paced episodes of a live-action TV-style show, Quantum Break opens - as so many great sci-fi stories do - with a catastrophic accident in a research lab, one that creates a potentially world-ending fracture in time and imbues (or perhaps, infects) both the hero and his chief antagonist with time-bending powers.    In the hands of hero Jack Joyce, this satisfying suite of superpowers work in tandem with more traditional cover-based shooter mechanics to take the bullet time of Remedy’s original Max Payne games to... Well, the max. Joyce can blink-teleport from one side of the room to the other, slowing down time long enough to blindside an enemy with a shotgun blast. He can momentarily suspend an enemy in a time bubble, unload a full submachine gun clip into it, and allow the bubble to burst so that two dozen headshots all arrive at once. He can create an impenetrable time shield, sprint past sniper fire like the Flash, and even charge up and hurl ‘time bombs’ to scatter groups of enemies like shrieking dandelion spores. The downside to such a range is that half a dozen different cooldown timers on screen are easily mixed up during the heat of a battle.  Frequent stutters in time create eye-popping dioramas out of the destruction around you. While it’s still grounded amidst the typical shooter tropes - every warehouse area seems to have taken a fresh delivery from Acme Explosive Barrel Company, for example - Quantum Break does facilitate some truly unique playgrounds for its time-stopping action to unfold in. Frequent stutters in time create eye-popping dioramas out of the destruction around you. Dispatched enemies cartwheel back from bullet impacts and freeze in midair, the bloodspray from their exit wounds crystallizing in the air like icicles of claret. Out-of-control cars become trapped in an infinite instant replay as they crash, rewind, and crash again. Innocent bystanders are caught in a state of suspended animation, their morning coffee spilling into a frozen arc in front of their stunned faces. It’s a unique and wonderfully eerie environment to inhabit - like wandering around inside a 3D screenshot - and certainly a stylish space in which to live out your every violent, Wachowski-inspired whim.  Enemy henchman one minute, exotic art installation the next. The only problem is that Jack goes from unassuming everyman to heat-packing superhero in the space of the first few hours, and his relatively rapid ascent to gun-toting Time Lord is to Quantum Break’s slight detriment as a whole. Since it seems to be in such a rush to give you all these neat powers up front, it leaves nothing new in reserve for the entire second half, which means the initial freshness of these frozen-in-time firefights starts to feel somewhat stale long before you reach the conclusion after 10 hours. Some measures are taken to spice things up along the way, such as the introduction of enemies that can teleport like Joyce, and of course the obligatory tank-like troops who turn up to soak up an obnoxiously above-average amount of bullets, but for the most part your tactics remain the same right up to and including the final confrontation. While there is a superficial upgrade system that incrementally improves Joyce’s existing powers, I wish the introduction of the powers themselves had been spread out over Quantum Break’s duration to offer a more gradual sense of character progression. Failing that, it’s a shame there aren’t more interesting new ways to use his powers in the later levels in order to evolve the action a bit more in the second half. As it is, it’s a case of too much too soon, and it eventually becomes a touch repetitive.    What kept me playing despite the waning combat novelty was the strength of Quantum Break’s story, and the method by which it’s told. Tales of time travel are inherently paradoxical, but Quantum Break’s spin on the idea serves up some meaty twists and turns without ever becoming convoluted. Part of that is due to the way that at the end of each gameplay act a ‘juncture’ occurs, wherein you’re temporarily given control of the villain, Paul Serene. Serene has the ability to foresee the consequences of his actions, and thus you’re given a choice between two outcomes that will directly impact the subsequent episode of the live-action series, and have later in-game ramifications. These choices are never black and white, and adding to their complexity is the fact you have to weigh up how they’ll impact both Quantum Break’s heroes, and villains. For example, after the initial accident at the university you’re given the choice of creating a smear campaign to make Joyce look like a terrorist in the media, or alternatively slaughtering the students protesting the closure of the campus library and making the public fear Serene’s Monarch corporation.
Kallie Plagge	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	 Update: Stardew Valley has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  My favorite thing about Stardew Valley is not just that there’s a lot to see and do, but that it’s (almost) all intertwined. It’s not apparent at first — when I started my farm, I planned each tile for maximum efficiency and reset when I accidentally bought the wrong seeds. But the secret of the Valley is that it’s much more than making each day productive on the farm alone. As I ventured off my plot of 16-bit land and started to explore, I began to really enjoy the days for everything they are — and how its parts fit together to build a captivating rural life. Each day in Stardew Valley takes around 10 to 20 real minutes, and several of them are occupied by the slow business of starting a farm from scratch. Having to plant the right seeds, water your crops, and wait for the harvest before making any real money means there’s not a lot to do right away. Fitting, since my character had just left a stifling job at the Joja Corporation — Stardew Valley’s ever-present reminder that capitalism can grow soulless — for a simpler life on grandpa’s old farm. But Stardew Valley isn’t simple. It’s relaxed, sure, and lets you grow at your own pace, but it’s a rich world once you get past the slow first season.    Life in Stardew Valley’s Pelican Town picked up for me around summer of the first year — by then I’d gained access to fishing, exploring the mines, and enough money to start investing in livestock. Things really started to come together, and that initial simplicity evolved into a quiet sort of busyness. I grew crops so that I could prepare the best food, which I could in turn give as gifts to win over the townsfolk or to take down with me into the mine to restore my health as I fought monsters to get resources, which I could use to build a useful item back on my farm. I then used ore from the mines to upgrade my tools so I could chop up a log and get to a secret part of the Valley, and all that work helped me level up so I could craft even better items. The blend of RPG and farm sim feels effortless, and it makes Stardew Valley exciting and compelling without being stressful.  The blend of RPG and farm sim feels effortless.  All of those RPG-like sidequests are crucial, because they interrupt the inherent cyclical repetition of farming that can stall the momentum of farm sims. Over 30 hours and an in-game year later, I still feel like I have plenty of items to unlock and secrets to uncover. You’re pushed down multiple paths, too, because a lot of items acquired through farming, fishing, and mining, combine for huge rewards and unlock important areas of the Valley. That helps keep very separate tasks connected.   Most of these tasks would become old quickly if you did only that, but the need to change up your activities keeps things from becoming stale, and there’s usually more to them than it initially seems. The simple hack-and-slash combat in the mines is a bit of a grind and not particularly challenging, but the fun comes from the mystery of what comes next and the satisfaction of finding the right items for whatever else I needed and wanted to do. I spent a lot of rainy days and time between harvests underground, fighting slime monsters and skeletons and getting really excited every time I found a rare, useful ore. The solemn, pretty music helped keep me from getting stressed about combat and instead let me focus on the beauty of the underground.   When I wasn’t busy tracking down items or figuring out which crops were the best to grow each season, I tried to socialize around town. It wasn’t easy or even all that rewarding at first — even the friendlier townspeople wouldn’t open up to a complete stranger, which is admittedly pretty realistic. When they did, I was a bit disappointed at how basic the process of getting to know them was — “making friends” is as simple as making daily small talk, trial-and-error gift-giving, and doing random favors, and I did a lot of that, with varying degrees of success, and eventually forced my way to popularity.  The mechanics of relationships don't match the depth of the townspeople's lives.  It’s frustrating, because the mechanics of forming relationships don’t at all match the depth of the townspeople and their interconnected lives. One quest tasked me with finding the mayor’s “shorts,” which ended up being somewhere very scandalous. One kid spends a lot of time in his room because he thinks his mom and stepdad favor his step sister over him, and another girl has a strained relationship with her mom because of her “alternative” lifestyle. Festivals and cutscenes in particular made me feel less like I was just gaming a system. Once I’d gotten a girl’s heart meter up enough — which indicated that I’d given her enough of the right presents, I guess — she told me all about wanting to be a successful artist and how her ex didn’t support her. There’s also a homeless man, Linus, who is completely ostracized by most of the town’s residents. I watched a grumpy old man yell at him for digging through the trash for food and another man in town offer to give him food if he needed it, and as I befriended him (by giving him meals I’d cooked), I learned more and more about his struggles and successes in living off the land. Even though becoming his friend was uncomplicated, being his friend felt more meaningful.   What would’ve been even more meaningful is if there were something more I could do with this intimate information and these relationships. Marriage is one way to go, and your partner can even get jealous if you give gifts to other previous romance options. That route just doesn’t feel fleshed out quite enough, though learning the ins and out of Stardew Valley’s social aspect is still rewarding as a piece of fiction that fits relatively well into the more developed parts of rural life.   By Miranda Sanchez - December 13, 2016 Stardew Valley's transition to consoles is a smooth one. Both the PS4 and Xbox One versions include the great post-launch updates we've seen in the PC version, like the new farm templates, divorce, bug fixes, and more romance options. The controller mapping is taken from the PC version, so they're familiar, but the mouse cursor that's used to navigate menus is a little on the slow side. Still, most of my time was spent farming, talking with neighbors, or in dungeons, so this wasn't a deterrent for me when playing these versions. Unfortunately, Xbox One version does suffer from some slight stuttering in larger areas like the farm, but developer Chucklefish confirms that there is a planned update to fix it within the coming weeks. Otherwise, Stardew Valley for consoles is still the same great game we first played on PC, and comes just as highly recommended. After dozens of hours, I’m nowhere near done with everything in Stardew Valley. One note I found on my farm promised an important event in my third year, I still don’t know what’s at the bottom of the mine, and I need to figure out who I want to marry. With so many interconnected systems, from the farm simulation to simple combat and cooking to crafting, and each driving the others forward in some way, it’s a deeper and more complex game than you’d expect after the first day on the farm. There’s plenty to do while I wait to uncover more of the Valley’s secrets, and the prospect of filling my days with new adventures or just a better harvest is too enticing to pass up.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/trackmania-turbo-review	 Refined and responsive, Trackmania Turbo is a fun, fast, and colourful arcade racer/physics puzzler crammed with tight controls, smooth and crisp looks, and a genuinely surprising amount of solo and multiplayer content. More than that, it’s compulsive. That’s best exemplified by a course you race early on that says it can be completed in less than 20 seconds. It’s a single corner, a gentle slalom, a large jump that can’t be taken at full throttle (thanks to a letterbox-esque gap,) and two turbo-boost pads on the landing ramp. That’s it. Yet of all Turbo’s terrific and tricky stages, this one is a highlight for me. It was haunting me. I couldn’t find the fractions of a second I needed to break my personal-best time. Every extra centimetre between my car and the wall on the first corner was time lost. Every unnecessary degree of steering input snaking through the slalom was time lost. Every excessive bit of speed leaving the jump resulted in a late landing and cost me more crucial hundredths of a second. I don’t know how many restarts I made – well over 100; maybe double that. I was consumed by it. This is how Turbo works – how it burrows its way under the skin. Just one more restart. Just one more medal. Just one more spot on the leaderboards.  Trackmania Turbo’s greatest victory is perhaps its ability to be both incredibly simple and extremely deep. It’s very easy to pick up and begin driving – go, stop, and turn are the extent of its straightforward control scheme – but it’s anything but superficial. Beneath that instant accessibility lurks a truly nuanced world of consistent physics that needs to be adapted to for any hope of setting record times.  Trackmania Turbo’s greatest victory is perhaps its ability to be both incredibly simple and extremely deep. You need to know when to drift, and at what speeds it’s faster not to drift. You need to know at what angle powersliding up on two wheels is acceptable, and at what angle it’ll result in a disastrous rollover. You need to appreciate that once you’re in the air you’re completely at the mercy of your take-off angle; precision is paramount when you’re aiming for a narrow bridge hundreds of metres away from the apex of a jump, or a colossal quarter pipe across a yawning gap. It feels good to dip in and play Turbo but it feels even better to really tame it. What’s more, the handling dynamics vary across the four different vehicles available (each restricted to its own track environment) and the surfaces across which they race. The NASCAR Modified-style racer is my favourite car by far; composed at absurd speeds and capable of long, predictable powerslides it’s a perfect fit for the snaking bends, huge jumps, and gigantic vert ramps and loops of Turbo’s ‘Canyon Grand Drift’ location. I’ve also enjoyed the F1-inspired open-wheeler, which feels planted and grippy. It competes in an entirely different set of courses, the ‘International Stadium’, which is packed with futuristic elevated raceways, massive stunt objects, and supercross-style dirt sections. The huge number of national flag liveries for these are a cute touch. I’m less enamoured with the two remaining vehicles – a Baja-style Beetle racer and a stubby dune buggy – both of which I found a bit too fussy and twitchy to enjoy as much, even after several days to get used to them. The dune buggy, in particular, feels like a slot car on the magnetic, gravity-defying stretches of raised track at Turbo’s ‘Rollercoaster Lagoon’ but I grew to truly dislike how it copes with sand or polished timber decking, both of which might as well be ice. I certainly concede varied grip levels are a carefully designed part of the challenge but there were several courses I eventually found more frustrating than fun as a result of this.   Turbo’s progression system is actually very linear, forcing players to work through 10 events per location, and 40 total to open the next tier of events. The minor annoyance here is that this means after completing a series of 10 ‘Grand Canyon Drift’ events, the next 10 ‘Grand Canyon Drift’ courses are gated pending the completion of 30 entirely separate events in the remaining three environments. I do wonder whether it would’ve been more logical to allow us to progress through single locations after success in them, rather than making access to the next batch of tracks at one particular environment contingent entirely on 30 more medals all gleaned elsewhere. To Turbo’s credit, however, even when I found myself somewhat impatient at the forced switching of locales and vehicles, it’s rarely irritating. A large part of that is the length of the tracks themselves, which mostly range between 30 to 60 seconds (it takes trial and error to be able to complete them within the required times but the restart button is instant). Developer Nadeo has also wedged in a system allowing us to effectively secure a medal and move on from courses that are proving troublesome provided we can earn the medal below it three times. Anakin was right; sand sucks. There’s a staggering 200 of these courses spread across the four areas but after factoring in Turbo’s fully-featured track maker system this is really just the tip of the proverbial iceberg. The track maker is available in several levels of construction complexity (beginners can just bung a bunch of pre-made pieces together like a virtual Scalextric set while experts can hone every track tile and billboard) or you can just let it create tracks for you automatically. The auto-generated stages are a bit of a crapshoot – the ones my game created were sometimes a bit of a mess – but the tools are definitely there to create tracks as wildly fun and frantic as the ones the Nadeo has crafted itself. The big miss here is the unforgivable lack of any obvious in-game browser for user-created tracks, which instead need to be selected from a website and fed to your game via some Ubisoft Club bollocks.   Alongside Turbo’s mammoth assortment of tracks lies its terrifically broad multiplayer component. There’s the bizarre but fun Double Driver mode, which places control of a single car in the hands of two separate players and applies their inputs evenly (even when they cancel each other out). There’s four-player splitscreen (a wonderful and welcome relic of the glorious era of same screen multiplayer that most developers have forgotten even existed) which seems smoothly handled without any glaringly obvious technical concessions.  Best of all, however, is the online multiplayer racing where up to 100 players are competing in real-time to set the best time on any given track. The result is a mad torrent of ghost cars flowing around twisting tracks like a school of frightened fish. The first 30 seconds are always hilarious as dozens of players fall foul to the same unexpected obstacles simultaneously. I did encounter a frustrating bug here on PlayStation 4; at the conclusion of a race my current ranking information was displayed on screen but refused to disappear before the next event started, leaving a slab of white text obscuring the subsequent race. It only disappeared when I left the room and rejoined the event. I do love how granular this ranking info is, though, and for me it was the prime reason I became completely obsessed with the course I described at the beginning of this review. Not only could I see where I ranked in the world, but I could also see where I ranked in Australia, and even where I ranked in my home state. My complaint here would be although it’s clear how many players are still above you, Turbo doesn’t make the effort post-race to show you their exact times so it’s never obvious just how much faster you need to be to ascend the leaderboards. A brilliant and beautiful stunt driving masterclass, Trackmania Turbo is fast, frenetic, fun, and only occasionally frustrating. If this generously proportioned and highly engaging arcade racer gets its talons into you the way it did me, it’ll have you compulsively chasing ghosts for ages.
John Robertson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	 Ronda Rousey and Conor McGregor's starring roles on the cover of EA Sports' latest attempt at recreating the world of the Ultimate Fighting Championship is fitting. These are two of the sport's most renowned stars; blessed with the precision, dedication and desire required to lift them to championship glory. Yet in their latest respective fights they both lost to opponents most expected them to beat. They've got the moves and the talent, but in the vital moment they failed to improvise and fell apart. EA Sports UFC 2 is no different. The real UFC is full of sentimental, if brutal, glory. An underdog can get lucky and beat the champion with the first strike of a bout. The most enduring star can win in a way that no one has ever seen before, furthering strengthening their legend. Ronda Rousey beat Cat Zingano in 14 seconds using a combination of dodge, counterattack and submission that most would think impossible. Such moments of shock and awe don't happen here. UFC 2 is too sterile, too rigid, and too predictable to ever feel like a genuine representation of a sport that has built a dedicated audience thanks in large part to the reality that anything can happen at any moment.   Of course, replicating this most fundamental aspect of sport is no easy feat for any video game - particularly one that must simultaneously offer both balance for casual players and hardcore simulation. It's reasonable to expect to be able to tangle with one another and have the superior, more skilled player coming out on top. Having the more skilled competitor being defeated by the first strike landed against them (whether that's in the first round or the third) simply wouldn't be fair in terms of game balance.   So instead of attempting to be a genuine recreation of the UFC, then, developer EA Canada's approach is to provide an accurate representation of mixed martial arts' core mechanics within a visual wrapper that is impressive to behold. In this regard, UFC 2 can be considered a success.  This is one of the most visually impactful sports games ever made. Likewise, without question this is one of the most visually impactful sports games ever made, competing with NBA 2K when it comes to athlete likenesses and FIFA in terms of animation variety. Every tattoo adorning McGregor appears to be within a single pixel of accuracy, every one of Rousey's tightly packed upper-body muscles flexes powerfully as each jab is thrown. Combine this with the sheer variety of attacks at your disposal and it was nearly impossible to not be impressed by the visual spectacle even after hours of play under my belt.    Throw a punch during this momentary disconnect with reality and you're treated to seeing a professional fighter look like a drunk. Awkward moments are thrown up, as they were in EA Sports' 2014 UFC release, when a fighter's position is quickly and dramatically altered. This is particularly noticeable after you've just dropped your foe to the canvas with a solid strike, it Takes a second for your fighter to register that the target is no longer standing right in front of them. Throw a punch during this momentary disconnect with reality and you're treated to seeing a professional fighter look like a drunk as they harmlessly swat away at the air in front of their face.   Otherwise, the animations have been masterfully constructed in a manner that allows you total control over individual actions. It's when you're on your feet that things are at their most powerful; the best strikers able to execute combos as fast and as accurately as you can input them. Softening up your opponent with a few leg kicks before peppering the head and body with punches is an art unto itself and, as long as you pit yourself against quality opposition, one that takes significant practise to execute flawlessly. Take the fight to ground with a wrestling or Brazilian jujitsu specialist, however, and the action is less impressive. Transitioning between positions of varying levels of dominance is assigned to the right stick, as it was in the 2014 UFC, with the 'full mount' position tending to represent the hallowed ground from which fights are generally won. Welcomingly, when the fight hits the mat a small icon appears indicating which position each stick movement will seek to secure. This takes away the boorish memorisation that was needed in the past and allows you to concentrate solely on outwitting your opponent and manipulating their body in such a way as to make defence difficult.   However, while the mechanics are well thought out in isolation, the end result is simply too strict and controlled to allow free-flowing combat. In reality, the best ground fighters move seamlessly, and often unpredictably, in an attempt to catch their opposite number off guard. The likes of Chris Weidman and Fabricio Werdum are, in reality, able to interlock a number of skills into a single motion that leaves both spectator and opponent confused - that doesn't happen here. Once the best sequence of position changes has been found with a specific fighting style it becomes a matter of repeating that consistently in order to notch up victory after victory against the AI.   Game modes perfectly reflect this predictability; the usual slate of career mode, quick fights and online ladders standing front and centre. Career mode is especially underwhelming, as you must undertake simple training mini-games in a bid to improve your fighter and win matches to move towards a title shot. It's entirely perfunctory, nothing more. The most attention-grabbing new edition is Ultimate Team, an attempt to replicate the success EA Sports has seen through offering digital cards throughout the likes of FIFA and Madden. Here you can create a team of up to five custom-built fighters and compete with them, online or off, with a view to winning fights and collecting points that can be redeemed for packs of cards.  Spending points to acquire a new type of punch is less exciting. These cards unlock new attacks, fighting styles and stat boosts of varying levels of impact, which means that in comparison to Ultimate Team as seen in FIFA and Madden, the implementation here is underwhelming. There's little wrong with the underlying concept of adding a slight random element to career progression through not knowing what a pack might hold, but spending points to acquire a new type of punch is less exciting than ripping open a pack to find a playable Odell Beckham Jr. or Lionel Messi. Locking out fighters wasn’t going to work in this sport, given the comparatively smaller number of names featured here in comparison to team sport games, but withholding a punch from you until you've bought it rather than allowing you to earn it through training feels cynical and forced.   That is UFC 2's problem throughout: the fundamentals are right, but the spectacle and details that might have made it feel like the real thing are missing. The stand-up game might be technically brilliant, and the visuals genuinely eye catching, but it never lets itself go and allows its fists to fly. Everything is too structured, too robotic and, after 20 or 30 bouts, too predictable to tease you into suspending your disbelief and making you feel as though you're a UFC competitor. Ultimately, then, this is perhaps the best example yet of how difficult it is to simulate certain real-world activities within a video game. If UFC 2 really did try to 'be' the UFC then it would fail in terms a balanced fighting experience, so you could argue that it's simulation attempt is doomed from the start. That's not to say that actual UFC fights are random in their outcome, but there certainly does exist a constant potential for surprise within them. That surprise, and the excitement it generates, is what's missing here. While UFC 2 certainly looks the part, it doesn't feel it. Strikes are razor sharp, kicks are satisfyingly heavy, and each and every fighter is beautifully sculpted and recreated, but each and every element is too robotic and rigid to recreate the dynamism and unpredictability that draws me to real UFC fights. Those fights are often won by finding those spaces between the lines that your opponent hasn't thought to cover, but those spaces simply don't exist here. As a fighting game it's worth your time if you're seeking something other than the usual options, but as a recreation of the UFC it falters before the final bell.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/16/the-division-review	" It’s not too hard to find nice things to say about Tom Clancy’s The Division, especially as it unfurls in its strong opening hours: its open-world version of Manhattan is both gorgeous and authentic, its cover-based third-person combat is sound, and its RPG elements run surprisingly deep. And yet, next to every good thing The Division does, there hangs a big, ugly asterisk. That same open world is barren and unengaging, combat gets bogged down with samey waves of walking bullet sponges, and character progression is awkwardly fractured in inconvenient ways. Outside of the tension of the PvPvE Dark Zone, there’s little that makes this virtual Manhattan feel alive or dangerous. Visually, The Division leans heavily but very effectively on the all-too-familiar iconography of post-biological-disaster Manhattan. Coming out of an early security checkpoint, daylight blinded me until my “eyes” adjusted, and then I saw it: an improvised memorial to those who had given their lives trying to take Manhattan back from the chaos that's swallowed it in the wake of an unprecedented terror attack.  I’ve spent time in the real New York City, and in fact my father was in Manhattan on 9/11. I've seen memorials like this, littered with the helmets of fallen firefighters and hastily scrawled children's drawings with ""thank you"" writ large across the top. It is, perhaps, a cheap way to get me emotionally invested in the conflict that drives the fragmented story forward, but it worked – at least for a time. From the quaint Christmas lights in Chelsea to the ominously unlit Times Square, The Division is full of evocative visual moments. It never follows up on them in any substantive way, but they do manage to make the city itself the most interesting character in the cast.   But as full as the world is of eerily beautiful sights to see, it is equally devoid of worthwhile things to do. Imagine an open-world game with hardly any dynamic elements, or worse, a long-dead MMO where you and a handful of party members (should you invite folks along for some co-op) are the only people left on your server. That’s a solid approximation of how engaging of a play-space The Division’s Manhattan is. But as full as the world is of eerily beautiful sights to see, it is equally devoid of worthwhile things to do.  Enemy encounters are spread thin across the city like too little butter over too much bread, creating long stretches of eventless walking where very little happens. I’ve walked for minutes at a time without more than one or two small packs of easily dispatched thugs to entertain me. That would matter a lot less if there was more going on around me, but for a city of eight million that’s supposedly just been mortally wounded by a terror attack and subsequently overrun by multiple gangs of militarized fanatics, the streets are suffocatingly calm. That’s mostly owing to the fact that there are virtually no random events; just illusions of them. That detachment of peacekeeping troops getting into it with a gang of looters a block over sound like they're engaging in an impromptu skirmish, but it's all a scripted show for your benefit. Once you help them end it, they'll be on indefinite leave. Though some other IGN editors say they’ve seen gangs dynamically fighting in the world, in more than 50 hours played, I never did. What’s more, these pre-set, one-and-done missions are all minor variations of one of a few simple missions types, and once you’ve done all of them in a zone, there’s no material reason to come back to that location besides some inconsequential collectibles that I quickly gave up on grabbing, even when they were only steps out of my way.  All of this comes together with Manhattan’s grid-like structure to make the act of exploration tedious when it should be exciting. A good open world teases you off the path from A to B with the promise of discovery and emergent shenanigans; all I really got from The Division was a breadcrumb trail to follow through a series of 90-degree turns with some conveniently placed people to shoot at the end.   To its credit, shooting those unfortunate looters and mercenaries does feel pretty good, if a bit standard. The gunplay model is a few steps toward the technical realism of most Tom Clancy-branded games from the run-and-gun action of Gears of War, but not many. The only difference between the level 5 SCAR I used at the start of my journey and the level 28 version I ended it with were the size of the numbers that popped out of my enemy’s head.  Things like muzzle travel and bullet spread play a big enough role that guns feel distinct from one another. The M4, for instance, is the reliable mid-range stopgap you’d expect it to be, while the 7.62mm-spitting AK-47 starts bucking like a mule by the time the second or third round has left the muzzle. One is better for sustained fire; the other is best fired in short bursts to inflict maximum damage in a short span before ducking back behind cover. And cover is important, as is covering fire, since enemies can actually be properly suppressed by firing at them when they’re behind cover. Should you bring along a friend or three, this makes co-op tactics particularly rewarding, especially when one of your squadmates suppresses a deadly enemy sniper while you flank around and lace into them. However, the bullet-sponginess of the enemies, and their tendency to shrug off torrents of small arms fire without so much as flinching does rob the shooting of the tactile power that should come with unloading a street sweeper into some poor fool’s chest at point-blank. This exemplifies a larger set of problems that plague The Division: the clash between its grounded, realistic look and the conventions of RPG gameplay.  Years of virtual experience in other shooters have taught me that a Saiga-12 will send a person tumbling to the ground in one, maybe two shots, but here, that same gun might take a full clip to get the job done. Getting a Saiga-12 with better stats will obviously make them go down faster, but the problem is that good progression systems need more powerful motivation than just bigger numbers. The long-term gear game in most great RPGs relies on, among other things, a sort of lustful visual progression that makes you eager to see how the next drop will change the look of your character. But the only difference between the level 5 SCAR I used at the start of my journey and the level 28 version I ended it with were the size of the numbers that popped out of my enemy’s head. Weapons, enemy types, and even the gorgeous city itself all fell prey to this fatigue over the nearly 60 hours I played. The promise of the spectacular, of things you haven’t yet seen - these joys are rarely found in The Division’s combat, or in any other facet for that matter. By the end, it’s all one blur of masked men, Kalashnikovs, and smoking urban ruin.  Still, the mere fact that the action leans so heavily on sharp aim and smart tactics makes it rewarding when the last leathery-tough foe in a pack finally goes down. That goes double for the main story missions, which throw you headlong into some seriously heated firefights. The fact that the action leans so heavily on smart tactics makes it rewarding when the last foe in a pack finally goes down.  Here, the action is concentrated and highly demanding. Particularly with a squad of four using complementary skill loadouts, these sections are the highlights of The Division. Hunkering down behind a teammate’s deployed piece of cover with bullets whizzing overhead while one of my sentry turrets suppresses and stuns groups of enemies for another squadmate to light up with an incendiary seeker mine is a thrill. The promise of these kinds of moments ends up becoming the main reason to persevere through the banalities of The Division’s open world. Thankfully, you can easily matchmake and fast travel directly to these gems - a welcome convenience that allows you to bypass parts of the open-world slog. Not for long though. You’ll rarely come out of one mission with the gear, skills, and level to be successful in the next, so it’s back out onto those empty streets again to progress your character. The RPG elements in The Division are more interesting than I expected, but like everything else, they too have their problems."
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	 On his brief trip to Paris, this overhauled take on Agent 47 has successfully combined the best of his previous incarnations. Episode 1 of the new game, which will be released throughout the year and is simply called Hitman, contains a classic-style imaginative sandbox for lethal shenanigans, and the smoother movement controls of 2012’s Hitman: Absolution. There’s definitely the beginnings of something that may well emerge as a worthy successor to cult favourite Hitman: Blood Money here, although the AI is certainly still a few sandwiches short of a picnic and the PS4 version has displayed a mild smattering of technical snags so far.  Hitman certainly doesn’t waste time getting to it; the very brief opening cutscene during the prologue quickly gives way to a duo of straightforward training missions that provide your first taste of the revamped disguise system. The flawed disguise mechanic from Absolution has been mercilessly double-tapped and plonked in a dumpster; in Hitman the right disguise will fool most of those around you indefinitely, and is not tied to an in-game ability resource. For instance, in the second training level an aircraft mechanic’s duds will permit 47 to stroll directly into the CO’s office, collect a VIP, and assassinate him during a phony safety check that culminates in a deadly ejector seat, er, accident. In the Paris level, disguising yourself as a revered male model with an uncanny resemblance to 47 (make up and all) will allow you to access virtually every area of the building without being searched and secure a private meeting with one of the marks. The ability to truly hide in plain sight is a considerable part of what makes this new game feel like a classic Hitman game again, even if a lot of the fun still relies on the naïve AI being easy to exploit.  The ability to truly hide in plain sight is a considerable part of what makes this new game feel like a classic Hitman game again. I appreciated some of the small tweaks to NPC AI – for instance, in the Paris level guards will first escort you from restricted areas rather than display the more binary shoot-to-kill attitude of, say, Blood Money – and Hitman so far does a fine job of making its levels feel bustling and alive with people who have places to be and duties to perform. However, it is still the sort of experience that will let you lure a steady stream of nearby people, one by one, into a quiet bathroom with the sound of a repeatedly tossed crowbar (and it’s hard to argue their reactions to the growing pile of unconscious men in their underwear they each find inside are especially convincing).   While Hitman encourages multiple attempts at missions to discover all the different possibilities they offer I didn’t find myself particularly compelled to return to the training levels. I think it may be because the levels themselves are presented as somewhat hastily constructed and partially unpainted sets (and all the NPCs are ostensibly actors). I didn’t really connect with these “fake” levels. Episode 1’s Paris level, however, is a different story.  Paris is the main meal of Episode 1. Huge, dense, and absolutely brimming with devious ways to get the job done, Paris is like an enormous onion of assassination potential; each layer stripped reveals another. There are two targets, each with a whole host of ways to die. Over many, many playthroughs I’ve poisoned, choked, shot, sniped, drowned, and crushed my victims – once with an overhead lighting rig and once by pushing one target over a balcony to crush the other below – and I’ve still got untried methods to attempt. You can either explore, experiment, and eventually stumble across them in the environment, or get some killer pro-tips from the menu that details all the bonus points to be gleaned from snuffing out your targets in these varied ways. The new ‘Opportunities’ menu will also help you track down the steps to pull off some of the zanier hits. I found myself using a combination of both improvisation and getting inspiration from the game, though purists should note you can turn off in-game advice if you want to discover everything for yourself.  It’s quite admirable how much mileage Io Interactive squeezes out of a single environment. I was initially concerned about just how much gameplay we’d be able to milk from one level but it’s quite admirable the mileage Io Interactive squeezes out of a single environment. I certainly feel like I’ve mastered this Paris level more than all but my most-favourite classic Hitman series missions, and that’s perhaps the point. Every time you complete the hits you’re rewarded with new gear and new mission starting locations, which adds greatly to replayability. You need to replay the mission a lot to work through all the fatal outcomes so it helps that you can choose to begin undercover in various places around the building rather than walking through the front door dozens of times. It's especially important because again, besides the small training levels, this is the only map you get right now.   The customisable Contracts Mode also returns from Absolution and it feels like a better fit here than it was in the smaller, linear levels of the previous game. It’s quite simple to create and share your own hits by playing through the levels and marking NPCs as targets, and there’s already a small stream of user-created missions available. After playing the Paris level so many times I did, however, find myself a little lukewarm on the idea of going back into it looking for new targets. Perhaps a few months down the track, when the game has more available maps, Contracts Mode will be a more appealing way to revisit these levels.  Easily my biggest gripe on PS4 is the absolutely murderous loading times (over 60 seconds on occasions) and the general sluggishness of the menu screens (during my play sessions they’ve also developed an odd inability to actually load the required thumbnail images on-screen). When it comes to the Paris level the loading times are lengthy in all contexts, whether you’re loading it for the first time or simply starting from a recent save after being killed or messing up. You can save at will but it becomes deeply frustrating the more you attempt to prod the game’s simulation and experiment with outcomes, knowing messing up will trigger another long loading screen. I’m also confused by the fact saves made playing Hitman in its connected, online state aren’t compatible in the game’s offline environment. If you’re booted offline during play you’ll be yanked from your mission, wherever you are. I’d also recommend opting for the locked framerate in the options. The Paris map in particular is crammed with authentic detail, especially the backstage area packed with strutting models, busy stylists, cluttered make-up tables, and mirrors everywhere. The lightning is terrific too, and the runway at the centre of the show itself is a fantastic showcase for it, but overall I found I preferred the stability and smoothness of a locked frame rate over, say, the slight fluttering that would sometimes occur when panning across large crowds. One thing’s for sure: The more I've played Hitman’s debut “episode” the more I've enjoyed it. Despite the often boneheaded AI and dire loading times, Hitman has definitely combined the best of both worlds. There’s scope for it to improve in some areas as the levels are released throughout the year but this is a fun, confident start.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-review	 When it comes to shooter sequels, the delightfully animated and colorful Plants vs Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 shows just the kind of growth I like to see. Like a big juicy brain, there’s lots to chew on with a variety of single-player and multiplayer modes, maps, and customization options. While the simplicity and ease of use of the original quartet of characters on each side will be attractive to series newcomers and can certainly hold their own in battle, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2's biggest attraction are the six interesting new classes and their fun abilities. On the Plants side, Kernel Corn brings much-needed heavy firepower to the floral troops with a rocket launcher, gun-assisted rocket jump, and airstrike abilities, balanced out by his extremely slow movement. The orange-based Citron is almost the exact opposite; he’s very defense-based, with a temporary shield ability and a ball form that can get him out of action fast. The magic-using Rose is the real wild card, as she can slow down enemies, turn them into goats, or even very briefly turn into an apparition with a powerful attack. While Rose has a bit higher of a learning curve, she can be pretty useful once you master some of her weirder attacks.   If the Imp lives long enough, he can summon a powerful mech. As for the Zombies, there’s the melee-focused Super Brainz, who has extremely potent up-close attacks to compensate for underwhelming projectiles, and the Imp, who has extremely low health but – if he lives long enough – can summon a powerful mech every few minutes. If there’s one weak spot amongst the new crew, it’s Captain Deadbeard. He has a decent cannon attack, but his other abilities are done better by other troops and his primary weapon isn't quite up to snuff with the rest of the new recruits.   Then there’s the original set of four characters on each side, but they’ve been in short supply in online matches thus far for good reason; short of the healer class, there’s little beckoning a return to Garden Warfare’s founders when the new classes have so many more interesting things to do.  Across the board, Garden Warfare 2 could be a bit more welcoming to newcomers; instead of proper tutorials introducing each new skill, there are only brief videos without any text or dialogue to demonstrate, and it doesn’t give you much of an idea as to how they’re actually best used. If you're a complete newcomer, good luck – there are no such intros for the original Garden Warfare warriors.    I play an extra match here and there to earn enough for a more promising pack. For the entire cast, the character customization lets you expand their look and abilities via random cards in purchased packs (with earned in-game currency), and that’s is the constant carrot that's kept me playing Garden Warfare 2. Whether it's new attire like a jiffy pop hat for Kernel Corn, a harmonica for Citron, a Batman-like mask for Super Brainz, or entire character variants that offer neat tweaks to weapons or abilities (like a witch doctor Rose who shoots poison or a Deadbeard variant with a rocket launcher you can detonate in midair), I've found myself playing an extra match here and there to earn enough for a slightly more promising pack. The fact that the 75,000 coins to purchase the priciest packs that guarantee character variants can be earned within two hours of hard-fought battles makes the in-game economy tough but fair.  With almost every standard shooter mode under the sun already a part of the PVZ experience and carried over from the original and its DLC, Plants vs Zombies 2’s truly new features are more about making sure Plants and Zombies can enjoy everything equally. There's now a Plant-focused version of the highly competitive capture-and-defend mode Gardens and Graveyards called Herbal Assault, while the prize flower of Plants vs. Zombies – the wave-based co-op of Garden Ops – can now be played with Zombies under the name Graveyard Ops. Allowing us to use all these diverse classes in every mode is a great improvement.    Just about every mode can be tackled with AI, and in split-screen co-op. While it’s great fun to go online and join in the often-crazy 24-player war between the eponymous factions, just about every single mode can also be tackled with AI partners and enemies, and in split-screen co-op. Even better, you can customize the layouts of each team and apply crazy modifiers like never-empty weapons, double speed, or crazy knockbacks that send you across the map when hit. The AI is pretty good, though it’s not the best at handling Imps - on higher difficulties they usually die long before their mechs are ready.  The go-it-alone experience is best in the wave-based Ops modes, where you can spawn three teammates and hot-swap between them to take on the randomized enemies. Garden Warfare 2 never needles you to switch up characters, but doing so is the best way to learn new ways to fight outside your preferred Plant or Zombie. Aside from that, Garden Warfare 2 has some underwhelming mission-based campaigns for each side. Each mission is a slight tweak on a multiplayer mode, save for the crazy final mission. I don't want to spoil it, but the insanity of the new wave-based combat style is a wonderful capper that I was glad to jump right back into, even if it is a weird thematic shift. While the less-dynamic missions are still a good way to earn some coins and learn the ropes before heading online, I’ve had more of an impetus to keep playing thanks to the constantly changing active quests that offer up bonus XP multipliers and extra currency. Whether it’s taking out a specific enemy type a certain amount of times, notching kills with particular abilities, or just winning in a specific mode, I’ve found myself using the active quests as inspiration to try mix up my playstyle. Under its attractively bright and cartoony art style, Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare 2 has a great amount of modes and customization options to enjoy, whether alone against the AI or with online allies and enemies. The interesting abilities options of the six new character classes gave me something to sink my teeth into, and the customization options are a great reward for playing outside my comfort zone. The sheer amount of enjoyment in this full garden will keep me in the war for some time to come.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	 When IGN first reviewed Rocket League on PlayStation 4 last year, we gave it a score of 8.0 for “Great.” Here’s what we said then: “Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds.”   The best value for first-time buyers who want to go all in on Rocket League and its extra content. Six months after its initial release, developer Psyonix’s, feel-good, easy-to-pick-up, impossible-to-put-down, breakout success has finally arrived on Xbox One. This new port of Rocket League packages the same fast-paced action along with new Xbox-exclusive themed cosmetic items, and three of the previously-released downloadable content packs, making it the best value for first-time buyers who want to go all in on Rocket League and its extra content. The special formula that makes Rocket League so good has made the jump to Microsoft’s console completely intact. Hitting pitch to tumble through the air to make impossibly angled shots, and pull off clutch saves is as exhilarating as ever, and the constant stream of unlockable cosmetics and vehicles – including the Halo and Gears-of-War-themed machines – mean even in a loss I still felt like progress was made.  That being said, Rocket League on Xbox One probably isn’t worth revisiting for veteran players who’ve already spent hours ripping across its neon-coated arenas. It’s the same great gameplay to be sure, without the cross-platform matchmaking that PS4 and PC players enjoy, so it’s hard to call this the definitive version. And though connection instability causes noticeable rubberbanding from time to time, which can really screw up a shot at the worst possible time, the server-side issues are no worse than the original release and usually resolve when jumping into a new match. Rocket League on Xbox One brings the same excitement to a whole new audience. Though it’s missing cross-platform play here, its totally deserved success to-date ensures that matchmaking lobbies are still filled with players. With its already budget price, and bonus DLC content thrown in, there’s never been a better time to pick up Rocket League.
Zachary Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	 Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia is a dichotomous affair from the outset. This side-scrolling stealth game is very clearly an Assassin’s Creed game in more than just name, but it lacks much of what works well in the full-fledged entries in the series and manages to retain much of what doesn’t.  ACC: Russia arrives devoid of any compelling characters, and repeatedly subjects you to tedious trial-and-error missions. There are moments when it truly shines, but those are quickly eclipsed by uneven mechanics, instant fail-states, and bland level design.   The story is less interested in the October Revolution of 1918, and more on our hero Nikolai Orev’s attempts to flee Russia and start a new life outside the order with his family. He falls squarely into  the “grizzled veteran” archetype, and instead of delivering a politically charged story rooted in one of the most interesting historical uprisings, you’re simply charged with seeing him through his last mission and recovering a Piece of Eden before the Templars do, just like in every Assassin’s Creed game before it. Russia wastes no time in introducing you to its numerous ways to fail a mission. Firstly, despite being a Master Assassin, Nikolai has very little health and he’s not worth much in a fight. As a stealth game, combat is supposed to take a back seat to sneaking and hiding, but even when you’re spotted and must engage enemies head on, you’ve only got one chance to get it right. Regardless of whether enemies are swinging swords, pounding him with clubs, or shooting him with rifles from afar, Nikolai can only withstand one or occasionally two hits before you’re staring at the loading screen.  As a Master Assassin, Nikolai has very little health and he’s not worth much in a fight.  This makes taking on multiple enemies exponentially more difficult. You’ll regularly find yourself with your back turned to one enemy while engaging another. To be fair, a dodge mechanic occasionally saved me from a bullet when I least expected it, but it was clumsy, and only worked half of the time. As the game progressed, I found myself worrying less about blocking and dodging, and mostly trying to brute-force my way through combat segments, as attacking seems more reliable than any defensive maneuvers. So don’t get spotted, right? Unfortunately, the stealth segments aren’t particularly wonderful either. Most missions are focused on a sneaking segment and, to be fair, there are sometimes genuinely clever and engaging ones. It’s admittedly impressive just how much of the traditional Assassins’ skill set developer Climax Studios was able to cram into the structure of a 2D platformer. You can hide behind or inside of objects, stash bodies, and distract guards using guns, smoke bombs and and an electrified grappling hook. Each area is laid out almost like a diorama, you can survey the scene around you and plan accordingly to try and reach your objective as efficiently as possible.   And the backdrops are occasionally gorgeous to look at. The war-torn buildings and gilded palaces of Moscow look like something out of a watercolor pop-up book, and the art team should be applauded for their clever use of backdrops that recall the iconic propaganda of the era. When instant-fail states are thrown into the mix, however, these beautiful stealth portions are reduced to trial-and-error style of gameplay that cripples many of ACC: Russia’s best segments. Frequently, there’s no clear indication of how to sneak past certain guards, and I was forced to adopt a method of purposely failing missions in different ways to eliminate things that didn’t work, hoping to stumble across the right path. In the end, each stealth encounter felt like a poorly designed puzzle without clues, and that robbed me of much of the joy and vindication that I would feel finishing a particularly difficult or perplexing segment in most other games.   Both combat and stealth missions are improved upon by the second playable character, the young Duchess Anastasia Romanova. Not unlike Assassin’s Creed Syndicate’s Evie Frye, Anastasia is an instantly more likeable character, and after an encounter with a Piece of Eden, Anastasia learns the ways of the Assassins. Her skill set offers more variety than Nikolai’s, despite having fewer weapons at her disposal. What sets her apart is her Helix abilities. These skills are rooted in Assassin’s Creed lore and allow Anastasia to phase unseen between hiding spots, and to erase the bodies of her foes from time and space. She can move through areas much more fluidly, and late-game missions see you switching between to the two characters to solve puzzles and open doors for each other. These are by far the best missions in ACC: Russia, and are disappointingly few and far between.  Neither character can salvage any joy from the overly difficult, repetitive, and infuriating endless runner segments, though. These missions, while beautiful to look at, represent the worst that ACC: Russia has to offer. They take what could have been a series of exciting platforming challenges and ruin them with poor mechanics and insane difficulty spikes.  Neither character can salvage any joy from the overly difficult, repetitive, and infuriating endless runner segments  What’s frustrating here is the lack of direction in these sequences. You’re usually being pursued by something, like a series of explosions, or a tank that moves faster than your character, so you’re constantly trying to stay one step ahead while leaping and ducking obstacles. Over and over I found myself running to the same spot with no indication of where to go next, only to be run over or blown up and do it all again. The controls also seem to go haywire in these segments. Whether it’s a result of the speed or perspective, it seemed like a jump or hiding spot that worked on the first four attempts led to instant deaths on the fifth and sixth runs, only to inexplicably work flawlessly on the seventh. It repeatedly undermines the pace and rhythm that could have made these segments great. Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: Russia disappoints on multiple levels, from a flat main character to unintuitive insta-fail stealth levels to clumsy combat and platforming. The few times it nails it with diorama-like puzzles and Helix powers only serve to make the rest of this side-scrolling spinoff look even worse by comparison.
Jared Petty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	 As a platformer, Cobalt feels like a good idea that sadly leaves too many rough edges unpolished. The flexible control scheme integrates a well-implemented bullet-time mode that makes flipping and deflecting my way through crowds of enemies a breeze, but poorly designed levels often proved unfit arenas for showcasing my dexterity. Even worse, a game-breaking bug stopped me in my tracks.  Cobalt starts off pleasantly enough, introducing an intuitive combat system that lets you easily manage an arsenal of useful weapons and countermeasures to adjust to different foes and situations. I enjoyed stopping to soak in the soundtrack of catchy, kitschy elevator-music electronica as I guided my maneuverable robotic avatar through the expansive levels. Early encounters do a decent job of teaching the fundamentals of combat and exploration. Hidden caches of loot nearly always rewarded my curiosity. Hidden caches of loot nearly always rewarded my curiosity...  The frustration ramps up quickly. Enemy placement in story mode often seemed either random or malicious, resulting in a number of unpreventable deaths at the hands of arbitrarily timed high-explosives or unseen snipers. Cobalt gives you precision tools and encourages you to flex your muscles and utilize a speedy, bullet time-fueled agility to block incoming projectiles and return fire, but more often than not the reward for boldness was a frustrating, unfair-feeling demise. A Cobalt arcade mode I met my many ends at the hands of grenades that dropped the moment I struck an enemy, foes that leapt from hidden alcoves and gave me no time to react, or heavy objects that sometimes spawned immediately above me, crushing me before I ever knew they were there. High-explosive dynamite sometimes dropped too closely in narrow passageways to allow any reasonable chance of escape. It’s made less painful by quick respawn times, but that doesn’t take away the aggravation of feeling my time’s been wasted by lethal obstacles I couldn’t have seen coming. ...crushing me before I ever knew they were there...  In the moments where I was free to use the wide variety of customizable weapons and defensive maneuvers available to me, Cobalt was a lot of fun. Carefully timed flips allowed me to send projectiles screaming back at foes, and I had a great time searching for the plentiful secrets scattered around the seven story levels. Late in the story campaign, I especially enjoyed acquiring a sort of robot mind-control weapon which allowed me to opt for a more stealthy and systematic approach to enemies. Rather than diving into battle, I sneaked about and hung back, letting my robot minions do the killing for me. Cobalt building But every time Cobalt started to shine, another problem reared its ugly head: the irritating respawn system sometimes resurrected me surrounded by enemies, who took the opportunity to instantly kill me again. It forced me to restart several times in succession and spam the roll-defense button until I happened upon the lucky moment when I could limp away. I also wasn’t a fan of the bland and repetitive boss battles, which were mostly retreads of one another with a compounded difficulty. Every climactic encounter was fundamentally a longer, more difficult version of previous challenges as I scrambled from terminal to terminal, deactivating nodes while fighting waves of rapidly-spawning minions. I’d have liked more variety in these boss fights. Cobalt enemies Unfortunately, I never got to see the end of Cobalt’s Story mode. About 12 hours in, I encountered a game-breaking bug that prevented a key I needed from appearing. I simply couldn’t progress, and no amount of creative resetting could fix my broken save. I encountered a game-breaking bug...  Multiplayer modes are better implemented. The automatic slow-motion physics triggered by approaching projectiles contribute to rewarding deathmatches and team events, and allow the artful combat mechanics to really shine. Eight-player bouts are reminiscent of quality matches in Towerfall or Samurai Gunn, and the bullet-time physics really make it easy to tell exactly where everybody is at any given second, despite the chaos. Additionally, Cobalt's arcade mode includes a collection of enjoyable combat challenges and speed runs. They're competent diversions, and wisely designed to play to Cobalt's greatest strengths: the responsive controls and momentum-based agility. I wasn't blown away by any of these modes, but I had a good time fooling around. There’s a pretty good game buried somewhere inside Cobalt, obscured by layers of poor balancing and technical glitches. The energetic combat and fun weapons make multiplayer a neat pick-up-and-play experience, but the bungled and buggy story mode just doesn’t cut it. Cobalt left me feeling blue.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	 These days I tend to enjoy games that are similar to a good book: a solitary, escapist experience I can get completely lost in without any interruptions from the outside world. Firewatch, then – on the strength of its gripping story, brilliant branching script, wholly convincing voice-acting performances, and stunning art direction – is easily one of my favorite and most memorable game experiences of this decade. Firewatch quickly lets you know that it’s not going to pull any emotional punches over its four to five–hour runtime, opening with a series of text-based choices that call back to adventure genre forebears like Zork. I dare not spoil this potent sequence, but I will say that it masterfully bounces between being funny and heart-wrenching and plausibly establishes just why protagonist Henry ends up in the Wyoming woods as a solitary fire lookout.    Above: Firewatch Day 1 gameplay video (SPOILER WARNING)  The Two Forks Woods sticks in my mind like a real place.  Once you arrive there, Firewatch’s powerful ambiance takes hold. The story takes place over the course of an entire summer, with different “days” – which are treated as chapters of the story – playing out at different hours of the day and night. That allows bold reds, yellows, and oranges to color this fictional Wyoming forest’s beautifully painted scenery (a contribution by renowned illustrator Olly Moss) – all in a comfortable and immersive first-person perspective. It is a testament to both Moss and Firewatch’s level designers that, even despite the stylized look, the Two Forks Woods sticks in my mind like a real place: the narrow passage through Thunder Canyon, the serene calm of Jonesy Lake, the comically small size of Pork Pond, and the unexplained mystery of the Medicine Wheel. In fact, only the strange absence of almost any wildlife whatsoever betrays the convincing setting. Firewatch sounds as good as it looks, thanks to a world-class script acted to perfection by its two leads. Rookie lookout Henry is given a playful vulnerability; you can choose to play him serious or funny, and the performance is up to the task either way. Henry’s boss – and primary point of human contact for the entire summer – is Delilah. Her emotional armor is thick, and she shows the cracks in her personality we’re allowed to see as we play without resorting to being overdramatic.    Above: Firewatch Day 2 gameplay video (SPOILER WARNING)  It’s tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of each other  Right from the jump, their relationship feels real, despite the fact that they’re communicating entirely via radio, with no faces on screen to lend emotional cues. Henry – or Hank, as she sometimes defiantly calls him – comes across as a good man at heart, but a flawed one – a man not sure about whether or not to go back to the life he left behind in Boulder, Colorado. He is fully capable of matching wits with Delilah, who uses humor as a shield for the personal life she doesn’t like discussing as they get to know each other over the course of the summer. It’s a pair of firework-launching teenage girls that set Firewatch’s story in motion, and you can choose to talk to Delilah at almost any time by bringing up your two-way radio. She’s got something to say about almost everything, whether you need advice on how to handle a given situation or you’re just reporting your progress on a task she’s given you, and she’s so engaging that I found myself eager to call about every little thing I came across. Things get darker – in a figurative as well as a sometimes literal sense – when the teens go missing, and you and Delilah try to piece together the puzzle of their whereabouts while making your own critical (sometimes difficult) decisions. The writing here is simply head and shoulders above nearly every other game I’ve ever played. In fact, Firewatch’s script, unlike most video games, would also make a fantastic novella that’s every bit as gripping as the game is. It’s tense, scary, and funny – sometimes all within a few minutes of each other. Not a lot of games can successfully claim that.    Above: 17 minutes of Firewatch gameplay (SPOILER WARNING)  There were points where I was afraid to turn around in the vast, lonely woods.  Like other so-called “walking simulators,” the gameplay in Firewatch is the story, though at least there’s more to actually do here than in most games within the genre. A substantial swath of Two Forks Woods is explorable, with supply caches, unique sights, and even a hidden turtle you can adopt (you’re gonna live with me now, Shelly Duvall!). You’ll rappel down cliffsides, climb up rock formations, explore the lookout tower that doubles as your home for the summer, and more. And yet, these same simple actions that are a delightful exploration of your new surroundings at the beginning of the game become almost terrifying as the plot progresses, leading to points where, playing in Henry’s first-person perspective, I was afraid to turn around in the vast, lonely woods. Speaking of navigation: though I’m thankful there’s no giant arrow at the top of the screen pointing me exactly to where I need to go at any given moment, I did find getting around the Two Forks Woods a bit cumbersome at times, particularly near the end. While I was never hung up for too long, translating the map to the actual trail in front of you had me occasionally taking a wrong fork in the path. Henry’s compass helps a lot, however, so I was never hung up for too long. As for the ending, it’s the only other part of Firewatch I wasn’t crazy about. I want to be very careful not to spoil anything, so I’ll just say that I didn’t quite find the revelation I had hoped for when I reached the end of what the story had been building up to. At the same time, however, I didn’t dislike the ending either. In fact, I find myself still thinking about it, trying to think of missed clues or other small cues that might yet give me the “Ah-ha!” moment I’m after. I’ll be very interested to hear other people’s take on the conclusion – this is the kind of game where the discussions that will arise afterwards are an important extension of the experience itself.   Firewatch is now available for Xbox One, and it brings with it a couple of new features that are also being added into the existing PC and PS4 versions. Developer commentary – accessed as a separate mode – is integrated brilliantly as a series of national park listening stations, complete with period-appropriate cassette tapes. You'll hear from most of the Campo Santo team, and the kiosks are placed liberally enough where there's a lot of fun behind-the-scenes information to be gleaned at all times. I wish more games did this. The other new mode is a free-roam mode that lets you continue to wander the Wyoming wilderness even after completing the storyline. Firewatch is amazing for many reasons, but above all because it’s an adult game that deals with serious issues, with realistic adult dialogue to match. And it deals with those issues just like actual adults would: sometimes with humor, sometimes with anger, and sometimes with sadness. It is among the very best of the first-person narrative genre, and it reminds us what video game storytelling is capable of in the right hands. It’s a game I can see coming back to every year or two just to revisit its beautiful sights and memorable characters – just like a good book.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	 Unravel is perhaps best thought of as a pastoral platformer, where the terrain itself is of greater significance than how Yarny, its immediately loveable hero, moves through through it. While there are some great physics-based puzzles to solve and plenty of fun mechanics to play around with, Unravel distinguishes itself less as a platformer and more by offering an emotionally ambitious and complex adventure set which plays out against a breathtaking and atmospheric landscape.   Every single level of this five- to six-hour adventure looks fantastic. Unravel creates the illusion of exploring each stage from the diminutive perspective of Yarny, our diminutive but charming protagonist. And by restricting the camera’s focus to the immediate foreground, it forces you to pay attention to the small details – tiny rocks, blades of grass, bright red berries, all of which are highly realistic and richly detailed. Playing Unravel feels like you’re looking at the world through a magnifying glass, and it’s wonderful to explore. Whether he’s gaping at the beauty of the world around him or quietly shivering during a thunderstorm, Yarny’s adorable and relatable. While he has no facial features apart from two eyes, and his body is made up entirely of convincingly textured wool, he’s animated with such skill that he’s able to convey more of his inner joy and pain than many fully human characters. But Yarny’s more than just expressive and cute – as a child’s homemade toy come to life, he’s the means by which I was able to return to a more innocent state of wonder, and more fully appreciate the natural world he explores. It all sounds rather grand, maybe a bit pretentious, yet in practice it’s a subtle and quietly effective device. So much of what I love about Unravel is related to the emotional journey it took me on, but there’s also a strong gameplay experience to be found. Unravel features some fantastic environmental puzzles, which really come to life through Yarny’s wide range of special abilities.   Like many whip-wielding platforming heroes, he can swing across gaps, but being entirely made from wool, he can also rappel down walls, lasso distant objects, anchor platforms in place, tether objects to himself and each other, not to mention create high-wires, pulleys, and trampolines. While there are a few creatures capable of hurting Yarny, such as crabs and cockroaches, he possesses no combat moves, remaining a passive little guy throughout and maintaining his cuddly personality. To survive these situations, instead, he must hide or craftily find alternate routes around such dangers. The sheer variety of Yarny’s skillset ensures that every solution is enjoyable to enact, even if they’re not perhaps the most challenging to figure out. The best puzzles come when the camera zooms out, and you must assess a much larger puzzle with multiple stages. These are much more difficult since Yarny is composed of a limited amount of wool, so if you perform unnecessary actions there’s a real danger of him unravelling before the puzzle is solved – if this happens, you must retrace Yarny’s steps and devise a more straightforward, less yarn-intensive solution. Sadly this mechanic isn’t used nearly often enough, despite its obvious potential for more challenging puzzles.   Relative to the strong puzzles, the pure platforming sections are more mixed in quality. In contrast to Unravel’s huggable appearance, there are sections where it’s almost impossible to avoid dying on your first attempt, no matter how sharp your reactions. I’m totally fine when this is related to puzzles that must be solved in order for Yarny to survive, but it sometimes feels like pure trial and error. For instance, in one particular section, you must scale a steep hill while avoiding falling rocks – a pretty standard platforming scenario, but here there aren’t enough tells for where the next rock was going to land that I felt I had a chance to avoid it without memorizing the pattern. I eventually reached the top, but it wasn’t at all satisfying; I felt like I got there through perseverance, not platforming ability. It’s a shame, as the idea of challenge is well incorporated thematically. Unravel’s idyllic opening locations soon give way to much darker, sinister settings, where nature is overrun by litter, toxic chemicals, and heaps of rusted machinery. Even the scummier aspects of Unravel’s world look great – the garbage is detailed and textured, while the toxic waste possesses an eerie blue glow and violently fizzes should Yarny fall in. Within these darker sections, Yarny encounters fast-moving hazards, such as erratic piston-heads and gauntlets of vicious cogs. By upping the challenge, Unravel articulately conveys the menace of industrialisation, but the message comes at a cost: they’re some of the least enjoyable sections to play. Yarny’s movement speed isn’t well suited for this type of death trap, and sometimes he slips off platforms a bit too easily, or takes a touch too long to gather his own thread and climb to safety. This isn’t the intricate, precise platforming experience you’d find in Super Meat Boy or a good Super Mario Maker level.   Initially Unravels appears to be an uplifting experience, but also there’s a real sadness to be uncovered. This melancholia springs from the way it plays with memory and explores our relationship to the past. To underscore this, Yarny accesses each level through a series of photographs displayed in a family home, where he becomes the literal thread which connects the present to the past, memories good and bad. Unravel leans heavily into this metaphor, and for the most part it works. Occasionally, during a stage, you’ll see a fuzzy apparition of Yarny’s family in the past. But by returning to these places, Yarny dispels the haziness of memory; with him present, everything is suddenly clear and connected. Unravel took me on a surprisingly thoughtful and reflective journey, which encouraged me to appreciate the small and the insignificant with every step. As a puzzler it has charm due to Yarny’s engaging skills, but as a platforming experience it’s less remarkable. But to judge it solely on these mechanical aspects would be to overlook its greater achievement: the way it provokes subtle and complex emotions through the use of nature and nostalgia. It all makes for a sincere, warm-hearted, and extremely likeable adventure.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	 Update: XCOM 2 has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  There’s an air of white-knuckle desperation about XCOM 2’s post-apocalyptic setting, and it only enhances the tension. Taking place 20 years after humanity shockingly lost the war we played in 2012’s excellent XCOM: Enemy Unknown, we’re now fighting to overthrow a decades-long alien occupation of the planet. It’s a very thematically appropriate scenario for a game about taking four to six-person squads into battle against initially-superior alien forces, and a great backdrop for these unpredictable, tactically deep, and addictive battles.   Above: Watch some XCOM 2 gameplay. Just like before, XCOM’s high-stakes turn-based tactical combat dares you to become attached to your customizable characters (I made most of IGN’s staff in the character editor) knowing that on any given mission they could be permanently killed off because of mistakes or just bad luck. As with Risk, Monopoly, Warhammer, poker, and anything else involving chance, XCOM 2 is a game where you can theoretically do everything right and still lose to bad rolls of the dice, but on the whole a good player will generally come out on top. Deciding when and how to upgrade and use each soldier’s abilities, then crossing your fingers and hoping they’ll make their clutch shot, creates non-stop suspenseful, triumphant, and tragic moments.  You need to have a backup plan, or else you can’t complain when you’re dead. Think of it this way: Playing Russian Roulette with a six shooter with one bullet, your odds of survival are five out of six, or 83.3%. Those are pretty good... but you’d have to be crazy to put your life on the line with a 16.6% chance of blowing your brains out, because way more often than you’d like, you will. But XCOM 2 asks you to make that same gamble – or often much worse – with the lives of your soldiers on virtually every turn. You might think an 80% shot is guaranteed to hit… but in the one time in five that it doesn’t connect, you need to have a backup plan for what happens, or else you can’t complain when you’re dead.    Above: See an XCOM 2 Retaliation mission. Not being dead on your first game is one thing – you almost certainly will die as a result of walking into countless unknown traps, especially if you play above the normal difficulty (as I mostly did – normal, or “veteran,” is a cakewalk for anyone who knows XCOM). But one of XCOM 2’s biggest strengths how it resists your efforts to fall into repetitious patterns. By comparison: after the first real-world month or two of XCOM: Enemy Unknown, it became apparent that anyone who intended to play it for that length of time would have a base build order down to a science, know exactly what to research when, and memorize the best routes through the pre-built maps and have an idea of where enemies would appear on them. XCOM 2 defeats most of those assumptions by introducing randomness throughout its campaign, so that you can’t count on the route that took you to victory one time to deliver you to the same results the next.  You can’t count on anything, but you will get something. Likewise, every time through the 20 to 30-hour campaign you’ll see a random assortment of weapon modifications, soldier stat boosts, special ammo and grenade types, psionic powers, bonuses for covering continents with your resistance network, and more. Will you get incendiary grenades, which are great for disabling enemy special abilities and inflicting damage over time? Or poison rounds, which impair accuracy while also dealing steady damage? Or trace rounds, which increase accuracy on top of their other upgrades? You can’t count on anything, but you will get something, and having to adapt to make use of what’s available is a constant challenge. The same goes for the high-quality procedurally generated maps, and a good variety of mission types. Without knowing ahead of time where an objective will be or the location of the enemy, you’ll attack and defend, extract or kill VIPs, and blow things up. Some missions have turn timers that force you to make risky moves, or to make a hasty retreat. I can’t say I ever had a mission where I lost because the map wasn’t fairly laid out (though I definitely had some tough-to-cross stretches thanks to my use of explosives).  Above: Watch an XCOM 2 trailer. And because you start most missions in concealment, keeping your squad hidden while you set up a lethal ambush is a new and different kind of challenge with a potentially big and cinematic payoff. Concealment is an interesting concept, in that it’s basically XCOM 2’s aliens telling us, “Go ahead: take your best shot.” It’s a simple system at heart: when you start a mission, the enemy doesn’t know you’re there until you get within a certain radius, or you open fire. And usually it is simple, unless you dash ahead without looking (as I’ll admit, I sometimes did). If you exercise caution, though, you can set all but one of your squad into Overwatch mode around a group of enemies, then hit your highest-priority target and watch as your squad (hopefully) dissects the enemy in a beautiful slow-motion slaughter that suffers none of the typical Overwatch penalties.  If the Shieldbearer isn’t disabled, he’ll give every ally around him an energy barrier. Enemies seem geared to compensate for the concealment advantage, though, in that several feature powers that make them much more difficult to kill if they aren’t taken out on the first turn. The Advent Shieldbearer is the best example of this: if he survives and isn’t disabled, he’ll activate a power that gives him and every ally around him an energy barrier that’ll absorb some significant damage. You definitely have to be careful about who you shoot first, because it makes a big difference who’s alive when they start fighting back.  Above: We play two missions with Firaxis. Plus, when you take out two of the three aliens in a group, the last one is sometimes smart enough to retreat and group up with another nearby group. That’s fantastic, because not only is the AI displaying a rare will to survive, it gives you another thing to think about when engaging: leave no survivors, or the next fight might be harder.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	 Rise of the Tomb Raider’s first piece of story-driven DLC Baba Yaga: The Temple of the Witch is an enjoyable, if brief, adventure that adds a welcome supernatural element to familiar puzzle-solving and adventuring. Although a fetch quest in well-trodden territory is a low point, The Temple of the Witch stands out from the main campaign by virtue of this unexpected psychedelia. Lara’s hunt for a witch who’d allegedly terrorized locals for years is a welcome change from Rise of the Tomb Raider’s more grounded threats. In one sequence, Lara must follow her father through a haunted forest, pursued by demonic dogs and leery skeletons. While genuinely spooky, it also serves to illustrate Lara’s complex relationship with her dad, one of the most interesting themes in Rise of the Tomb Raider’s main campaign.  This sense of escalating insanity culminates in a great boss battle that takes place entirely on this otherworldly plane. Multi-tiered and increasingly frantic, this battle is a fitting end to The Temple of the Witch, and offers a satisfying resolution to its mysteries. Outside of its dark wrapper, though, it’s business as usual here. Lara solves puzzles, fetches things, and shoots bad guys. Overall, this isn’t a bad thing - in fact, one of its puzzles is the most enjoyably tricky I’ve yet encountered in this resurrected series - but all that time spent gathering resources in Rise of the Tomb Raider’s overly familiar Soviet Installation felt like a wasted opportunity. After all, The Temple of the Witch's Wicked Vale is an entirely new region, so it’s difficult to comprehend the justification behind returning to such well-worn territory when I could’ve been there instead.  Once your main mission is over – which took me around 2 hours – there are a handful of distractions in The Temple of the Witch to make your return to Rise of the Tomb Raider more worthwhile. A new ‘Dreamstinger’ bow enables you to equip poison arrows that cause hallucinations, and document and survival cache challenges are there for completionists. I was left yearning, however, for new challenge tombs - the absence of one made the post-boss-battle Wicked Vale feel curiously empty.  Baba Yaga: The Temple of the Witch is a brief, but mostly entertaining chapter in Rise of the Tomb Raider’s lore. While I would have happily swapped the return to the Soviet Installation for a new challenge tomb, its supernatural elements added a noticeably different feel and a welcome sense of tension to Lara’s new adventure.
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	 Update: The Witness has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  The Witness is a game brimming with secrets: daunting and multilayered mysteries that sunk into my subconscious, tracing snaking paths across my brain until I was literally seeing mazes every time I closed my eyes. That’s the kind of power The Witness has. It hooked me in with its masterful puzzle design and gorgeous visuals, then compelled me forward as I began to carve out my own purpose on the island. It’s a freedom granted by a world as welcomingly open to exploration as it is enjoyably challenging to solve.   The Witness is a fully 3D world navigated in first person, but revolves around solving two-dimensional mazes found on in-game panels, completed by drawing the correct path from a circular start point to a rounded end point. This simple, intuitive core concept burns at the center of the 700 or so puzzles you’ll find on The Witness’s enigmatic island setting. Tracing lines feels as smooth as cutting butter with both a mouse and a gamepad and is accompanied by a warm, electric buzzing effect. The pure tactile joy of communicating with these interfaces and the initial sense of wonder and mystery their very presence brings were enough to motivate me in the earliest moments of The Witness. But these light-up labyrinths quickly became more sophisticated, adding new rules and constraints to the basic maze-like structure and thus allowing for the real tough, yet fulfilling challenges to emerge.    Puzzles in The Witness are hard, but fair. As I learned to apply each new rule, curiosity soon gave way to obsessive levels of motivation and purpose. I wasn’t just solving puzzles because they were fun – slowly but surely, they were beginning to make sense in a much larger context. This manifests most tangibly in The Witness’s first obvious, overarching “goal” – shooting beams of light into a mountain. The mountain serves as the island’s highest point, most prominent landmark, and consequently its most central mystery for reasons that are obvious once you start playing, but which I won’t spoil here. Most of the major regions on the island house machinery capable of shooting light into the mountain, but can only be activated once you solve the right sequence of puzzles, bestowing my frantic line-drawing antics with an important sense of progress. It also helped me see the various regions of the island as distinct parts of a larger, cohesive whole, making the constant treks across the surprisingly large, dense land mass less daunting because of it. It let me set my own goals, trace my own path around the island, so I never had to feel lost, physically or in terms of my role on the island. A map of the island. There was also enough to do and see beyond the key objectives that my time spent simply wandering still felt compelling minute to minute. I could take a peaceful boat ride around the perimeter, explore the ruins of a wrecked ship, finally make the descent into that hidden underground passage I’d discovered on a previous errand. I valued these quiet moments on the island as much as I did overcoming its most perplexing puzzles, especially during the times I felt truly stuck.   Puzzles in The Witness are hard, but they’re always fair and solvable. In a manner more freeing than most puzzle adventures, you’re allowed and even encouraged to walk away from a problem you don’t feel equipped to solve. That’s a concept introduced in the opening minutes, when you encounter a locked door covered in symbols you’re unfamiliar with. The answers you need are further up the path, but you have to let yourself walk away first to know that. The Witness does more than equip you with the tools needed to find the right answers – it teaches you how to ask the right questions.   Expand this dynamic to the whole of the island, and you get an intelligently designed puzzle game that doesn’t just give you the freedom to chip away at its riddles at your own pace, but creates a compelling adventure of the learning process itself.  I always found seeking the answer just as satisfying as applying it. The masterful design of The Witness’s puzzles is matched by the beautiful and clever layout of the island itself. One early sequence of puzzles unlocks a small courtyard full of sketches and diagrams of human hearts and veins. It didn’t seem of immediate significance when I found it, until I walked out to the neighboring cliffside I had passed by on my way there and noticed the way the red tree roots growing along the edges of the seaside bluff looked like bright, thick arteries coursing through the flesh of the earth. These startling and sometimes enlightening visual revelations were everywhere, adding excitement and meaning to the world even when I wasn’t actively seeking it out. Sights become symbolic with the right context. Every tree, every rock, feels like it has been placed with a purpose, allowing familiar sights to take on thematic weight when viewed from different angles. Ordinary landmarks became focal points when framed with precise deliberation between a grove of trees, or perfectly centered inside a hollow window frame. That’s kind of what The Witness is about: pointing you toward new ways of seeing. Many times, finding the answer meant stepping away from the actual puzzle and asking myself what I wasn’t seeing. Puzzles in The Witness are solved on these panels, but it doesn't mean everything you need to solve them exists within their physical confines. No matter what question a particular puzzle posed, I always found seeking the answer just as satisfying as applying it.   A lot of games try to be about things, but The Witness actually embodies those things. Audio logs hidden around the island contain quotes from famous philosophers and scientists, chosen with obvious care for the way each speaks to specific concepts The Witness sets out to explore. The graceful design of the island had already managed to provoke natural epiphanies about ideas some of the quotes address, so at times the logs felt unnecessary. But then other times the words spoke to me, in the same way the physical island had: an invitation to see things from a new point of view that maybe I hadn’t considered. The view from the top.  Some of the most mind-blowing revelations were hidden in plain sight... One particular quote at the top of the mountain comes from former astronaut Russell Schweickart. As I looked down at the island from its highest point, I felt a connection between what Schweickart was describing, when he spoke about the transformative effect of looking down at the Earth from space, and the all-encompassing view of the island the mountain afforded me. Like the Earth that Schweickart describes, spinning around the same way every day, revealing the same places with each rotation, nothing about the island ever really changes. I could walk by the same thing in The Witness ninety-nine times and never have a second thought, but then on the 100th passing, I'd notice something new about it. But not because the thing itself had changed – because I had. Like everything else in The Witness, finding more concrete answers about this abandoned island and the people who once occupied it requires patience. There’s plenty there to dissect – statues that seem like people frozen from various eras, mysterious corporate logos, hidden audio logs – and it was all enough to keep me enthralled in the mysteries it built across my 40- to 50-hour playthrough. Most of the time it’s more questions than answers, and I enjoyed that it left things open to interpretation. Statues around the island seem like people from all eras, frozen in time. There’s also a lot you can miss – secrets tucked away behind the island’s most challenging obstacles – but some of the most mind-blowing revelations were hidden in plain sight, making every return to the island a new adventure. I estimate it would take 80 to 100 hours to fully do and see everything here, but there’s a satisfying amount of thematic weight and contextual clues that I was able to reach the ending the first time without feeling like The Witness owed me a greater answer to its riddles. Story doesn’t drive The Witness as much as its mystery, nor does it treat story as an arbitrary reward for your efforts; what’s there only enriches an already fulfilling experience. The Witness has a power and pull that carried me throughout the more than 40 hours it took to complete it for the first time, and that, even now, beckons me back to confront the mysteries I left unsolved. Its graceful combination of tangible goals, obscurity, and freedom creates ample opportunity for small victories and grand revelations alike. For the most part, its themes weave themselves beautifully throughout the gorgeous world and wide variety of puzzles, but even when it breaks subtlety in favor of a more heavy-handed approach to exposition, it never detracts from the truly fulfilling moments The Witness offers in terms of solving its physical puzzles and unlocking its deepest mysteries.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	" As I explore the atmospheric hallways of Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster, I’m conflicted. I’ve always enjoyed the games from the early years of this series -- the original take on survival horror made clever use of fixed camera angles, limited resources, and stiff controls to create a distinct style of fear. And this HD update looks and plays like a modern game, and so is certainly the best way to experience this particular game. However, the superficial improvements that successfully update this old school Resident Evil game’s look and feel can’t cover up its deeper underlying problems: predictable pacing, weak story, and forgettable enemies. None of what was wrong with the original is fixed in this version. I’ll give it this much: Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster looks good, thanks to improved lighting and updated textures that bring character models and environments up to modern standards. I noticed only occasional framerate hiccups on the Xbox One version. PC players get a better visual experience, with support for higher resolutions and an option for smoother 60 frames-per-second animations.   Regardless of which platform you choose to experience this HD Remaster, it does a great job of preserving Resident Evil’s old-school pre-rendered backgrounds. It surprises me just how well they hold up. You can see wine bottles gently rolling back and forth on a moving train, or glimpse your character’s reflection in hallway mirrors. Little touches like these contribute greatly to the dark, desolate environments and create an evocative atmosphere that sticks with you.  Little touches... create an evocative atmosphere that sticks with you  In a touch that serves both the purist and newcomer audience, this version can bounce between the original 4:3 aspect ratio and a 16:9 view that zooms in and crops off the top and bottom of the image. The closer camera lets you get a better look at the characters and environments, which I found hard to go back from when I switched, but there’s a catch: it can sometimes obscure important items easily seen in 4:3 mode. The camera will slowly pan up or down to highlight them, but by that time I’d sometimes already moved on thinking there was nothing of note in the room. Additionally, while purists can keep the original tank-style controls, the default mode is an updated scheme that makes moving and bouncing between the two characters in the campaign easy and approachable.   On the other hand, the blurry, upscaled cutscenes didn’t get the same treatment. These CG-rendered story sequences look dated (because they are) and don’t even come close to fidelity of the refreshed in-game character models. It’s a shame Capcom made no effort to redo them. Another thing that wasn’t improved that should’ve been is Resident Evil Zero’s constant inventory juggling act, which remains every bit as tedious as it was in 2002. While it’s true that the series has always used limited resources and carrying capacity to create tension and tough decisions, this chapter overburdens you with too much of inventory management. Rebecca and Billy can hold very few items, with larger weapons that take away up to two of a potential six precious slots of inventory space. The inventory overload is a bummer, since both characters have interesting characteristics -- Rebecca can mix together herbs and create helpful recovery items while Billy can push around heavy objects and take more damage. You have to keep their differences in mind when you solve puzzles or fight off monsters.   The improved presentation and controls feel fruitless since Resident Evil Zero is a such a by-the-numbers story. The six to eight-hour campaign wastes a bunch of time explaining things, in an attempt to build up some context around the first Resident Evil, but ends up with a lots of unsurprising reveals. Resident Evil was never the paragon of voice acting and story, but the series still sustained itself with entertaining campaigns and fun characters. Zero’s awful story borders on self-parody and, as a long-time fan of the series, feels almost as disappointing as a Star Wars prequel.  ""...mutant creatures and bosses appear exactly where and when you’re led to expect them to""  Predictability also plays a major role in Resident Evil Zero’s story woes. For instance, mutant creatures and bosses appear exactly where and when you’re led to expect them to, and if you listen close enough, you can almost hear the bottom of the zombie monster barrel getting scraped clean when unremarkable monsters like Plague Crawler -- a mutated insect that looks like a lame cross between a mantis and grasshopper -- or the Eliminator -- a silly mutated primate -- show up. The Marcus Mimicry, a horrid leech monster that pops up in various spots throughout the story, is the one scary thing here, and it’s squandered by the campaign.   The only bit of new content added to this remaster is an unlockable mode that lets you replay the same poor story as recurring villain Albert Wesker. Though using his enhanced super-abilities was more fun than the first time around, it feels like an awkward apology for the rest of Resident Evil Zero’s bland and forgettable attempt at survival horror. Outside of nostalgia, there’s not much reason to revisit it. Resident Evil Zero HD Remaster has the look and feel of a modern game, but its real problems started in 2002 and were never solved. It’s a forgettable entry in an outstanding series that just doesn’t measure up because of its story problems, overwhelming inventory management, and horrible predictability. Reanimating this limp corpse of a survival game in high definition only brings back the disappointment I felt when I played it the first time."
Justin Davis	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	 A Block and a Hard Place, Episode 4 of Minecraft: Story Mode, is another middling chapter in Telltale’s kid-friendly Minecraft tale. Its attention to Minecraft detail and satisfying, action-packed climax keep it from being a complete bust, but these highs aren’t enough to overcome the rest of the episode’s predictable plot twists, inconsequential story, and often uninteresting dialogue. This dichotomy is encapsulated in Episode 4’s first major event: a quest in which Jesse and his posse have to travel to the “Far Lands” to retrieve a MacGuffin that will hopefully allow them to defeat the Wither Storm and save the world. The Far Lands are a real Minecraft concept - if you can manage to reach the edge of the (nearly) infinite map, Minecraft can glitch out and strange things can be seen. It’s a cute and clever to see this fabled place discussed and eventually explored by a group of people that actually live in this world. And as usual, the set itself is massive and detailed.   Unfortunately, this is an example of real dialogue experienced while making the long and arduous journey: “Is it much further?” “Not too much further.” Riveting stuff, I know.  The dialogue commonly succumbs to cliche. In addition to often feeling flat and uninteresting, the dialogue commonly succumbs to cliche. “How long have you been standing there?” One character is asked when walking in on the second half of an incriminating conversation. “Long enough,” is (of course) the reply. A Block and a Hard Place continues Story Mode’s emphasis on the past, to mixed results. Its explorations of themes like the dangers of hero worship and how ego or hubris can ruin friendships is well done, and a welcome bit of thoughtfulness in an otherwise fairly light story. But in practical terms, this means Story Mode spends a whole lot of time focusing on characters and conflicts that aren’t directly related to Jesse, instead focusing on the legendary heroes The Order of the Stone. This puts us in the back seat, often taking a passive role in the drama. Thankfully, the final showdown manages to satisfy on multiple levels. The victory for Jesse and company feels well earned - they come up with a plan, and execute on it via fun, and occasionally actually challenging, QTE button-prompts. By the end, it genuinely feels like this group of heroes really is a group of heroes, even though they started Episode 1 as a bunch of goofballs. The entire sequence is also well-directed and acted. It’s a satisfying end to Story Mode’s overarching threat.   Unfortunately the iffy storytelling returns to the forefront as the episode draws to a close. Multiple story threads that have spanned the entire series are wrapped up off-screen thanks to a small time jump. Amnesia? Gone. A friend’s life-threatening illness Jesse kept promising he would fix? It fixes itself. This neat wrap-up is especially disappointing because, like Story Mode’s other episodes, the adventure is fairly short at around an hour and 45 minutes. As for what’s next… well that’s the big question, isn’t it? We know a fifth episode is coming, but A Block and a Hard Place ends the current story arc. We’ll have to wait and see what this means for our motley crew, and for Story Mode’s potential long-term future. Telltale’s love and deep understanding of Minecraft combined with a thrilling satisfying climax keep Minecraft: Story Mode Episode 4 - A Block and a Hard Place  from reaching a new series low at the hands of poor dialogue and a meandering plot. It’s still a little too slow-paced and predictable to recommend wholeheartedly.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	 Right from the surprisingly colorful opening storyboards, Assassin's Creed Chronicles: India promises to be different than last year’s China chapter – and it is, but not always in the right ways. Graphically, it has more soul than its visually limp predecessor, but ACC: India stumbles terribly in places that game doesn't. As a stealth game, its reliance on cheap gotcha tactics and flimsy instant-fail mission objectives feels like a step backwards for a spinoff series that seemed to be headed in the right direction, at least gameplay-wise.  It's too bad, because things start out fairly promising. Arbaaz, the star of the show, has as much of Disney’s Aladdin in him as he does Ezio, and his voice actor does a decent enough job of laying on the charm, despite the less-than-impressive script he's reading off of. The story never turns into anything more than following bad people to wherever they plan to do bad things and stopping them, but it least it doesn't get in the way.   What does get in the way however, is ACC: India’s heavy reliance on instant fail-states as a form of challenge. You know those tailing missions that nobody likes in the main-line Assassin's Creed games? There are a few here, mixed in with their equally hated cousin, the “instantly fail if you are seen or heard even once” mission. At first I wrote these off as exceptions in the level design, which began as generally respectable. But as I progressed, they began feeling more like the rule; discouraging me from experimenting in favor of just scrambling to do whatever was quickest or most optimal in order to avoid failure.  I wouldn’t be lamenting this lack of freedom nearly as much if it weren’t for the fact that, at face value, the stealth toolset in ACC: India has a lot of potential. You can move and hide bodies, pick locks, use the environment to distract or outright kill enemy guards, and a whole lot of other neat tricks too. It’s nothing you’ve never seen in a stealth game, but it’s surprising how much of it works within the framework of a 2D platformer. It’s just frustrating to be handed this fairly robust set of stealth tools and then be essentially forced to engage with them in only the most stifling, expedient of ways. Fair or not, this kind of challenge undermines any sense of rhythm Chronicles tries to build.  Things only get more maddening around halfway through the brief five-hour campaign, when new obstacles and enemies capable of instantly killing you show up in force. I don't generally mind this particular kind of challenge when it's conveyed clearly, but here, it rarely is. The various light traps found in the striking-looking Precursor levels do a good job of clearly signaling the threat they pose, but others do not, sometimes by design. Explosive tripwires sometimes blend right in with the background, bringing a well-executed stealth sequence to a grinding halt. New assassin enemies hide in shadows, killing you instantly as you run by unless you happen to be walking around with Eagle Vision on to suss them out and deal with them before advancing. None of it is actually difficult to deal with once you know it’s there, it just feels like a cheap and aggravating way to artificially extend the length of the campaign.  Fair or not, this kind of challenge undermines any sense of rhythm Chronicles tries to build. It’s a problem that’s especially apparent in the fast-paced escape-style levels, which are, rather ironically, some of the best parts of ACC: India. They put the fluid traversal controls front and center, while also serving up the kind of beautiful vistas that ACC: China sorely lacks. Flourishes of much-needed color punctuate the layered, picturesque settings this time around. And yet the joy of racing through them while narrowly escaping mortar fire and rampaging elephants is far too regularly interrupted by what seems like the equivalent of a supposed master Assassin slipping on a banana peel and breaking his neck. In terms of presentation, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India remedies the stiff sense of joylessness that pervades Chronicles: China by injecting more color and personality wherever it seemed possible. That renewed energy only makes it more disappointing that the generally well-designed missions have given way to the artifice of cheap-feeling instant deaths. While the gameplay foundation here is still competent, Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: India just finds too many petty, annoying ways to keep me from truly enjoying it.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	 Just Cause 3 is a game about pulling insane, death-defying stunts while destroying everything in sight with spectacular fireball explosions. The problem is, both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions fail when Rico Rodriguez's over-the-top action-heroism needs them the most.   Above: Problems with the console versions are widespread. For a more in-depth look at all the things Just Cause 3 does right when it's running well, please check out my Just Cause 3 PC review. Unfortunately, the console versions simply don't give it a chance to shine. When the spectacular fireworks and hilarious, delightfully destructive chaos kick off, the frame rate often drops well below 30 frames per second. And when the frame rate drops, it’s much harder to defy death as you’re piloting one of the many helicopters, jets, or cars, or stay in the air when you’re using the fun but touchy wingsuit. When you die, you’re subjected to loading times that can last 90 seconds or more.  I found myself afraid of another stint in that load-screen penalty box After a few hours of that, I found myself afraid of another stint in that load-screen penalty box. I began playing conservatively, avoiding crazy stunts that require precise timing or triggering massive explosions in the heat of battle. And when you’re playing conservatively, Just Cause 3 gets boring and frustrating quickly. The task of liberating dozens of towns and capturing military bases by blowing up anything with red on it, knocking over statues, and taking over fortified police stations is pretty repetitive even when it’s at its best, and if you’re not able to exercise your creativity in this sandbox by doing crazy moves, like using your grapple to fling explosive barrels at enemies or crash helicopters into things to keep it interesting, it’s a pretty dull third-person shooter. Enemies this dumb aren’t much fun to fight in conventional ways.  Watch our Xbox One vs PlayStation 4 vs PC graphics comparison above. Likewise, the strength of its enormous open world is undermined by start-up loading times that can brush up against four minutes. And when it crashes on you every so often, you get to repeat that. And the beautiful vistas don’t look as beautiful when they’re smeared by low-frame rate motion blur. The problems seem a bit worse on the Xbox One than the PlayStation 4, but they’re both pretty bad. At its best, Just Cause 3's over-the-top action and physics-based mayhem has me laughing out loud on the regular. It’s a damn shame so many performance problems and punishing load times keep cropping up, because I love what Just Cause 3 does. But for game that’s so heavily dependent on action to run this poorly is no laughing matter.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	 Rainbow Six Siege pulls me in opposite directions at the same time. On the one hand, the moment-to-moment gameplay experience is fantastic. Every second of the short rounds matter, walls and floors won’t protect you, and sound tactics win matches. But, like other 2015 multiplayer-focused shooters such as Evolve and Star Wars Battlefront, there’s not a lot of there there. My time with Siege leaves me feeling like this Rainbow Six revival is a skeleton with not a lot of meat on its bones.   Siege reboots the long-running Rainbow Six series as a five-on-five, attack-and-defend competitive shooter that’s as much about blowing holes in the world around you as in your opponents. Destruction is no gimmick; shooting through walls, blasting through floors and ceilings, and keeping as much of your corporeal Special Forces husk behind fragile cover during firefights is key to extending your life in each of the respawn-free modes. Using a gadget to detect the presence of an enemy and fragging them through what would, in most other first-person shooters, be an indestructible hunk of drywall isn’t just satisfying; it’s thrilling. And while Siege isn’t the best-looking shooter out there in terms of environmental detail or character models, it includes memorable touches like the arterial blood spray that coats the wall behind your target when you off them. It looks like something truly terrible happened in that spot.  Playing defense (in applicable game modes) is a strategic rush because you know the attackers could burst through a wall at any moment. When defending an objective, you’ll have 30 seconds or so at the start of a round to fortify key areas with barbed wire on the floor, barricades, reinforced doors and windows, and more, to limit the enemy’s ability to approach their target from certain angles. I haven’t liked fortification in a shooter this much since Gears of War 3’s Horde mode. Rainbow Six’s audio deserves special mention here, too, because the only soundtrack to each map is the sounds each player makes. Sure, there’s the obvious stuff like gunshots, but it’s the little noises like the suction of a breach charge being placed on a wall or floor, or the metallic rustle of an enemy wading through a barbed wire trap that, if you listen closely, can clue you in on what the other guys are about to do. Then, when things get loud, delightful chaos ensues.  That offense-vs.-defense is reflected in Siege’s Operators – 20 characters (10 attackers and 10 defenders) each team can choose from, each with unique skills. I’m rather partial to Sledge, who can instantly pound holes through walls and floors; Thermite, who can laser-cut his way through reinforced doors or windows; and Pulse, who can detect nearby heartbeats through any surface (though defender Mute can block any nearby gadget as a counter). On the other side of that spectrum, I couldn’t find a use for the Stimpack gun-toting Doc, as very few firefights ended with wounded teammates – guns tend to be so lethal you’re either alive or dead, with nothing in between.   I’m also happy with most of the 11 included maps. Bank is an early favorite, as there’s a basic cops-and-robbers fantasy fulfillment in trying to rescue a hostage from a bank vault while the other team is leveling walls to try and get to you.  While the maps have enough variety between them, the adversarial game modes feel very similar. Hostage, Bomb, and Secure Area are all variations of, “Try to get into a place the other team is keeping you out of.” The CTF-like Hostage carries the most potential, since it ostensibly has the added goal of grabbing a human-shaped flag and carrying it out of danger, but in my experience no one ever even got to the hostage, let alone rescued him/her. Instead, an overwhelming majority of rounds ended with one team getting wiped out. As for the returning Horde-like Rainbow Six favorite, Terrorist Hunt, where you and your team hold out against waves of AI enemies? Normal mode is a bit of a misnomer. On that skill, the CPU-controlled creeps have fairly lousy aim and won’t take advantage of many of Siege’s new mechanics outside of shooting through walls. Crank it up to at least Hard and you’ll have a better, more realistic, human-simulating challenge with your friends.  Finally, there are Situations: 10 single-player training missions (on the same 10 maps) that spotlight half of the 20 included Operators. They serve as decent tutorials for multiplayer proper, but because you don’t have AI teammates at your side, they teach you little about the tactics and choices you’ll have at your disposal when other people get involved. After that, the bonus Situation 11 that unlocks after you complete the other 10 actually backfires as a pleasant surprise. Not because it’s bad – quite the opposite! It’s a five-player bespoke Terrorist Hunt scenario, complete with an intro cutscene, a unique gameplay hook I won’t spoil, and a post-mission cutscene that basically announces, “Rainbow Six is back! And we’ll totally hook you up with a proper co-op campaign next time, promise!” It’s effectively the developers saying, “Here’s everything you wanted in a narrative-driven campaign that we totally could’ve given you!” It’s a tease.   The least interesting part of Rainbow Six Siege is its progression system. Literally everything is locked when you first fire up the game, including ranked multiplayer matches, which don’t become available until you reach character level 20 – easily 10+ hours. Siege more or less forces you to play the Situations in order to earn Renown, the currency used to unlock the 20 Operators and their weapon attachments. Completing all 10 and achieving 90% of the secondary objectives along the way allowed me to unlock half of the Operator roster. After that, however, it’s a slow grind, as the second 10 require much more Renown to unlock, and completing Terrorist Hunt or PvP matches doesn’t earn you much. Especially if you lose. And that doesn’t even take into account the additional Renown you’ll need in order to unlock vital attachments like scopes and recoil suppressors. It’s almost as if the game wants you to spend real-world cash on Renown point bundles in order to speed up the process. Despite the barbed wire and reinforced walls that Rainbow Six Siege makes you walk through in order to get to the meat of the gameplay, I can’t stop thinking about how much fun that gameplay is. I’ve already made new online friends with like-minded players who embrace Siege’s team-centric mechanics. It’s more cerebral than the twitch-and-react shooters of the day like Call of Duty and Halo – which doesn’t make Siege better or worse, but it does make it refreshingly different.
Justin Davis	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/25/minecraft-story-mode-episode-3-the-last-place-you-look-review	 Minecraft: Story Mode Episode 3, titled The Last Place You Look, manages to cram in an impressive number of inventive action sequences in its two-hour running time without sacrificing its style, humor, suspense, or meaningful story advancement. It’s a much better example of how a story-driven Minecraft adventure can deliver family-friendly thrills than the disappointing Episode 2.   Watch the first minutes of Episode 3 above. Things start off with a bang, thanks to the lengthy opening credits serving as one giant interactive action sequence where Jesse and the gang must fight their way through a group of enemies to avoid being caught in a giant monster grinder.  There are multiple tense encounters with Minecraft’s always-creepy Endermen. Although The Last Place You Look contains a couple of decent puzzles, this action emphasis continues throughout the episode. An underwater escape, multiple tense encounters with Minecraft’s always-creepy Endermen, and a climactic encounter with Story Mode’s big baddie are just a few of the action sequences included.   Although I applaud Episode 3 for giving us more to do, the button-prompt quick time events themselves remain so-so. There isn’t any consistency into which button corresponds to which action - attack, jump, or any other scripted action can be mapped to any face button or trigger seemingly at random. Story Mode’s forgiving difficulty - you can fail one or two button prompts and your character will still succeed on-screen, with only repeated failures resulting in a “game over” screen - also contributes to the the overall unsatisfying feeling of much of the action. It feels loose and a little random. Still, letting us participate in the on-screen drama is always preferable to passively absorbing it for minutes at a time, with no need to touch the controller. Thankfully, with one notable exception, Episode 3’s storytelling bounces back from Episode 2’s lows. It’s funnier, thanks in large part to the introduction of the eccentric, hermit-like Soren. Soren’s obsession with Endermen and inability to talk to people without making things super awkward quickly made him my favorite member of The Order of the Stone.    Why is Lukas suddenly acting like a completely different person? Most of the dramatic turns, including one particular moment at the episode’s close, also kept me invested. Jesse’s “super cool / semi-rival” friend Lukas feels like he was written by an entirely different team in this episode, though. The change in tone was so abrupt and extreme that it made me feel like I was missing something. Why is he suddenly acting like a completely different person? Is it a weird side-effect of Telltale’s branching storylines rejoining in a weird way? I’m not sure. But a lot of Episode 3 revolves around this interpersonal drama, and in my story it seems to come out of nowhere. Lukas’s behavior might have left me scratching my head, but solid character moments with Petra and even your pet pig Reuben make up for this oddness. The Last Place You Look’s excellent pacing makes it tough to dwell on these concerns for long, thankfully. It introduces and resolves episode-specific obstacles, almost all involving Endermen, to great effect, while deftly balancing and advancing the over-arching story at the same time. It’s an impressive balancing act. And as always, Story Mode’s sets remain a highlight. The massive monster grinder and Soren’s impressive constructions made the Minecraft fan in me marvel at their size and complexity. The Last Place You Look effectively gets Story Mode back on track. The action, humor, and drama are all improved, and Story Mode continues to use Minecraft elements like mob grinders and Endermen to great effect. More improvements need to be made for Story Mode to be considered one of Telltale’s greats, but for now it is moving in the right direction.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	 Star Wars Battlefront captures everything I love most about Star Wars. It’s playful and imaginative, driven by a sense of adventure and fun above all else. By embracing this, and improving on the classic original Battlefront, developer DICE has made almost exactly the Star Wars multiplayer shooter I’ve always wanted. The catch is that this revival comes with baggage, and doesn’t always know what to do with itself.   There is an immaculate attention to detail in Star Wars Battlefront, making it easily one of the best-looking games of the generation. Battlefront's stunning visual fidelity is even stronger on PC thanks to its modifiable settings. Cleaner textures, plus improved lighting and visual effects sell the exceptional aesthetic even better. Battlefront looks, feels, and sounds like the original trilogy in almost every way, from the scorch marks on X-wings to that specific spark and puff of smoke of blaster fire impacts. The incredible audiovisual experience is so convincingly authentic that anything out of place stands out vividly. DICE’s original score, for example, occasionally blends brilliantly with John Williams' original music, but sounds so wrong at times that I frequently turn music off entirely. And at best, the hero character performances and movie one-liners are weird and distracting. At worst, they’re pandering and awful.   DICE puts this great look and feel to use in a messy mountain of modes. Star Wars Battlefront is at peak quality in Supremacy, Walker Assault, and Drop Zone. These are focused, objective-oriented games that leverage a deep set of sandbox systems so that spectacular things never stop happening. Drop Zone is a fast and violent 8v8 race for map domination that rewards quick thinking. Seize control of crashed drop pods and you’ll earn victory points, one-time consumable items like mines and sentry turrets, and trigger the next drop. All of the explosives, heavy weapons, and buffs you unlock over time add to your combat options, too. Every player brings their own customized loadout to every battle, where they can adapt to new roles on the fly. This concoction of different people using varied items creates a beautiful chaos, and it only becomes more impressive as other modes add bigger player counts. Supremacy is the next logical step up from here. It encourages aggressive tactics as two teams of 20 wrestle for outpost control on a large map. The awesome driveable vehicles play a huge role here, with skillfully piloted AT-STs and X-wings able to make or break a match for a struggling team. The infantry combat dynamic shifts drastically when you’re suddenly taking heavy fire from above, driving everybody toward mounted weapons or protected areas. Smart Rockets, Orbital Strikes, and other expendable power-ups appear randomly, and work as great counter-measures when you’re lucky enough to find them. Plus, their explosions are the best.  Survival mode is Battlefront’s most unexpected success. To make rounds even more volatile, you can find pickups that spawn you as hero characters to bring big power to Supremacy and Walker Assault. Luke Skywalker can carve a safe path through stormtroopers for his team, while Boba Fett’s amazing jetpack-powered mobility and deadly blaster is a constant distraction for Rebels. Playing as – or just watching – the six available heroes is a major highlight in a multiplayer game, and impressive scenes are inescapable. Plus, each hero has fun new abilities that make them precious. The Emperor’s high burst damage offsets his lack of defensive options, while Princess Leia’s limited but extreme damage justifies her protective shield.  Walker Assault mode mixes all of these elements and throws them off balance, giving the Imperials a thematically appropriate advantage as AT-ATs march toward victory. They’re genuinely daunting vehicles, and bringing them down as the Rebels (by first capturing and holding points, then striking the walking tanks at moments of vulnerability) feels like a huge accomplishment. It’s satisfying in a different way than crushing the Rebels with that overwhelming force, but both teams are really fun. Between weapon loadouts, equippable items, vehicles, heroes, tension, tactics, variety, and the massive scale of the maps – set across Hoth, Endor, Sullust, and Tatooine – Walker Assault represents everything Battlefront does well.  While there’s no actual single-player campaign, Survival mode is Battlefront’s most unexpected success. The solo or two-player cooperative wave-based missions pit Rebel players against an onslaught of increasingly aggressive Imperials. New enemies with invisibility, jetpacks, extra armor, and shields force you to change the way you react to each assault. It’s especially rewarding on higher difficulties, so skip straight past the cakewalk default mode. Entertaining as these deep, involving missions are, once there aren’t many compelling reasons to replay a Survival mission you’ve finished.   Battlefront’s 13 maps are pretty much uniformly excellent. The remainder of Battlefront’s modes just feel like unfocused filler, or worse. First you’ve got the mediocre fights: Cargo is your usual camp-fest capture-the-flag mode – a decent change of pace for 12 players, but original in no way. Fighter Squadron is a good training ground for aspiring pilots, and both Slave I and Millennium Falcon are ruthless beasts in the skies, but aerial-only matches neglect a core component of top-tier Battlefront matches -- the excellent effect of infantry on the battlefield -- for a simplistic dogfighting deathmatch. And Blast is such a forgettable team deathmatch variant that I wonder why they even bothered. Then there are few modes I’d go so far as to call bad. Hero Hunt and Heroes vs. Villains have little to offer anyone already enjoying the competitive multiplayer. They’re hectic in a way that’s more confusing than entertaining, and barely in the Battlefront’s spirit of disposable soldiers annihilating each other. The anticlimactic alternative to Drop Zone is Droid Run, a meandering mode that has teams running in circles capturing mobile control points. Matches either end before they can become interesting, or disregard team strategy by making only the last minute matter.   However, even a poor mode benefits from a great map, and the good news is that Battlefront’s 13 maps are pretty much uniformly excellent. Each planet’s gorgeous environments cling to distinct visual and structural themes that make sense for Star Wars. Endor is dense, full of places to hide, and rich with great sniper spots, while Tatooine’s labyrinthian landscape is less predictable, allowing you to catch enemies off guard at any moment. Hoth has patches of extreme claustrophobia across its wide-open, trench-filled fields, which differs dramatically from Sullust’s combination of molten, rocky plains and Imperial technology. This gives each valley, structure, and cave a unique and new sense of dangerous place. The unfortunate side effect of these unlocks is that most arenas suffer from too few assigned spawn points, leading to devious and infuriating spawn-camping opportunities. Proximity mines, infantry turrets, and orbital strikes are particularly maddening to spawn into. This frustration is often made worse by the extremely generous auto-aim on consoles. Landmarks make each map more memorable than their actual designs, but the majority of these arenas are excellent. The best are, true to DICE form, absolutely massive with rich complexity. I’m still finding new routes through certain structures, new hiding spots, and better ways to bait-and-switch opponents.  Purchasable unlocks help here, too, particularly the Jump Pack, which lets you boost up or across an area. Battlefront’s infantry game changes in a terrific way when you’re able to boost away from incoming fire, or onto a previously inaccessible vantage point. Equippable items like this come in the form of unlockable Star Cards, which you can equip before each match. They’re varied, allowing for decently deep character customization instead of forcing your hand with class-based combat. You can increase damage resistance with one Star Card, bring a sniper rifle into battle with another, or build an entire loadout around blowing up vehicles. It’s the best way to spend any Credits earned in multiplayer, since the simple cosmetic customization is weirdly way more expensive than unlocking different blasters with varying range/fire rate/damage output. Star Wars Battlefront captures the essence of Star Wars beautifully, harnessing the most exciting and memorable pieces of the universe for a unique and spectacular combat sandbox. Aside from awkward performances and a poor original score, Battlefront is a master class in aesthetic authenticity.  Beyond a few essential modes built for casual competition, however, Battlefront is unfocused, relying on excess game types to compensate for an absent single-player campaign.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	 Most of the way this huge roleplaying-shooter game works is carried over from its excellent predecessors, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas. It is the Skyrim to Fallout 3’s Oblivion, if you will – it iterates on the previous game’s already amazing systems, and it’s similarly dense with locations to explore, genuinely creepy monsters to fight, and superbly engrossing post-nuclear atmosphere that blends unsettling gore and death with dark comedy. After more than 55 hours played I may have seen an ending, yet I feel like I’ve only begun to explore its extraordinary world; from the look of it, I’ll easily be able to spend another 100 happy hours here and still see new and exciting things.  Watch the first 20 minutes of Fallout 4 above. A story that begins as a basic search for your lost family evolves into something much more complex and morally nuanced. Like in Fallout: New Vegas, we’re drawn into a struggle between several groups competing for control of the region, and deciding which of their imperfect post-apocalyptic philosophies to align with made me pause to consider how I wanted events to play out. Even the highly questionable Institute has a tempting reason to side with them, and turning away from them in my playthrough wasn’t as clear-cut a choice as I’d expected. I was impressed by the sympathy shown toward the villains, too - even the most irredeemable murderer is explored and given a trace of humanity.    The main story isn’t nearly as gripping an attraction as the huge number of well-written side quests. Of course, as is the tradition with developer Bethesda Game Studios’ open-world RPGs, the main story isn’t nearly as gripping an attraction as the huge number of well-written side quests you’ll come across just by wandering through the ruins of the Boston area, now known as The Commonwealth. I found it difficult to complete even the most basic point-A-to-point-B task without being sidetracked at least twice by enticing detours. An abandoned comic book publisher office? How can I not explore it? Boston’s famous Fenway Park? Gotta see what’s become of that. A crumbling high school with heads on pikes outside? I bet there’s great loot in there! Practically tripping over new discoveries like this, I feel like a kid on Easter whose parents are bad at hiding the candy.  Watch a 24-hour time lapse above.  Attention to detail is evident everywhere. Exploration has its own rewards, as this is the most diverse Fallout world yet, with dilapidated urban areas, ominous dead forests, eerie swamps, a desolate area mired in a hellish radioactive haze, and even some areas that look borderline hospitable like beaches and budding farms. The Commonwealth’s much more color-saturated than Fallout 3’s Capital Wasteland, though it has its fair share of grays and browns, and it shares New Vegas’ bright blue sky (as opposed to oppressive clouds) when it’s not night time or raining or green with a terrifying radiation storm. It’s often beautiful. Attention to detail is evident everywhere – Fallout 4 might not be a leader in all areas of graphics technology (character animations are still a weakness) but from the intricate Pip-Boy wrist-computer interface (which completely changes when you’re in power armor), to careful arrangement of skeletal remains that tell the tragically dark or tragically funny stories of long-dead characters, to tattered poster art on the walls, to even raindrops on your visor (if you’re wearing one) it’s consistently impressive.   Perhaps because this adventure is such a long haul, Fallout 4 is  a bit overeager to hook us in the beginning. After a brief glimpse of pre-war life in Fallout’s familiar-but-strange near-future and a retelling of the events on the day the bombs fell in 2077, we barely have time to get our hands dirty in the post-apocalyptic era before Fallout 4 throws us into a big action moment: You’re given a suit of the big, stompy power armor and a heavy weapon, and put into an intense brawl against the series’ most iconic monster.  Above: Vault IGN discusses the first things we'll do in Fallout 4. It’s certainly not an unconventional idea for a game with a long progression arc to give us an early taste of the powerful toys we’ll gain access to later in order to motivate us to work for them, but with Fallout it’s a misstep that trods on the series’ beloved feeling of working our way up from almost nothing to become the dominant force in the wasteland. This bothered me less and less as I began to explore, but knowing that armor was available when I wanted it made me a little cockier than I wanted to be when setting out into a hostile, unforgiving world.    The decision of what to do with the single point you get each level has a significant impact. One of the first things a returning Fallout player will notice after creating a character with the intuitive push-and-pull face-sculpting tool is that the entire concepts of skill points and traits have been consumed by the perks system, unifying all character progression under one big, elaborately animated Vault Boy chart with so many unlockable options you have to scroll through them to see them all. While this streamlining does mean giving up a lot of minute control over where your character improves with each level, it also means the decision of what to do with the single point you get each level has a significant impact, and therefore those decisions represent a commitment and are tough to make: do you want to spend it on a new low-level perk, increase the level of an existing one, or pump it into a SPECIAL attribute like Luck to boost certain stats and also open up a new, more powerful perk, like the Mysterious Stranger, that you’ll be able to unlock with your next level?  Watch the Fallout 4 Launch Trailer above. These might be more general, jack-of-all-trades types than previous Fallout character builds, in that you generally don’t have any crippling deficiencies, but they definitely have their distinguishing features that’ll make one playthrough feel different from the next. And before you lament it as a “dumbing down” of Fallout’s overall complexity, turn your eye to the new crafting and equipment progression system, which has picked up the slack by becoming vastly more complicated and interesting.    Fallout 4’s crafting system gives even more motivation to compulsively collect everything that isn’t nailed down. As if I didn’t already have enough of a hoarding problem, Fallout 4’s crafting system gives even more motivation to compulsively collect everything that isn’t nailed down. It’s so easy, too - grabbing things out of containers happens quickly in window that pops up when you look over it. Every item in the world is made up of material components, most of which you can intuitively guess: bottles are needed for glass, a desk fan will provide you with steel and gears, and a roll of duct tape is worth its weight in gold. I once went on a desperate search for pencils so that I could extract the lead they contained to use for radiation shielding. (Apparently Fallout's alternate universe never switched to graphite.) Nothing is worthless junk, which means that managing the weight of your inventory is a constant series of agonizing decisions of what to take with you and what to leave behind.  Above: Catch up on the Fallout universe in (a little over) 5 minutes.  Nearly every modification you make is reflected in the look of your gun. The value of those materials comes from their use in the fantastic equipment upgrades, which give most guns you pick up extraordinary potential for flexibility and longevity. Stopping at a crafting bench with the right components in hand can turn a pistol into a short-range, pray-and-spray automatic or a scoped sniper with a long barrel for accuracy and a big stock to reduce recoil. A few tweaks to a standard-issue laser rifle can add burning damage over time, or split the beam into a shotgun-like spread. The best part is that those changes aren’t just tweaked numbers in the stats; nearly every modification you make is reflected in the look of your gun as well, creating an extremely varied selection of weapons both for you and for enemies.   Likewise, the new armor system lets you piece together six chunks of gear - helmet, chest plate, and each individual arm and leg - on top of your clothes to form cobbled-together, asymmetrical outfits that feel like exactly what someone who assembled their wardrobe by scavenging the wasteland should wear. The suit my character wears now has at least one piece from each major faction, reflecting both his allegiances and his victories over foes. And of course, armor can be upgraded using collected materials as well, though it sadly doesn’t have as dramatic a cosmetic effect as with weapons. The armor system suffers from some inconsistency: several times I was a little bit heartbroken to find a new outfit like a tuxedo or a Halloween costume, but couldn’t use them as the foundation of a new custom-built look. Only certain jumpsuits can have pauldrons and shin guards strapped onto them, it seems, and no distinction is made in the item description.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	 Rise of the Tomb Raider is the most fun I’ve had with a Lara Croft game since 1996. Its story is full of the right kind of danger and intrigue, its tombs are dastardly, and I was as struck by its huge, romantic environments as I was as a kid playing the original. Although I could have done with a few more puzzles and fewer firefights overall, I enjoyed every rollicking, big-hearted second of it.    It’s broad, Indiana Jones stuff that gallops along at a great clip. Like its predecessor, Rise of the Tomb Raider revels in an ever-so-slightly-sci-fi and ultimately very fun high-concept involving a hunt for an artifact that grants eternal life. It’s broad, Indiana Jones stuff that gallops along at a great clip through gloriously over-the-top sequences grounded with a strong emotional throughline. Rise of the Tomb Raider is, at its core, about Lara and her late father, and actress Camilla Luddington’s thoughtful performance as Lara sells us on the complicated relationship she has with the ghosts he left behind.   Above: Rise of the Tomb Raider - Xbox 360 v Xbox One v PC  As a character, Lara Croft has never been so endearing. Minute-to-minute, Lara shines. She’s confident and smart, and reacts to danger with an action hero’s calmness and intuition. Yet she’s scarred by her last adventure, so she carries a sort of charismatic weariness that tinges her quips with self-deprecation. As a character, Lara Croft has never been so endearing. Her ambitions are more complex, too. This time round she’s driven by obsession, not survival, and for the first time we see her in shades of grey. Unlike 2013’s Tomb Raider, I wasn’t wincing at her constant broken bones - she’s now a formidable fighter who inflicts more than she takes - but I did see the cracks in her moral compass.  Above: Watch IGN play one of RotTR's tomb puzzles. Elsewhere, Rise of the Tomb Raider’s supporting cast are less developed, but fortunately they occupy far less screentime than Lara’s juicy antagonists. To talk about these two - and the mysterious organization they associate with - in too much detail would spoil some great twists, but they’re morally grotesque foes, and their clash of wills result in moments of real darkness.    The most heart-hammering moments in Rise of The Tomb Raider come from frantic, acrobatic chases. Lara’s means of traversing her world has also been expanded upon. All her tools - which now include a wire spool for latching onto hooks while airborne and arrows Lara can use to climb up vertical surfaces - can be used in quick succession to keep her in the sky for longer. The most heart-hammering moments in Rise of The Tomb Raider come from frantic, acrobatic chases as I fumbled for the right button hundreds of feet above ground. Lara’s rope arrows get a lot more use, too, and the puzzles which utilize these span a remarkable range. One saw me blowing up a statue, another had me slowly and delicately equalizing the weight on a platform. A couple left me lingering idiotically around a rope-wrapped stump, clueless as to what to do with it, until that rush of relief when I spotted another in the distance. While puzzles have been baked deeper into the main storyline than they were in Lara’s last outing, the most interesting ones are still those that you have to hunt down on the side. Rise of the Tomb Raider’s ‘challenge tombs’, those that speak most strongly to Tomb Raider’s heritage, are its highlight; imaginative, environmentally gorgeous, and increasingly tough as you progress through the world. There are a couple by the end I spent a good hour or two on, but the elation I felt upon solving them was huge. My only real criticism of Rise of the Tomb Raider’s puzzle-solving is that there isn’t more of it. As I played through the main storyline, I increasingly found myself hurrying through combat sections just so I could branch off and hunt down my next puzzle fix, buried in the unsettled guts of an icy mountain or under a murky lake in the mouth of a cave.   Not that combat a chore. While its third-person shooting is the least inspired aspect of Rise of the Tomb Raider, Lara can now build nail bombs, smoke bombs, molotov cocktails, and special ammo while on the fly, all of which can turn a mundane shootout into a pile of dead bodies in seconds. It’s a fun, vicious, and slightly ridiculous new ability which adds a great deal of variety to enemy encounters.  She’s such a potent fighter that I didn’t find any real incentive to avoid combat altogether. It does, however, make Rise of the Tomb Raider’s much-touted stealthy approach rather redundant. While you do get XP bonuses for stealth takedowns and you can hide in bushes and up trees, she’s such a potent fighter that I didn’t find any real incentive to avoid combat altogether. It was much more enjoyable to cause as much destruction as possible and gain bonuses for headshots and multiple kills using a combination of crafted items and Lara’s significant arsenal. Happily, playing with the latter is still nice and crunchy. Weapons are upgradable based on parts you can find scattered throughout the world, which injects new novelty into combat every few hours. Like in the last game, I found myself gravitating towards the shotgun and bow; the former for its lethal incendiary bullets, the latter for its wide-reaching poison arrows. Lara’s as powerful as a Terminator by the end of Rise of the Tomb Raider on standard difficulty mode, however - something to be considered when choosing how you want to play.      The enormous, snowy mountains, crumbling tombs, and dark forests here have been built with great imagination. Outside of the main storyline there’s plenty to discover, and Rise of the Tomb Raider’s beautiful semi-open world provides the incentive to hunt for it. While pretty vistas have always been a calling card of the franchise, the enormous, snowy mountains, crumbling tombs, and dark forests here have been built with great imagination. A dark corner of a tomb might house a number of skeletons in stocks, eternally forced to pray at the feet of a statue. Take a left in a forest and you might discover a crypt, or swing ‘round a mountainside and meet the stoney face of some forgotten god of an ancient race. It’s meticulously crafted stuff. It isn’t purely exploration-driven, either. Besides the aforementioned optional tombs, there are mission-givers who you can return to for new jobs in exchange for coin, outfits, and XP, and area-specific challenges that offer rewards for exploration. For true completionists, there are plenty of relics, documents, murals and caves to discover, which can take an average playthrough from 15 hours to around 30 or 40. Rise of The Tomb Raider also offers additional play in its Expedition mode, which replaces 2013’s inessential multiplayer with a fun enough way to compete against yourself and your friends in challenges that you can customize through collectable cards. Modifiers can make you weaker (one life only) or stronger (stealth kills earn temporary invisibility), and timers determine who comes out on top.  Above: IGN's Icons series showcases Lara Croft. Though I certainly wouldn’t recommend paying for these cards with real-world money - an option you’re offered - I did earn enough in-game credits in the main storyline to buy a couple of packs that made for some hilariously off-beat challenges. Big Head mode coupled with a card that sees enemies burst into flame after a melee attack is a personal favourite.   PC Version - January 28, 2016 I played the Rise of the Tomb Raider PC port on an Intel i7-6700k @ 4GHz with 16GB RAM running Windows 7, with an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980 Ti with the January 27, 2016 Game Ready Drivers installed, as recommended by Square Enix for this particular port. Running on these specs at 1920x1080 resolution on the high graphics settings preset, Rise of the Tomb Raider looks stunning. Visuals are crisp; hair and shadows and facial textures in cutscenes are particularly improved over the Xbox One version. While stuttering and and tearing has been reported elsewhere, I noticed only the occasional stutter in cutscenes. Further, my game ran fluidly at 60 frames per second in both dark, tight spaces and bright, broad environments with a lot of detail.   Above: The first 10 minutes of Rise of the Tomb Raider on PC My only criticism with the PC port is a stickiness when climbing using the mouse and keyboard; a couple of times Lara moved in a direction I didn’t intend her to move while stuck to a wall. With this in mind, I recommend using a gamepad for this port. Ultimately, Rise of the Tomb Raider looks best on PC - although be prepared for your hardware to be stretched if you intend to max out the settings. Rise of the Tomb Raider raises the bar set by Lara’s last outing with a rollicking adventure story, strong villains, gorgeous vistas, and smart puzzles – go off the main path to find the best stuff in dastardly optional tombs. Though the mandatory combat doesn’t distinguish itself with challenging enemies unless you crank up the difficulty, Lara’s newfound versatility on the battlefield makes fighting a lot more fun. Once again it’s Lara herself, however, who steals the show, her complex ambitions and hardened resolve showing new sides to a character who has well and truly grown from survivor to the most fascinating action hero in video games today.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	 With alternate histories and crazy weapons, Treyarch’s Black Ops games have always been Call of Duty’s oddballs. After killing mind-wolves with a swarm of nano-bees in the new campaign, I’m happy to say Black Ops 3 not only continues that trend, but smartly embraces its sci-fi oddities more than ever before.   Watch the first 15 minutes of Black Ops 3 above. But the most remarkable thing about Black Ops 3 isn’t its tone; it’s the sheer amount of content which, at its best, is some of the greatest I’ve seen in Call of Duty (note: the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions lack many of the features of the current-gen and PC version). Multiplayer still has the depth fans expect by now, but the addition of unique Specialists makes every player more important. Likewise, the option for four-player co-op and the new focus on playing how you want make the campaign and Zombies modes more rewarding and fun to play than they’ve ever been.   The six-hour story is set in the not-too-distant future, and, like most similar sci-fi fare, it includes its own techno-gibberish to get used to. Black Ops 3 settles on “Direct Neural Interface,” or DNI for short. This ubiquitous technology allows humans to mentally interact with computers, weapons, and other people. It introduces both terrific new abilities and important new limitations that changed the way I thought about playing Call of Duty. For example, you can’t use enemies’ dropped weapons because they’re registered to someone else’s brain – hence Black Ops 3’s focus on cool new combat powers.  Humans can mentally interact with computers, weapons, and other people.  Without getting into spoilers, I’ll say that Black Ops 3 didn’t spend enough time making me care about its characters before it tried to cash them in for an emotional payoff. It’s disappointing, because Black Ops 3 begins to explore some genuinely interesting and taboo topics: What happens when people no longer own their thoughts, or when they don’t receive the mental health care they need? The answer: kill more robots!   Killing more robots (and other enemies) is actually quite fun thanks to the new powers, which come in three flavors: blow things up, beat things up, or control your enemies and have them blow things up for you. Each power tree promotes a certain style of play, and you don’t earn enough points to level up all three paths unless you choose to sacrifice extra perks, weapon upgrades, and more. Even then, you can usually only use one type per level, so committing to one path is important. Plus, this leaves enough points to beef up your trusty primary weapon, which feels more important than it ever has. The gun you pick will likely stay in your hands for the entire level.   Learn about Martial Cybercores in the video above. My powers of choice enhanced my up-close-and-personal combat skills – an altogether underexplored style in Call of Duty. My most-used skill was a charge ability that sent me flying across the battlefield at incredible speeds, killing weaker enemies and staggering the big ones. Other favorites include an area-of-effect ground pound, which was especially satisfying to use after leaping from up high. Invisibility was fun for sneaking into better cover and useful for giving me time to revive downed allies. I haven’t seen this kind of utility in a Call of Duty game before, but it’s a terrific addition. These powers really shine when you throw another player or three into the mix. In my playthrough, my co-op partner was the “blow things up” guy – a ranged damage dealer and disabler. He could ignite enemies with the wave of a hand, set loose a swarm of bees, and more. When we needed specific enemies dead as soon as possible, his powers took care of it. Also, his bees distracted enemies, giving me time to line up my charge ability (which can be tough to steer) and hit multiple enemies in one blast.  Ignite enemies with the wave of a hand and set loose a swarm of bees.  A more general tactic was for me to charge to the other side of the battlefield and flank the enemy from a spot that I couldn’t have made it to at normal running speeds. Many of the levels accommodate tactics like this, and using the environments, powers, and good ol’ cooperation satisfied me in a way a Call of Duty campaign never has before. Powers are on a cooldown, so they don’t make Black Ops 3’s excellently refined shooting obsolete. By design or by coincidence, it often felt like my powers came off cooldown right when my guns ran out of ammo. This let me continue the fight, find cover, or survive long enough for my allies to save the day. Black Ops 3’s enemies are varied and competent, but when I replayed a few campaign missions they acted pretty much the same as they did before. Without the new abilities, there wouldn’t be much of a gameplay reason to replay the story.   Learn everything you need to know about Black Ops 3 in the video above. On your first run, you’ll commit to one style. On a second or third run, your character will unlock the ability to switch between different power types in the middle of a mission, opening the door for fun new combinations. The first time I played through one area, I charged around the battlefield, slaying as I went. The second time I sat behind cover, happily hacking drones and using them to clear the way. It’s refreshing to play a Call of Duty level and have more options than “shoot that guy again, but with a different gun.”  If you want to fight for every single inch, Realistic mode is excellent. Using powers effectively is pretty much mandatory if you want to even try to survive the new “Realistic” difficulty mode, where one bullet is often enough to take you out. I’m not up for the challenge, but if you want to fight for every single inch, Realistic mode is excellent at running you through the wringer.   I was surprised and disappointed to find that many of the great high-mobility mechanics Treyarch revealed for Black Ops 3’s multiplayer, such as firing while performing other actions or wall-running, at first seemed disabled in campaign. On closer inspection, I found them locked away in an odd part of the tech tree. On one hand it’s commendable that Treyarch wants to give us the option to ignore the new mobility skills and play a more classic style of Call of Duty – there’s even a tech upgrade that allows you pick up any weapon you find, just like the old days. On the other, it would’ve been better if they weren’t so easy to miss that I didn’t even get a double-jump for my whole first playthrough. In multiplayer, everyone has a thruster pack regardless of their loadout – similar but different enough from last year’s Advanced Warfare that learning to use it effectively was a new challenge.   Watch the Free Run obstacle course mode in the video above.  Fast battles can start at any time and from any angle. The new thruster pack movements feel smooth, easy to control, and offer tons of precision. They’re great for chasing down or escaping from enemies, reaching objectives quickly, and navigating levels without overshooting your target. Because you can always fire your weapon, there’s often no need to think twice about bouncing off walls like a caffeinated hamster. Being out of cover makes you a big target, but at least you’re a target who can fight back. This makes for fast battles that can start at any time and from any angle, thanks to maps that were built with enough paths and shortcuts to make use of your skills. Complex motions like running along a wall, firing at an enemy, and then hopping to a different wall are difficult to perfect, but Black Ops 3 includes four excellent American Gladiators-style Free Run courses to test your skills outside of live multiplayer. It records your best completion times too, so this mode will have legs.   Black Ops 3’s competitive multiplayer brings back the same reliable Pick-10 loadouts, which let you select 10 weapon attachments, perks, grenades, and more to take into battle. This isn’t anything new, but it’s still a solid system that ensures you can go into a match with exactly the gear you want, and nothing more. Multiplayer includes a huge array of unlockable guns, perks, and gear that let you mold a playstyle of your own. It’s excellent, but at this point Call of Duty fans should expect nothing less. The important new change for multiplayer is that you no longer play as generic soldiers. Before a match begins, you pick a Specialist to play as – anything from a murderous robot to an elite archer. Each Specialist has one exclusive power and one exclusive weapon, and you get to take one of the two into battle.   Watch a full Hardpoint match in 1080p 60fps above.  Special powers and guns aren’t a free win button. This is one of the best decisions Treyarch made for Black Ops 3’s multiplayer. Because each character is useful, and because there are nine Specialists, there’s no way for a team to have every power and every weapon available.  So more than ever before, you have a chance to be useful even if you’re not the most skilled player. If you pick the character who can see enemies through walls for a short time, you are invaluable for warning your team about incoming foes. If you grab the new Hive weapon, you can set up proximity traps to cover the weak points in an otherwise strong defense. Special powers and guns aren’t a free win button, though. If you pop your special and get killed a second later you need to wait for it to recharge, even after a respawn.   The new Zombies co-op mode, Shadows of Evil, is the best version of the undead slaying mode in Call of Duty yet. It has its own progression system, the 1940s urban-style setting is gorgeous, and it’s a place where a magician played by none other than Jeff Goldblum says lines like “With each subsequent transformation I grow ever more confident with my tentacles.”   Watch the first 15 minutes of Zombies as Jeff Goldblum above. Shadows of Evil’s four noir-esque characters – a magician, a boxer, a cop, and a burlesque dancer – are liars and killers thrown together against their will,  and each is introduced with a great short video that shows them at their worst. It’s interesting to see what kind of information they do and don’t share with their new companions.  Shadows of Evil’s four noir-esque characters are liars and killers.  It plays much like the Zombies mode has before, with players earning money for repairing barricades, killing enemies, and more, then using it to buy upgrades to survive the next wave. However, thanks to a new persistent XP and perks system, you can customize weapons and abilities before a match begins – you won’t likely see everybody running around with the same guns this time. The mode lasts as long as you can hold out, so specializing your characters becomes more important as the difficulty ramps up. One big new addition to Zombies is the ability to “Become the Beast.” At certain fiery shrines, you can transform into a tentacled, lightning-spewing monster that rips the undead apart. It’s incredibly powerful, but it doesn’t last long, and you can’t use it very often. Some of the best and most tense moments in Shadows of Evil come from quickly having to decide as a group whether you can handle the current wave, or whether you’ll die without using the Beast. From its four-player co-op campaign to the brand-new powers and a fleshed-out Zombies mode, Black Ops 3 meaningfully pushes the Call of Duty series forward on several fronts. Even where it doesn't innovate, it still meets the high bar Call of Duty fans should expect. Black Ops 3 isn't the best Call of Duty game ever, but it's the biggest and most feature-packed game we've seen out of the series yet.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/darksiders-2-deathinitive-edition-review	 When IGN first reviewed Darksiders 2 on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U back in 2012, we gave it score of 7.5, for “Good.” Here’s what we said then: “Despite its problems, I was compelled onward in my quest with Death because Darksiders 2 is simply a fun game. The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It’s a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for. Still, if you love action adventure games, it’s certainly worth checking out - but don’t expect it to rival the masterpieces it will inevitably call to mind.”   Check out the opening of Darksiders 2 in 1080p above.  Darksiders 2’s kitchen-sink approach to gameplay and mechanics mostly holds up well. Three years after its initial release, developer Vigil’s dark, massive, Zelda-like is back on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition. This current-gen remaster takes all of the puzzles, exploration, and loot-crazy action of the original game, packs in a wealth of DLC, and improves the whole package while running at 1080p, making it the best version of the game. That said, it’s not necessarily worth revisiting for those who’ve already completed Death’s journey. Darksiders 2’s kitchen-sink approach to gameplay and mechanics mostly holds up well. The combat is still very much inspired by God of War’s light, heavy, and airborne attacks, and slashing my way through masses of creatures feels nice and responsive. The inclusion of all of the DLC is a nice bonus, even if most of it is just a handful of new weapons and armor to add to your pile of hundreds that you’ll gather throughout the loot-heavy adventure.   Watch the above video to see Darksiders 2's Zelda influences. Traversing across the colorful world on horseback and grabbing dozens of quests from a slew of fantasy tropes creates an effective, if not entirely inspired flow that makes the adventure feel like a single-player MMORPG. While the visual improvements don’t change the fact that the story is pretty dumb and relies a bit too heavily on the teenage angst of Death and his brothers, the varied environments make exploration an enjoyable experience, especially when you get into any of the many fantastic dungeons. Dungeons unfold in interesting, satisfying ways.  Yes, the dungeons are clearly inspired by The Legend of Zelda’s, but they unfold in interesting, satisfying ways. You solve smart puzzles that require paying attention to your surroundings, find keys through exploration, acquire a new weapon or tool that rewards you with a great sense of progression, then use that to ultimately slay a final boss. That being said, there’s little here to make me want to take a second dip in the 30-hour adventure, so the Deathinitive Edition caters more to people who missed out on the game back in 2012. Darksiders 2: Deathinitive Edition brings the original’s diverse world, interesting dungeons, and great loot system to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. Sure, the story is dull, and there aren’t a whole lot of original ideas at play here, but the vast expanse of the adventure should please anyone who missed out on it the first time around.
Justin Davis	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	 Rather than building on its promising debut, Episode 2 of Minecraft: Story Mode stumbles. Called Assembly Required, it still has all of Episode 1’s flaws, while introducing a few new ones of its own. Most of the humor and heart that balanced out the premiere’s weaker elements and kept it enjoyable are sadly also absent. Combine all this with a distressingly short running time and the end result is a brief, forgettable adventure that feels of little consequence.  Your decision determines which land you visit. At the end of Episode 1, the stakes are made clear and the stage has been set. Jesse and his friends must reunite the legendary (or are they?) heroes The Order of the Stone to save the world from destruction. The episode ends with a trademark Telltale choice that had me scratching my chin in consideration: should I travel with one friend to recruit the brainy Order engineer Ellegaard, or go with another to find the Order’s “griefer,” Magnus? In a bold move, this choice proves real in Assembly Required. Your decision determines which land you visit, complete with separate dialogue, sets, and characters. The two story paths don’t rejoin one another until 30 minutes in – a forking path much larger than is typically seen in an episodic game.    I cleared all of Assembly Required in just a scant 65 minutes. Unfortunately, this design comes at a cost. I cleared all of Assembly Required in just a scant 65 minutes, and that was with me taking my time to explore and talk whenever I had the option. If you count the large branching path, this episode probably has around as much total play time as most Telltale episodes, but a large portion of it can only be experienced in a second playthrough. Depending on how you like to play your stories (and if you consider your first experience “canon”) that’s either a strength in its replayabilty or a weakness of its available content. In part due to its brief duration, Assembly Required does little to clear up the confusion I feel about this world and its rules. At one point a character falls down a pit and is trapped. Why can’t they build their way out? Everyone is shown building huge structures in Episode 1’s opening. On a larger scale, a crux of Story Mode’s plot is using a special amulet and map to find the missing Order members. But one of them is found running a seemingly normal town, with normal citizens. Why couldn’t our party have just walked there? I’m not sure.   Missed Episode 1? Catch up on our review above.  Most of Assembly Required’s drama also feels muted. Assembly Required does feature more of the same whimsical fun with elaborate Minecraft contraptions found in Episode 1 - the chicken-torturing device found there is trumped by a new cow launcher, and a giant automated mech. It’s fun to see Story Mode bring these Minecraft contraptions to life, but most of the humor found in the writing around them falls flat. Likewise, most of Assembly Required’s drama also feels muted, relegated to tension between the reunited Order members. This makes Story Mode feel a little odd - it’s a game set in the present that often devotes its screen time to characters arguing about the past. It’s too far removed from Jesse, your decisions, and solving the world-ending dilemma at hand. Although you are given some one-on-one screen time with your badass adventuring friend Petra, giving her a bit more depth, Jesse’s relationship with his other friends is barely advanced, which feels like a missed opportunity. Thankfully, the authentic, detailed, and massive sets remain a highlight of Story Mode.  Wandering through Ellegaard’s automated Redstone techno-lair, and later through a massive underground fortress, does as much to help with the characterization of their fictional creators as their actual dialogue in many cases, and left me wondering how Telltale actually created them. Yet there is once again disappointingly little to do in them, and almost no freedom to truly wander. Minecraft: Story Mode Episode 2: Assembly Required is disappointingly short, and adds to Episode 1’s problems with establishing its world and its characters rather than reducing them. Telltale should be commended for creating a real diverging path that sends us to different, impressively designed places based on our choices, but doing so has illustrated why this kind of forked storytelling is rarely done: your journey seems half as long as what the developers actually created, and there’s not enough to do along the way.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/wwe-2k16-review	 Wrestling games have been lost in a foggy region between arcade and simulation for well over a decade, but last year, WWE 2K15 took a big risk by pushing further into simulation territory than ever before. Despite how divisive this decision proved to be, WWE 2K16 doubles down on that, and it’s all the better for it. I’m used to thinking about resource management and move spacing when I play fighting games, but not in a wrestling game. 2K16 has me thinking that way, and it rewards me for it, and despite the fact that it’s still missing some features I love, that kept me coming back bout after bout.  Developers Yukes and Visual Concepts were on the right track last year when they added a stamina system and a chain wrestling system to create a greater sense of pace, and they’ve built on those successes beautifully.   At the center is the reworked reversal system, which makes reversals a limited, slowly regenerating resource. Managing it correctly means you’ve got the ace in the hole you need to escape scary late-match situations, where a less frugal opponent might find themselves forced to absorb a beating. Not only does this create a welcome layer of decision-making previously absent from the series, it adds an extremely meaningful differentiation between characters, as some have more reversal stocks than others.  Working in tandem with the excellent reversal system are the new Working Holds. Wrestling smarks know these are holds that performers use to catch their breath mid-match, and WWE 2K16 smartly incorporates them in a competitive context here. Successful working holds restore your stamina while sapping your opponent’s - effectively allowing you to stall out their offense until you can get some reversal stocks back. That’s just one possible tactic you might employ. The pressure to stall or scrape by until you have the resources you need, and the incentive to force your opponent to waste theirs opens the fighting up tremendously. The net result is matches that have a greater sense of variety and ring psychology.  Options I used to never care about, like escape-rolling out of the ring, or having a manager distract my opponent suddenly become totally valid choices, since it buys me time to catch my breath. I’ll lay on the ground and let my opponent land a few kicks if I see them getting close to having a finisher, since that’s the bullet that needs dodging. I even started learning which moves, when reversed, give me a big enough window of opportunity to get an attack in, letting those that don’t slide. The net result is matches that have a greater sense of variety and ring psychology; blurring  the line between playing to win and putting on a show.   Most wrestling fans agree that showmanship is at least as important as technical, in-ring ability, and WWE 2K16 doesn’t quite nail all its big spots in this regard. Technically, it’s kind of all over the place: there are no load times between ring entrances, lending a seamless, TV-broadcast feel to match openings, but the loads between other modes, and even just to preview a costume piece in create-a-wrestler can be painful. Sometimes the AI behaves uncannily like the wrestler you know and love, like when Seth Rollins tries to DQ himself to retain the belt, and other times, they quizzically zone out and sort of stare off into space.  This same inconsistency spills over into other areas. Visually, some character models and effects look terrific, like during Randy Orton’s ring entrance, while guys like Chris Jerico seem to be holdovers from the last-gen days. WWE 2K16 doesn’t quite nail all its big spots  Finally, the commentary has improved greatly, with far fewer repeated phrases, and more specific insight into many wrestlers’ fighting style and history, but it’s not all the way there yet. There are still a few too many general move callouts, making the play-by-play a bit flat at times. No one issue is big enough to ruin the fun, but together they can periodically undercut the tension and excitement the in-ring action builds so effectively.   The biggest criticism leveled at last year’s game was the anemic roster, and the overall lack of modes and features compared to prior years. WWE 2K16 largely rectifies this, but its bag of tricks hasn’t quite gotten back to the point of overflowing yet. The one exception is in the roster which is, quite frankly, nuts. In terms of separate individual wrestlers, you’re looking at over 120, including many NXT-born stars, who fans were clamoring for last year. Not only are they a joy to play in their own right, but they add some much-needed diversity to the roster.  In terms of match types, much of what we lost last year is back. There are exceptions: no backstage brawl, no 2 out of 3 falls, no inferno etc. Honestly, very little that I cared about hasn’t returned, but it would be nice to see these modes come back in future iterations. Still this represents a huge improvement over last year’s sparse match offerings. The roster is, quite frankly, nuts.  Core modes like create-a-wrestler and MyCareer have been expanded considerably, with the latter spanning multiple years instead of ending with a single Wrestlemania appearance. Diva, belt, and arena creation are thankfully restored. Universe has even more ways to customize your WWE sandbox, including detailed personality sliders that affect in ring behavior.As has become expected, 2K Showcase is back, and is still a great mix of history and fantasy recreation. I miss create-a-story and create-a-move, but even without them, there’s still plenty you can do with this toolset.  WWE 2K16 takes a big step back towards being the exhaustive suite of wrestling wish-fulfillment it’s expected to be, but that, for me, is not the reason I’ll keep playing. I’ll keep defying gravity as Adrian Neville, and defying expectations as Dolph Ziggler, because WWE 2K16 is as close to a fusion of performance and competition as a wrestling game has ever gotten. That’s what I come to wrestling for, and that’s what 2K16 delivers.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	" When IGN reviewed Divinity: Original Sin on PC last year, we gave it a 9 for “Amazing.” Here’s what we had to say: ""Divinity: Original Sin is one of the most rewarding RPGs to come along in years. Its quests and combat compelled me to think hard about my actions and choices, which is more than I usually get to say about contemporary RPGs. Its depth, personality, and combat challenges easily allow it to hold its own against the likes of heavyweights like Dragon Age: Origins.""   It was difficult to imagine Original Sin’s old-school complexity working on consoles (read our full review for Divinity: Original Sin for complete details), but Enhanced Edition successfully makes it happen without any sacrifices. Though the same inventory criticisms apply, the highly interactive world of Rivellon and the finely detailed RPG systems therein are completely intact.   Because of all of its complexity, there's an enormous amount of information to process in Original Sin, and Enhanced Edition does an excellent job of displaying it on a TV screen in a way that’s easily readable from the couch, and mapping controls to the gamepad accordingly. Independently managing the inventories of every member of my party is still the pretty fiddly and cumbersome , but thanks to smart use of selection radials and intelligent button mapping, it’s not too much of an issue. Triangle or Y always gives detailed info about what you’re looking at, and square or B always brings up a list of actions you can take on whatever you’re targeting. This consistency kept all the options and information readily and intuitively available, so I could make informed roleplaying decisions.   Enhanced Edition looks in line with the PC version at ultra settings. Visually, Divinity isn’t the flashiest dancer at the ball, but Enhanced Edition looks in line with the PC version at ultra settings, plus some reworked special effects. Its humble, Euro-Fantasy aesthetic serves dutifully, creating the right vibe for the D&D-esque trappings and mechanics.  And though it runs at only 30 frames per second on both consoles, performance is reliably steady, even during split screen co-op.   In terms of new content, the biggest addition is the full voicing of pretty much every NPC, which adds a layer of immersion to a world that was already very well-realized. New areas and skills have been added too, and while they’re appreciated, Divinity is already so large and exhaustive these feel more like cherries on top as opposed to a whole new scoop. For instance, the addition of dual wielding as a combat style helps make off-hand weapons more viable, but it isn't exactly a reason to replay if you've already sunk 100 hours into the original.  What might convince veterans to play again though, is the inclusion of split-screen local play, making the unique co-op potential of Original Sin easier to discover than with the online mode. Splitting your party up to explore separately and settling disputed quest choices with a virtual game of rock, paper, scissors adds a wonderful slice of actual pen-and-paper roleplaying to an experience that already feels like the genuine article. All of these features, including controller support and split screen co-op, are available on the free upgrade for the PC version. If you want the RPG with the most skills, the most stats to consider, and a world that constantly makes meaningful use of every line on your character sheet, there’s nothing else quite like Divinity: Original Sin Enhanced Edition. You can find RPGs that are prettier, more accessible, or less busy, but very few are as dedicated to the true spirit of role-playing as this one is."
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review	 In almost every way, Halo 5: Guardians is bigger than the already large and excellent games that came before it.   Watch the first 18 minutes of Halo 5 above. Developer 343 Industries has engineered the strongest combat Halo has ever seen, with tons of excellent weapons, varied maps, an expansive and intense new multiplayer mode joining a host of returning greats, and some game-changing new mobility. At the same time, Guardians repeats Halo 4’s mistake of telling a story that can’t stand on its own without Halo’s expanded universe. This hurts, but doesn’t ruin, its otherwise impressive cooperative campaign.   Make no mistake: though Spartan Jameson Locke and Master Chief share the cover of Halo 5, Locke is the main character. You play as him, leading Fireteam Osiris, in 80% of the campaign’s 15 missions, but he doesn’t have the charisma needed to fill that role. He falls into the same trap that ensnares many similar military-type main characters: Locke doesn’t really want anything for himself; he just wants to complete the mission that someone else gave him.  Locke doesn’t really want anything for himself; he just wants to complete the mission...  The lack of a hero with a cause to root for costs Halo 5’s bigger story dearly, which wastes some good potential. Though the plot is overly complicated and unclear at times, it’s interesting that the new threat is less black-and-white in its motives than the Covenant, the Flood, or the Forerunners. One great thing about this new story is that, after spending so much one-on-one time with Cortana in previous games, it’s refreshing to hear new voices share their stories about Halo’s universe. Learning backstories, such as how Osiris’ 22-year-old Spartan Vale came to learn the Elites’ language, is a neat, believable touch that’s well conveyed just through background chatter. Unfortunately, Master Chief’s Blue Team doesn’t get the same treatment.  Watch our profile on Master Chief above. If I didn’t know them from Halo’s expanded universe, I’d have only a weak idea about who Fred, Kelly, and Linda are, where they came from, or why I should care about them. What should be a meaningful reunion for Chief – a chance to again fight alongside the few who truly understand him – feels like business as usual, except with three extra guns behind his back due to lack of context. 343 has released an animated Fall of Reach series alongside Halo 5 that explains the origins of Blue Team, but it’s only included with pricey special editions.   It’s surprising the characters’ backstories weren’t worked into audio logs or something, considering how dense the seven-hour campaign is with other important stuff and secrets I missed at first glance. After a battle, I’d wander around Halo 5’s diverse locations looking for the thoroughly hidden skulls and realize I hadn’t even seen whole other rooms, hidden pathways, weapons, vehicles, and more. Halo 5’s levels often aren’t physically as big as areas in, say, Halo 3, but they’re so dense with things to discover that I didn’t miss the breathing room.  There are many more options available than “point four guns at the thing and shoot.”  This kind of design makes Halo 5’s campaign ripe for replaying, and well suited for the convenient drop-in, four-player (online-only) co-op it’s clearly made for. You and your friends can spread out, grab a variety of weapons, and use these levels to their fullest – maybe have one person sniping priority targets from the high ground, another sneaking off to activate auto-turrets, and the other two people engaging the rest of the enemies in mid-range fights. There are many more options available than “point four guns at the thing and shoot.” When playing solo, the new squad commands for your AI-controlled team (mapped to the D-pad) are about as simple as possible: stand over there, get in that vehicle, or shoot that enemy. This is a great quality-of-life improvement over past Halo games, where the only communication you could have with your NPC helpers was “Gimmie that gun you’ve got.” In addition, they seemed to know what I wanted them to do. I spent very little time waiting for allies to jump on my Warthog’s turret, or getting them to hop into a spare Ghost for some extra firepower and mobility. The targeting command is useful for taking out elusive enemies, especially if you and your teammates are spread out and have different angles on the same area.  Watch a full multiplayer match of Halo 5 above. The one issue I had with squad commands is that sometimes teammates just didn’t listen. I get it: If I run out into the middle of the enemies, die, and need to be revived, that’s a dumb move on my part and no sane teammate would want to make the same mistake. At the same time, when they sometimes decide to let me bleed out, it’s game over... so it’s frustrating when they inconsistently decide they don’t want to take one for the team.   Halo 5 also has the most satisfying arsenal in the series going for it, thanks to returning classics and design facelifts for guns that used to feel worthless. Old favorites like the battle rifle, Spartan laser, and trusty assault rifle look and feel great, and work in new ways with the new hover mechanics. One unexpected standout is the Suppressor, a Forerunner assault rifle that’s mediocre in Halo 4. It now fires homing projectiles, which are perfect for hunting down Halo 5’s quicker enemy types.  I was constantly trying to fit three or four really cool weapons into my two slots. A few weapons are disappointing, like the new Hydra Launcher. That monstrosity looks huge and menacing, but the homing rockets it fires don’t do enough damage to warrant a spot in my holster – especially since the campaign is so generous with handing out great guns. I was constantly trying to fit three or four really cool weapons into my two slots, which is a great problem to have. You’ll have plenty of things to shoot, thanks to Halo 5’s strong enemy variety. Forerunner troops are highly mobile and will dodge slower projectiles if you’re not careful. The annoying flying enemies that provide shields are much less prevalent than they are in Halo 4, so they still provide an occasional challenge without becoming overbearing.  Watch Halo 5's launch trailer above. The major negative standout here is the series of boss battles with a similar enemy type, who really drives home that Halo 5 is a co-op-first campaign. This guy’s weakest point is on his back, which is hard to shoot without a real human being helping to distract it. In co-op it’s fine, but if you’re playing solo there’s no way to spread out your AI to get different angles, making it more frustrating than fun.  Invisible Elites have much more convincing active camo...  Old-school Covenant soldiers are as strong as they’ve always been, with tough enemies like sniper Jackals and Hunter pairs. One major improvement is the invisible Elites, whose much more convincing active camouflage effect is one of the benefits of Halo 5 being native to the Xbox One. I was taken out by surprise much more frequently by the stealthy warriors, but not so often that it felt cheap – it was nice to be surprised and outsmarted. Of course, Halo 5 also looks better in all the ways you’d expect from a generational leap forward. The campaign takes us to an eerie abandoned research station, a backwater planet ripe with odd, gorgeous life and vegetation, ruins with ancient and worn-looking monuments, and several other excellent looking locations. There is detail everywhere, and it contributes greatly to the fantasy.   Where single-player has its successes and failures, Halo 5’s multiplayer is one big, sustained high point. The new headliner mode is Warzone, and it's so fun and full of exciting tension that I could ignore the rest of the modes and be satisfied with Halo 5. Think of Warzone as an expanded, 24-player version of Halo’s old Big Team Battle playlist – but in addition to fighting the other team, you’re racking up points by capturing locations and killing roaming NPC bosses like tank warlords or super-strong Hunters. Two different victory conditions –  either earning 1,000 points before the other team, or by destroying the enemy team’s base – make it dangerous to get complacent when you’re way ahead in either race. Great comebacks are entirely possible.   Watch a video explanation of Halo 5's REQ system above. Warzone’s maps are up to four times larger than the biggest previous Halo maps to accommodate so many players and vehicles, but are cleverly designed with several close-quarters pathways and hiding spots to give infantry a fighting chance. These matches are often 20 to 25 minutes long, and require a new aspect of combat that Halo’s classic modes don’t have: resource management.    That frugal enemy might turn the tables by rolling into your base equipped with a Scorpion tank. Each player slowly earns REQ points over time, which can be spent on power weapons, vehicles, power-ups, and more. If you spend a few points each time you spawn, you’ll probably have better weapons than the average enemy you square off against, making them relatively easy targets. However, that frugal enemy might turn the tables 10 minutes down the line by rolling into your base equipped with an expensive Scorpion tank while you have only enough money for a battle rifle. It’s well balanced: no strategy seems dominant, and nothing can trump good old-fashioned mechanical skill. A good player could approach that tank under cover, dodge a shot, land on the tank, and destroy it with a grenade and a few punches. Smarts and skill will still win the day.   Watch Halo 5 Warzone gameplay above. But of course, Warzone is just one mode among many. Arena is classic Halo at its finest: 4v4, with well-designed maps that don’t heavily favor one strategy over another, and a broad variety of modes like Slayer, CTF, and the fan-favorite fast-kill mode, SWAT. Its slew of maps and cosmetic armor customization options is impressive, and the addition of visible timers above power weapon spots creates exciting clashes like clockwork. Halo 5’s new mechanical improvements apply to multiplayer as well as campaign. The most notable of those mechanics (which include the ability to quick-dash in any direction) is the hover jets. In previous Halos, jumping launched you on a predictable trajectory, essentially giving adversaries free time to line up headshots or toss a grenade on the area where you were about to land. Halo 5 shakes that up by introducing hover jets that activate when you aim down your sights while in the air, and now I don’t know how I played Halo without them.  After using the new hover jets, I don't know how I played Halo without them...  This tool allowed me to make new lines of sight at will, avoid explosions, and use splash damage weapons much more efficiently. Even better, it’s immensely fun to outsmart enemies with unexpected moves: you can pop out from cover – not just at the right or the left, but above it – get in a surprise shot or two, and then fight or run. Finally, it lets you set up the tough-to-execute ground-pound move that sends your floating Spartan crashing down on enemies below in a spectacular but risky finishing move. Clambering is a huge addition to your mobility as well. As long as you get within a reasonable range of a ledge, your Spartan will grab onto the ledge and quickly hoist itself up. Not only is this mechanic much simpler than the old duck-jumping trick, it also cuts down on the number of failed jumps when trying to get somewhere quickly. In game modes where time matters, this improvement is especially useful. In its 14 years, Halo has never felt so good to play. An updated arsenal and great new mobility mechanics give both campaign and multiplayer and modern touch without sacrificing Halo’s classic feel. It fails to introduce its new Spartan characters in a meaningful way, and the story does make some odd logical leaps, but it’s still fast, beautiful, and fun –  especially with four-player co-op. Guardians’ multiplayer harkens back to the Halo 2 glory days with tons of balanced maps and fun modes, and the tactical new Warzone mode absolutely steals the show.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	 Are you ready to rock? Well you’d better be, because Guitar Hero Live practically insists that you remain glued to the fretboard 24/7 with its addictive, always-on GHTV mode. This daring new streaming service works in tandem with a substantially redesigned guitar controller to compensate for a disappointing career mode and underdeveloped local multiplayer. The sum total is a largely enjoyable return to the stage for the series that once started a music game revolution.   It all starts with that new controller. Developer FreeStyle Games has refreshed the Guitar Hero experience considerably by adding a sixth button and splitting the frets into two rows: three black buttons, and three white. As someone who’s been playing GH games since banging out those first few power chords of I Love Rock and Roll in the original, I initially struggled to get to grips with the new button layout. At speed, it was tough for me to distinguish one black button from another, and hopping back and forth between the two rows almost always ended in me fumbling the transition and killing my multiplier. It takes time to adapt from coloured buttons to monochrome, but it's ultimately a change for the better. Yet at some point during my first late night it suddenly clicked, and now I feel like it would be a real step backwards to ever return to the old five-button design. Not only does this reconfigured button grouping keep your fretting hand rooted to the one spot, meaning your eyes never need to leave the screen, it just feels like a better approximation of actually playing the guitar - especially on the upper difficulty levels where the chord shapes and ascending and descending hammer-ons and pull-offs feel particularly analogous to the real thing.   My enthusiasm for this exciting new era of Guitar Heroism took a temporary dip, however, once I hopped into the career mode, GH Live. This is the mode that drops you into the shoes of the guitarist in about a dozen different fictional bands across two music festivals, experiencing each three-song mini-set as a first-person shredder. The problem with GH Live is not the overly cheesy vamping of the live-action bandmates around you, nor is it the way they dynamically chastise you when you flub a solo. No, the problem is that I simply didn’t care about them. So little context is given between sets – just some brief radio DJ banter and a few fake fan tweets – that when you’re just shunted from band to band every three songs there’s never any sense of camaraderie on stage. I didn’t feel like part of the band; I felt like a total stranger. The live performances are technically impressive, but you never feel connected to your bandmates. In fact, I felt more of a relationship with the crowd. Rock Band’s trick of getting audiences to sing along has been appropriated by GH Live, only in this instance you can actually look out on a sea of real faces singing back at you, which does feel pretty fantastic. But GH Live ultimately only served up an evening’s worth of shallow entertainment that I burned through as fast as I could mainly just to unlock its 42 songs (the only ones actually on the disc) for the quickplay mode.   The online-only GHTV mode is where the real depth of Guitar Hero Live lies. It’s also the part that could prove the most divisive for series fans, given it completely does away with the traditional approach to song DLC. Structured into two ‘channels’ (with a third to be added sometime after launch), GHTV livestreams blocks of scheduled, always-running music in programmed playlists with names like ‘90s Blockbusters’, ‘Metal Mayhem’, and ‘Pop Workout’. It’s broadcasting every hour of the day, and once you start it’s surprisingly hard to stop. Music videos play in the background as you jam along, delivering a healthy dose of nostalgia for those of us who grew up with music television that still actually showed music videos. As you play, you level up and earn credits to spend on useful things like multiplier boosts, and less useful things like customisable player cards for your profile.   More importantly, these credits can be spent on Plays, tokens that can be exchanged for a single on-demand play of any track from its substantial online catalog of songs - should you get impatient waiting for Rush’s Limelight to pop up in rotation, for example. It roughly breaks down to a ratio of earning one on-demand song per every five to 10 songs you play. This may sound like a grind, yet more than 20 hours into GHTV I’ve only ever used Plays on a handful of occasions. I simply haven’t needed to: in complete contrast to every other modern method I use to consume content, I’ve found GHTV’s scheduled song delivery surprisingly liberating. I don’t need to agonise over which song to buy or which song to play next, I can just sit back and let FreeStyle curate things for me. With rare exceptions I’ve consistently played songs I either love, didn’t know I loved, or at the very least were fun to play regardless. And thanks to the constant bombardment of music, I’ve often found it hard to put my guitar controller down - many times I’ve gone to turn it off, only for the opening notes of Judas Priest’s Breaking the Law to kick in, leaving me powerless to refuse.  But while I found this new streaming service a fun way to wield a plastic ax, for others it could be more of a double-edged sword. For example, if you’re the kind of player who wants to nail a wrist-crunchingly intense track like Lamb of God’s Ghost Walking at 100% on Expert, you’re probably going to burn through your Plays quickly trying to master it. It’s then that you’ll be forced to choose between grinding your way through other songs to earn more, or buying Plays instantly by using real money. The latter could easily become a costly habit. GHTV is also somewhat inflexible for the time poor. You’re basically going in blind every time you hop online - meaning that an evening of Guitar Hero you were looking forward to could quickly be quashed (or suddenly made more expensive) if you’re not into the genre that’s airing at the exact time you logon (an electronic programming guide app or something similar would be appreciated). I also found Guitar Hero Live a touch lacking in its support for local multiplayer. Yes, you can connect a second guitar and use your phone as a makeshift mic for vocals, but there is no option for a multiplayer career, and elsewhere the second guitar track is always identical to the first. Without the option of playing a mix of lead and bass or rhythm, Guitar Hero Live lacks the more collaborative feel of its predecessors. On the plus side, it also means you never have to get stuck actually playing bass (sorry, bass players).   Since reviewing the game on PS4 and Xbox One, I've been able to sample it on the Wii U, Xbox 360 and PS3 as well. All versions run more or less identically, with the exception of the Wii U which occasionally suffered from a stuttering note highway about once per song. After digging around on Guitar Hero Live's official support forums I discovered that the issue could be remedied by clearing the 2GB cache the game creates on your SD card. It's by no means a game breaking issue, but worth keeping in mind that extra hassle if you're deciding between formats. In many ways my experience with Guitar Hero Live can be summed up by the chorus from Faith No More’s Epic: “You want it all but you can’t have it.” No matter how much currency, real or virtual, you pump in, you’ll never actually own any of its growing library of songs beyond the 42 included on the disc. Yet, this restriction has in no way inhibited the fun I’ve had with it so far. The new guitar makes a tangible improvement to how you experience each and every riff and lick, and GHTV provides an almost irresistible service for enjoying tracks you love while discovering new ones, with absolutely nothing hidden behind a paywall. Guitar Hero Live might not return the series to the heights of its heyday, but it’s definitely the freshest and boldest Guitar Hero game in a very long time.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review	 Every year, the Assassin’s Creed series struggles with the idea of inheritance. Like its Templars and Assassins, who are locked in a never-ending struggle for relics, each game picks a side in the question of how strongly should it lean into its now-convoluted ancient lore and incorporate the still-underdeveloped present-day elements. Assassin’s Creed: Syndicate chooses wisely, leaves out multiplayer entirely, and pushes a lot of that baggage into the background, largely freeing itself up to make the most of Victorian London and have fun with sneaking, climbing, and stabbing.   Syndicate smartly negotiates this internal conflict by dramatising it in the form of its twin playable characters, Evie and Jacob Frye. The former is a devout Assassin, intent on stopping the Templars by tracking down the remaining pieces of Eden. Her brother Jacob, however, is a pragmatist – a social reformer who rails against the Assassin’s burdensome legacy and wishes to help his city in more immediate ways, seemingly embodying my desire to move on from the tangled mysticism. They’re both extremely likeable, well-drawn protagonists, and the interaction between the two is laced with a lively sibling rivalry that brings levity to otherwise-earnest cutscenes. But their contrasting worldviews have the greatest positive impact on Syndicate’s structure, which is both engaging and meaningful.   Watch the first 15 minutes of Assassin's Creed Syndicate above. You can freely switch between Jacob and Evie at most points, with side missions and open-world activities open equally to both. Campaign missions, however, are different, with Jacob taking the lead in the majority of the core assassinations. This is frustrating, especially since Evie is pitched as the more stealthy of the pair. But I soon realised that Syndicate is just not that interested in exploring forgotten tombs in search of dusty relics; it wants to liberate the great city of London from its terrible oppressors. And to be blunt, Syndicate’s a much better experience for identifying more closely with the goals of Jacob. Syndicate is just not that interested in exploring forgotten tombs in search of dusty relics  Despite being sidelined so often, Evie comes across as the more nuanced character, struggling with her sense of duty, where Jacob is a more straightforward bloke with clear goals. By the end of the 20-hour campaign, I felt like I’d probably spent more time with Evie due to prefering her in side missions, and I certainly knew her better. She sees the bigger picture, with her missions tackling problems Jacob can’t even comprehend. Evie also stars in my favourite assassination mission – a nighttime infiltration of the Tower of London.  Watch our PS4/Xbox One Graphics Comparison above. Given their differences, I was disappointed with how similar Jacob and Evie are to play. They each possess three high-level abilities designed around their supposed strengths of stealth and combat, respectively – Evie can effectively become invisible when stationary, for example, while Jacob has more deadly combos. But the rest of the abilities are identical. At first, I exaggerated the differences by investing all of Evie’s points into the stealth skill tree and Jacob’s into combat, thinking I could switch between the two depending on the situation. But since you can’t switch between characters within campaign missions, that’s not a viable approach. In one mission, I was playing as Jacob and it would’ve been really useful to unlock a specific door to make a quick escape, but because I’d only unlocked advanced lockpicking for Evie – who was unavailable – I had to take a longer, more hazardous route out of the building.   Ah, London… in 1868, it was a bustling, heavily industrialised city, the heart of an unprecedented Empire. It feels like a different type of place to those Assassin’s Creed has visited in the past. The churches of Rome and Paris give way to London’s glistening train stations and infernal factories, its cathedrals to industry and progress. It’s not an exact replica – the map is nipped and tucked, bringing some landmarks closer together – but on the whole it feels like London, especially key areas like Trafalgar Square and the Palace of Westminster.   Watch our comparison between in-game London and the real city above. At first, I thought it was fairly ugly – a smear of brown and grey – but it slowly yields its charms. The slums are caked in mud and thousands of chimneys spew forth thick black smoke, but there’s a kind of beauty when you see it blot the sky at dusk. Similarly, walking around the foggy streets of central London by gaslight is wonderfully atmospheric. And after Unity's troubled release, it's worth stating I encountered no noteworthy bugs or performance issues.  It feels like you’re chipping away at the enemy, clawing back parts of the city. But London is also well-represented in a mechanical sense. Jacob’s effort to free the city from the Templars who control it is accomplished by slowly building up a gang, known as the Rooks, by deposing small-time Templars who control various districts within the seven boroughs. Most of the activities in the open-world, outside of side quests, contribute towards this goal, and as a consequence a lot of the optional activities feel more meaningful and less like filler. It feels like you’re chipping away at the enemy, clawing back parts of the city. Similarly, you can stifle the enemy in other ways, like bribing the police or controlling the docks. Admittedly, these gang upgrades are simply purchased through a sterile menu, but they convey the notion of the 19th-century city as a complex organism. The campaign missions achieve something similar, with each target occupying a slightly different sphere of influence, including the worlds of science, politics, and finance. Even though it positions the devious Crawford Starrick behind everything, it effectively conveys the idea of corruption and control being diffused across different systems.   It all sounds rather serious, but Syndicate is also the silliest Assassin’s instalment in quite some time. It shows a real delight in ransacking its rich Victorian setting for fun stuff to do. There are so many amusing missions, from tracking down hallucinogenic orchids for Charles Darwin to retrieving the lapdog of Benjamin Disraeli’s wife in the Devil’s Acre, the most dangerous part of London. Early on, you can dress up Jacob as Sherlock Holmes, don Cthulhu-inspired tentacular brass knuckles, and hunt down occultists with Charles Dickens. What’s not to love about that sentence?   The Charles Dickens side-missions are definitely my favourites. You accompany the great novelist to expose fraudsters, catch hypnotists, visit the most haunted house in London, and even have a supernatural encounter of your own. It’s Syndicate at its most consistently engaging, eccentric, and playful, which makes the terrible ending all the more baffling. What were they thinking? It’s entirely at odds with what the story has been about, mired in the dense, po-faced lore it spends the best part of 25 hours trying its best to forget about.   Inside the mostly entertaining and lively packaging, however, what you’re being asked to do feels very familiar. Missions almost always involve the traditional Assassin’s Creed staples of following, escorting, or killing people and/or stealing items, but Syndicate’s characters and situations do more than enough to stave off boredom. The most prominent new mechanic is the grapple-gun, and on the whole, it’s well implemented and fun to use. Its ratcheting mechanism prevents you from turning into Batman; it’s not possible to zip around London at high speed or glide, but it allows you get negotiate wider roads without coming down to street level, and reach London’s higher rooftops with ease. When you’re on the ground, carriages can be stolen at any time, and provide a helpful way to cover more ground since London’s a big place, around a third bigger than Unity’s take on Paris. They don’t feel particularly fast or exciting to drive, but they handle much better than I was expecting.   Watch us go on a horse rampage in Assassin's Creed Syndicate above. The latest iteration of Assassin’s Creed combat, on the other hand, looks fast-paced and attractive – the sword cane became a favourite, thanks to its delightfully brutal finishers – but got a touch repetitive by the time I was through. It would also be nice to have more non-lethal ways to subdue others, especially in a setting that introduces the police as a hostile but ultimately well-meaning obstacle that I didn’t feel good about having to kill. Technology dominates the era, but Alexander Graham-Bell – the era’s Da Vinci – doesn’t have much to offer your arsenal outside of an electrical grenade which is effective at incapacitating large groups of enemies but draws far too much attention. And if you’re wondering if this is the year when Assassin’s Creed finally fixes its long-standing problems with your character accidentally grabbing the wrong ledge or climbing the wrong wall, it sadly has not. But free-running as good here as it’s ever been. Assassin’s Creed Syndicate is the most fun I’ve had with an Assassin’s game since Black Flag. In fact, I liked it more. Apart from its ill-fitting conclusion, it never takes itself too seriously and delights in the rich possibilities of its Victorian setting and great new grapple gun. As you explore its contrasting boroughs, you glean some sense of what powered this great city in the 19th century. The story missions capitalise on this by exploring different spheres of influence, which when combined with elements like mass transit, heavy industry, and law enforcement, make this feel like a different type of city than has been featured in the series to date. Best of all, Syndicate asks you to take London back in a way puts the last few games to shame.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	 Life Is Strange seems unsure how to resolve its up-and-down emotional journey through the hardest point in protagonist Max Caulfield’s life. By Episode 5, Max is a changed person, hardened and frantically fighting for what she believes in, no matter the cost. The final episode, Polarized, puts her through a traumatizing gauntlet. The harrowing events of Episode 4 leave her captive and grieving, and the series finale capitalizes on her desperation with catastrophic results. The unpredictability and danger of her time-rewinding power not only throws Max into undesirable timelines, it also begins to break her in ways that made my heart ache in good and bad ways. Guilting text messages from a dog and a dead girl haunt her bizarre nightmares, which involve both an infuriating and out-of-place instant-fail stealth sequence and terrific moments of empathy for certain characters. I’m confused about what this series wants to be, but I appreciate a lot about what it had to say about friendship, sacrifice, and remaking the past. Polarized cleverly recaps the entire series, digging deep into Max’s psychological state as a result, by allowing you to relive it from new perspectives. Experiencing a huge moment from her childhood as a tiny Max sitting inside a snow globe is a trip -- seeing yourself as a sad giant cuts deep.  The tone, more than ever, swings wildly in Episode 5. What I enjoyed most from Life Is Strange is its grounded human drama, feel-good friendship and feel-bad family drama conveyed extraordinarily. Those moments are great in Episode 5, and even presented in brilliant ways.  Max Caulfield’s story feels like two incompatible pieces sloppily sewn together... I really enjoyed Max remembering the best and worst points of her life while exploring her own mind, in particular. But when a scene turns suddenly from relatable issues to harsh negativity, Polarized suddenly feels like an episode from a different series. This stands out most with the cartoonish psychopath villain of Episode 5, whose dialogue with Max is almost entirely terrible “reveal the master plan” exposition and “you’ll never get away with this” cliches. Max Caulfield’s story feels like two incompatible pieces sloppily sewn together, with moments of gut-wrenching greatness thrown in the middle. Each of the episode’s two endings — chosen independently from any previous decision or world state you’ve made — feel polarized themselves, like two separate conclusions to separate stories sharing only a similar theme. Episode 5 spends a good amount of time nudging you toward one over the other, suggesting this is what it’s all been for — and it works. It’s a heartfelt, evocative, and long epilogue that ties up loose ends, perhaps a little conveniently, and sees Max learning a valuable lesson about living her life. On the other hand, the more selfish ending option leads to a brief, unsatisfying, and unhappy ending that pretends to be optimistic. It feels cheap and unfair given the massive number of meaningful choices that led to it. Click for all episode reviews of the game Life is Strange. Life Is Strange — Episode 5: Polarized is a fascinating exploration of a teenager deeply affected by loss, trauma, suffering, and failure. This is not the coming-of-age story Life Is Strange pretended to be early on, though. Polarized is destructive, unquestionably the bleak climax of the murder mystery that’s been dormant during most episodes, and it only somewhat works by the time Max Caulfield arrives to her ending. It’s disappointing to see Life Is Strange lean into its angrier story threads to complete its otherwise-touching human story, but its emotional closure and character resolutions make this a more memorable ending than its unnecessarily dark plot twists.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	" When I wrote my original review for the PC version of Wasteland 2 a little over a year ago, I gave it an 8.4 for “Great” and had this to say about it:   ""Wasteland 2 might not be the prettiest CRPG to hit digital shelves this year, but it captures the harsh hypothetical realities of the post-apocalyptic American Southwest with excellent writing, decisions with terrifying consequences, and background voice work that reinforce the human suffering that results from them. It's a game about the power of choices, and the few remaining glitches and issues with its combat do little to diminish its power.""   I recommend you read the full Wasteland 2 review to get a clear sense of what makes it a great game; this review will focus on what’s new and different in the Director’s Cut version, which moves the action over to the Xbox One and PlayStation 4. The Director’s Cut bulges with new voice acting, new graphical upgrades, and gameplay modifications in the form of perks and traits. The formerly prevalent bugs and glitches are now as common as hope for the return of contemporary society in the grim, post-apocalyptic tale developer inXile weaves for us — which is to say not at all. In some cases, that means I got to witness content I missed the first time around. In a back room in the town of Highpool, for instance, I winced as I started an event that gave me my first big dose of trouble during last year's playthrough. Here, however, it played out with all the alarms and angry bellows of goons I was supposed to hear.   Controls are all wonderfully intuitive, and it helps keep the action moving at a brisk rate. I'm also impressed with how well inXile handled the transition to gamepad-based play. It particularly performs well when applying character skills such as lockpicking and safecracking to environmental objects. All you need to do is walk up to a safe or locked strongbox, pull the left trigger, and select the appropriate action from a skill wheel. The character with the proper ability will then announce that they'll take a shot at it or somesuch, and boom, hopefully you’ve got some new goods. The right trigger handles combat abilities in a similar fashion, allowing you to reload or activate a skill like rapid fire with minimal effort. It's all wonderfully intuitive, and it helps keep the action moving at a brisk rate. Navigating party inventory is similarly simple, as it merely requires cycling through the various rangers in your party with the left and right bumpers and transferring items with a click of the X button. The one drawback of all this is that sometimes the AI pathfinding falls short. It's generally not that much of a problem, but early on there's a segment with explosions that forced me to rely heavily on the ""wait"" command for most of my party members while my lead ranger scouted things out.   I'm much less in love with the ""complete visual overhaul"" the Director's Cut brings. Comparing the two versions side by side, it's easy to see that inXile remade each level down to the smallest detail, introducing new textures and populating formerly sparse maps with additional environmental objects. The catch is that most of the time the Director's Cut merely looks different and not necessarily better. I'm thinking, for instance, of a decrepit trailer found early in the game, where a merchant named Wormy Jim cautiously hawks his wares. The rocks and trees surrounding his home look more real now, as a result of the shift the the Unity 5.0 engine. The ground around him is parched and sandy in this release, with asocial clumps out grass scattered about rather than the green blanket found in the original. It's a step up, no doubt, but I admit I wouldn't have noticed anything was different had I not taken the time to compare the two. That extends to the character models, which may outshine their 2014 predecessors in detail by still look simple and muddy up close. For all the work that's been done, Wasteland 2 still looks like a game that's from several years ago.  Elsewhere, I found myself wondering if anyone at inXile had tested the console versions in anything resembling a living room. I normally play my console games on a recliner that's a mere five feet from my television (sorry, Mom), and even at that distance I had to hunch over to read Wasteland 2's dialog choices and and the dot-matrix printout recounting my past actions. My neck still hurts from hours of doing that, and to my knowledge, there's no way to make the in-game text larger.  Director's Cut includes what feels like hours of new, high-quality voice work. The saving grace is that the Director's Cut includes what feels like hours of new voice work to add some punch to lines that were once only ""spoken"" on the readout, and they maintain original's rather surprisingly high-quality voice acting without. All the same, that still doesn't help much when you're digging through your inventory and trying to read the tooltips.   I said last year that Wasteland 2's turn-based combat tends to devolve into weary monotony after a few hours of play, and that tendency remains. With the Director's Cut, though, some new options provide some necessary variety. In a nod to the Fallout games the original Wasteland paved the way for, ""Precision Strikes"" now allow you to take shots at specific body parts for a better chance of a critical hit. That's a good thing, since even the easiest mode often involves a tedious juggle of weapon jams and misses, and any way of lessening that pain can only be a plus. (I will admit, though, that I chiefly used it during encounters where ammo was scarce or at least one of my party members was at death's door.)   Also adding to the fun is a new, extensive set of ""quirks"" in the character creator. Also adding to the fun is a new, extensive set of ""quirks"" in the character creator that bestow amazing bonuses at the cost of some crippling weaknesses (much like old-school Fallout’s perks). There's the appropriately named ""Asshole"" quirk, for instance, which ensures that every Hard Ass dialogue option succeeds while sacrificing all ""Kiss Ass"" and ""Smart Ass"" options. There's ""Unlucky,"" which causes a ranger to shoot out a random, powerful lightning bolt that can hit either friend or foe. One of my favorites is ""Manic Depressive,"" which adds or subtracts a point to attributes with every level gain. Mood swings, you know. Perks enrich the gameplay further, allowing bonuses to everything from armor and carry weight to reduced explosion damage as you level. All of this translates into a game that maintains the elements that made the original release so memorable while seasoning it with a touch of spice. The quirks and perks soften the edges of the rougher parts of Wasteland 2's combat, as do a few smarter arrangements for enemy encounters. Much as with the graphics, they're not so groundbreaking that they slap you with the sheer force of their improvements; instead, they're worked in so subtly that I sometimes only knew something was different after realizing that I was having more fun than I'd had at the same point last year. The trouble with these kinds of improvements is that they're not strong enough to warrant a replay if you've already finished the game, but taken together, they easily render the Director's Cut the version to play if you've never picked it up before. The focus here is on the quality of life; a way of bringing a touch of green to the barren areas of the original design. While the core experience remains much the same, inXile's work here affects everything, and generally for the better. Wasteland 2: Director's Cut presents much the same experience that impressed us last year, but here it's given a facelift that affects everything from its graphics to hours of new voiceover files. While echoes of the original release pacing problems remain, the Director's Cut does much to add variety to the experience with new features such as perks, quirks, and precision aiming. It's likely not enough to warrant a replay if you've already finished it, but if this is your first foray into inXile's bleak vision of the future, this is the best place to start off."
Justin Davis	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/minecraft-story-mode-episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone-review	 Episode 1 of Minecraft: Story Mode feels more like Telltale’s The Walking Dead than you might guess. You’ll make tough choices about which members of your group stay and which go, mediate disputes, and yes, you’ll even fend off zombies. Of course, Story Mode’s family-friendly adventure replaces Walking Dead’s despair with a lighthearted sense of humor and camaraderie, written with a lot of heart that kept me invested in this story and its mysteries. At first, the world is a mystery in of itself. We play as Jesse, the heart of a group of friends and aspiring builders. As for what it means to be a builder in the world of Minecraft: Story Mode? I couldn’t tell you, because almost no time is spent on introducing us to Telltale’s take on Minecraft’s inherently blank-slate universe in Episode 1. Instead we’re quickly tossed directly into the drama. Ten extra minutes of opening scenes devoted to who these friends are, where they live, and other worldbuilding or character moments would have gone a long way towards orienting me into what this blocky world is all about and what its rules are. Are they kids? Adults? Do people in this world have jobs? I’m not sure.   These concerns fade into the background once the compelling world-ending plot kicks into high gear. The themes might be heavy - death! destruction! betrayal! - but it’s all presented in more of a light, Ghostbusters-esque vibe. Jesse, faultlessly voiced by actor/comedian Patton Oswalt if you play as a male or Catherine Taber as female, perfectly balances heroics with laughs. The rest of the squad isn’t given enough screen time to grow beyond one-dimensional status, sadly. The episode’s heaviest moment comes when your group makes a discovery that forces them to question everything they’ve always believed in. Pretty heavy stuff, for a game mostly content to get by on laughs.  Big Minecraft fans will enjoy it on a much deeper level. Telltale’s commitment to genuinely forking paths more than ever before is off to an impressive start. On my episode-closing stats screen I found out that only 29% of players had experienced a rescue sequence I assumed was mandatory. The episode ends on a heavy choice, too. Allowing me to truly navigate my own path through this adventure feels great, and does make up for some of Story Mode’s storytelling shortcomings. Minecraft: Story Mode will work as a traditional “save the world!” adventure for just about anyone, but big Minecraft fans will be able to enjoy it on a much deeper level. Cute in-jokes like punching trees as part of a training montage, gathering nine slime to craft a slime block, and admiring a chicken-torturing device made the Minecraft fan in me smile. I especially liked the couple of time-lapse building sequences that show elaborate structures being erected, and the opportunity to “craft” story-critical items by placing them directly onto a crafting table.   Even more impressive is Story Mode’s gorgeous in-game sets. Each looks like it was painstakingly and lovingly created directly in Minecraft itself. It’s extremely authentic and impressive, with lots of huge buildings and vistas to soak in, combined with plenty of tiny street-level details when wandering around town. Still, I wish there was more to play around with in these spaces. Minecraft’s trademark is its unrestricted freedom and interactivity, yet Story Mode Episode 1 only contains a couple true puzzles. Those that are here really work, though. They’re smartly integrated into the plot and environment, and feature clever solutions. But that isn’t enough gameplay to sustain a two-hour episode, the rest of which is made up mostly of on-rails quick time events. Minecraft: Story Mode is a pleasant, family-friendly adventure that very quickly won me over and kept me invested in its twists and turns. The drama might not be as heightened as something like The Walking Dead, but I still found myself surprisingly invested in the choices I had to make about my companions, undeveloped as they may be, and smiling at the Minecrafty in-jokes. Sparse interactivity and a lack of commitment to explaining this world and its inhabitants hold Episode 1 back, but I’m still absorbed in my story, and eager to find out what happens next.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	 The Witcher 3: Hearts of Stone introduces its intriguing antagonist Olgierd von Everec by having him insightfully critique a stone sculpture of a famous artist, only to tip it over and watch it shatter to pieces. It’s a great introduction to a great character, but it also serves as a thematic jumping-off point for this excellent DLC chapter. Hearts of Stone is about taking the stoic, stone-like wall Geralt has always presented to his compatriots and to us, and bringing it crumbling down. The result is a Geralt quite unlike the one we’re used to, and one of the warmest, most human story threads in all of the Witcher 3.  Hearts of Stone does everything right on the gameplay side of things. Arachnomorphs, the new enemy type, are a blast to fight. They have the mobility to keep their distance from Geralt until they can web you from afar and engage on their terms, and if you try to disable and focus down one of them, the rest will swarm in to protect their own. This same sophistication can be seen in the bosses you’ll fight during your 10 to 15-hour journey. From a giant, mutated, poison-spewing toad to the tornado conjuring Ofieri Sand Mage, all the new enemies introduced in Hearts of Stone put up more interesting fights than most of what was found in The Wild Hunt.   Hearts of Stone opens up and populates the northeastern part of the Novigrad map with a bunch more little towns and areas to explore. It looks and feels very much like the rest of what The Witcher 3 offers, but hey, that’s just more of an excellent thing.  All of it is of such high quality that I often had trouble discerning whether something was new, or just something I’d never done my first time through. So while it doesn’t stand out as uniquely different, nothing in Hearts of Stone feels like it was rushed out by some sort of “B team.” As ever, the plentiful sidequests all have fun, interesting stories to tell. Runewords actually alter or break the normal rules of combat in ways that changed how I played.  One of those stories is of an Ofieri merchant who waxes poetic about the beauty of his far-off homeland. He also introduces the new Runewords mechanic, which allows you to apply powerful, unique buffs to your gear by combining three existing runes. More than straight-line stat upgrades, these actually alter or break the normal rules of combat in ways that changed how I played. I went for one that granted a huge boost to health and stamina regen once I hit max adrenaline, and immediately switched my build around to focus on generating adrenaline so I could go mad with power once the runeword kicked in. Things get even more interesting than that though. One in particular makes all of your equipped armor count as heavy, allowing you to make use of the School of the Bear passive while wearing whatever you want. Another cause your Axii sign to skip to another target if the current one dies. Not only are these changes functional and cool to mess with, but they have the nice side effect of giving runes value beyond their standard stats. All those junk runes sitting in your inventory now have the potential to turn into something useful. Additionally, the Runewright can add sockets to any piece of gear for a cost, finally giving us a reliable way to socket our favorite pieces of gear.   But the true star of Hearts of Stone is the story, which finds believable ways to put Geralt into new situations you wouldn’t expect to see him in, like making a speech at a wedding, or willfully working with others to plan a heist. It introduces great new characters like von Everec, and breathes new life into the enigmatic Gaunter O’Dimm and Shani, who some might remember from the first Witcher game.  The complex nature of the relationship between Gaunter, Olgierd, and Geralt is drawn beautifully, with nuanced performances of material that’s more introspective and thematically driven than anything else. Missed chances at love, the institution of marriage, learning to live for the moment, the illusion of free will - these are explored to varying degrees, making it one of my favorite Witcher 3 storylines. The story in Hearts of Stone alone would make it worth getting, but it succeeds on other levels as well. The fun new enemies and bosses, along with the customization potential of Runewords make Hearts of Stone a very well-rounded package that shouldn’t be skipped.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	 Just 10 minutes into Transformers: Devastation I’m in a fistfight with the monstrous Devastator. This and other epic boss battles are lovingly authentic to the ‘80s Transformers TV show and movie, right down to the original voice actors and rocking power ballad wailing in the background. But the appeal of this Transformers game isn’t solely pre-Michael Bay nostalgia: Devastation does a good job of transforming my favorite robots in disguise into a fun and energetic action game.   The polished cell-shaded look of these Generation One Autobots and Decepticons is amazing, with textures and animations that feel ripped right out of the 1986 movie. I could watch the detailed sequence where Optimus Prime changes into a big rig truck all day. Devastation nails the presentation angle, with colorful graphics that effectively capture the sights and sound of a decades-old cartoon adventure. The level of obsessive detail for everything Transformers is impressive, from the shiny metallic finish on each robot body down to the family station wagons and blocky cabs of the time sitting on the road. But the deeper I went into the story, the bland arenas and levels felt more and more forgettable. It’s disappointing, because the art direction nails the atmosphere, but buildings and textures are noticeably copy-and-pasted, to the point that I would have gotten lost without the in-game map telling me I hadn’t already been here. Devastation’s combat is deep enough to keep me hooked, and its boss fights and tough-as-nails difficulty put me through a gauntlet of vicious Decepti-creeps. The enemies fall into predictable generic robot types, but PlatinumGames does a good job of making them an intimidating threat on the battlefield. I quickly learned not to write- off a pack of the blandly designed fodder ground soldiers, because they can end your good-guy robot campaign pretty quickly. The difficult bosses are no slouches either, forcing you to fight carefully and efficiently or end up in the scrap heap.  Still, the nostalgia card is well-played, but this isn’t exactly Transformers the way your remember it because PlatinumGames introduces some exciting energy to the combat. I’ve never seen the Autobots fight the way they do in Devastation’s six-hour campaign. The high-octane action is a rad, over-the-top direction, where Cybertronian warriors can unleash blistering combos. You can take any of the five playable Autobots (Optimus Prime, Bumblebee, Grimlock, Sideswipe, and Wheeljack) into any mission, and each is a good, distinct mix of power speed with a unique ability and fighting style that sets them apart. So while Bumblebee’s speedy melee strikes don’t do a ton of damage compared to Optimus Prime’s fierce sweeping trailer attack, his ability to link together vehicle attacks quickly makes him just as useful. Grimlock’s Dinobot moves stand out as some of the most ridiculous fun in Devastation. On top of being a an adorable robotic tyrannosaurus who runs like a duck, his primal attacks allows him to finish off an foe by clotheslining him and dragging him face-first through the ground. The high-octane action is a rad, over-the-top direction...  Of course, watching a car zip into a mid-air backflip might look ridiculous, but these vehicle burst attacks are part of a deep combo system that’s easy to learn yet complex enough to quickly switch between melee attacks, gunplay, and vehicle attack forms. I could string together attacks easily enough, but there’s also complexity in the form of animation cancelling and lengthy combo chains -- which are especially fun to pull off on towering bosses like Devastator. The robust combat system allows me to flex some creative muscle when beating up the Decepticons. Going from car-to-bot and back is part of a great core loop that never got old. What did get old were some driving sections, which try to set up exhilarating chase sequences, but ultimately fail because of poor design. Sometimes I’d overtake the boss I was chasing, only to get lost because I couldn’t quite tell where I was on these repetitive race tracks.  But the strangest oddity of Devastation is the confusing gear and stat system that adds nothing but a quagmire of useless complexity. Every level constantly doles out heaps of unsatisfying and generic gear that bumps your stats up little by little. Even when I made a weapon that felt overpowered when I landed a hit, Devastation doesn’t turn into an easy romp because of how precise combos and dodge timing have to be in order to succeed in combat. Character perks can be added through tech upgrades, like buffs to raise the likelihood of rare weapon drops or increased energy recovery. The additional techs are useful, but the random nature behind it makes acquiring them mostly a matter of luck and patience. All of this pointless fiddling is the least interesting part of what is otherwise a good action game. Transformers Devastation’s nostalgia-fueled fisticuffs are a fun way to revisit the classic TV show. Sophisticated combo-based combat delivers a fast and furious barrage of action, but the gear and perks systems left me wondering why they were there at all in a game all about over-the-top boss fights and robot dinosaur beatdowns.
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	 Fundamentals will always be the key to success on a basketball court. How well you can dribble, shoot, and play defense will always determine whether you win or lose. This continues to be the problem in NBA Live 16, where flashy presentation and interesting new game modes can only go as far as the stiff and laggy gameplay will take it.   Only the biggest names got the full face-scanning treatment ... Some Players just look a bit... off. And it is quite flashy. Building on the graphical improvements from last year, NBA Live 16 continues to look great, especially up close. Updated skin textures and better lighting makes players look more realistic, but it seems uneven – like only the biggest names got the full face-scanning treatment. The ones that did, like Lebron James and Russell Westbrook, look fantastic, but some players just look a bit... off. For example, the facial features of Anderson Varejao make him look like a completely different person. Additionally, only a few body types seem to be used for everybody, which results in some pretty inaccurate looking players. In real life, Kevin Durant is very thin and lanky, but in Live he almost looks bulky. Presentation has always been a high priority in EA Sports games, and NBA Live 16 is no different. The ESPN licence is used extremely well, giving the feeling that you’re watching a live broadcast. Lively crowds fill the realistic arenas, which were built using EA’s scanning technology, and that adds to the authenticity. Once again, the game commentary is led by Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy, with Jalen Rose handling the halftime and postgame shows. Nobody does a particularly good job, though, and Rose in particular feels completely unnatural and more like he’s reading from a script.   Sadly, the real problems with NBA Live 16 begin immediately after tip-off. To start, most players move identically to one another, with stiff, cartoony animations. It’s jarring to see such a good-looking character model move so poorly. Worse, noticeable input lag made the controls feel sluggish, which led to frustrating turnovers.  The advantages that ball handlers have over defenders is so significant, it makes playing defense feel pointless. Those sloppy turnovers are disasters, because defense in NBA Live 16 feels like an afterthought. The advantages that ball handlers have over defenders is so significant, it makes playing defense feel pointless - you’re just waiting for them to make huge mistakes. Holding L2 is supposed to help your defender lock on to the player they’re guarding, but proves ineffective since they can just run around you with little to no resistance anyways. Even players with high defensive attributes, like Iman Shumpert, continuously get beat to the hole. The demoralizing sight of my AI teammates just standing around watching the uncontested dunks became uncomfortably familiar. Since playing defense isn’t very effective or fun, a sort of shootout atmosphere emerged, where I would just let my opponent take open shots, knowing that I had to answer on the other end of the court. If a shot rims out, though, it feels like a complete crapshoot. Six-foot-tall point guards constantly out-rebound centers, and even if you’re in perfect position someone else will most likely swoop in and take the ball away.  Not every aspect of the gameplay is bad, as there have been a few significant improvements over last year’s mediocre NBA Live 15 (review). The new shot meter, for example, is a much cleaner, simpler way of shooting the ball. After releasing your shot, you’re given a percentage above the shooter’s head, which lets you know the probability of success based on how you timed your shot, as well as a small indication of any mistakes you may have made. Understanding how to shoot properly has never been more clear. Running the pick and roll works pretty well too; holding L2 calls a teammate over to set a pick, and releasing it tells him to roll towards the hoop or sit back for an open shot.    The easy to pick up and play Live Run provides short, sweet hoops fun. It’s disappointing that the core gameplay is so flawed, because there are a few game modes that really could have been special otherwise. Pro Am Live Run and Summer Circuit are prime examples: the easy to pick up and play Live Run sees 10 players facing off in a five-on-five game to 21, providing short, sweet hoops fun. Sumer Circuit, on the other hand, has more of a co-op feel, since you can group up with friends and play on various real-world basketball courts like Rucker Park and Venice Beach against AI teams of increasing difficulty. The player you use in both Pro Am modes is the same as your Rising Star, EA’s version of 2K’s MyPlayer. Rising Star returns mostly unchanged, the good and the bad. It’s still fun to take a created player from the draft to superstardom, but the scrupulous grading system in each game continues to be a drag because it encourages you to play selfishly instead of working as a team. I constantly felt punished for passing on my own open looks in favor of a teammate that had an even better position.  If you want to create a more personal experience, you have the ability to use the GameFaceHD app, which uses your phone to transfer your image into the game. While this seems like it could be cool if it worked, I was never able to make it look right, so I ended up using a preset character.  Ultimate Team is a fun way to make the most of NBA Live 16. Finally, Dynasty mode and Ultimate Team return, with few noteworthy additions. While Dynasty mode remains bare-bones and featureless, Ultimate Team is still a fun way to make the most of NBA Live 16. You can earn player cards by completing certain goals, like any of the 150+ challenges – like beating a team full of recent free agents, or a team full of sixth men. Highly rated player cards can be earned sooner this year, but the small contracts attached to said cards only let you use them a few times, making every time you use them feel exciting. New modes and features make NBA Live 16 a bit better than its predecessor, but the clumsy controls and unbalanced gameplay keeps greatness out of reach yet again. Simply put, if the gameplay doesn’t feel right in one mode, it doesn’t feel right in any of them, regardless of how clever they are or how good it looks. NBA Live still has a long way to go.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	 My wrists quickly got sore after I sat down at a Rock Band drum kit for the first time in five years – but it’s a good, familiar kind of ache. I’d forgotten how physical of an experience the rock-n’-roll simulator can be, and also just how much fun nailing a song like 90's favorite Live's “All Over You” sends coursing through my body. Rock Band 4 is no-frills relative to its predecessors – it has no online play, no keyboards, and no secondary modes like Practice or Score Duel – but it also makes smart decisions, resulting in the best overall music-game experience yet.   Firing up Rock Band 4 is an experience that’s almost identical to the first three games Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It’s a deceptively simple concept that, through the power of working as a team and some great music, becomes much more fun than tapping four colored buttons on plastic instruments in time with corresponding note gems as they scroll down the screen has any right to be. With Rock Band, it’s often more about the journey of pretending to rock out together than the destination of a high score.  Developer Harmonix’s decision to pick up where it left off last generation rather than reinvent itself in any significant way, then, gives you the same feeling as a new AC/DC album: familiar, in that it hits all the same notes that made it famous, but also safe and predictable. Innovation is largely replaced by refinement: it’s easier than ever to sign band members in and out of their own profiles, for instance, and it’s mercifully simple to individually change difficulties on the fly when you get stuck on a tough song like Dream Theater’s merciless “Metropolis, Pt. 1: The Miracle and the Sleeper.” The new console hardware brings quick loading times, and everything runs perfectly smooth, so you’re never more than a few moments away from rocking out and never frustrated by a missed beat. Home-theater calibration is easy, too. Once you’re up and running with a group of friends, Rock Band 4 creates an almost tangible, physical synergy in the room that everyone feeds off of. It’s almost intoxicating when it’s at its peak – for instance, when you’re all playing perfectly in synch, deploying your Overdrive power together at a key moment in a legendary song all of you know by heart in order to octuple your score.   Songs, of course, are the backbone of any Rock Band game, and that’s where Rock Band 4 is noticeably weaker out of the box than it should be. A couple of A-list gets like U2 and Van Halen headline what is the series’ weakest overall on-disc setlist, which is otherwise made up of B- and C-list acts such as The Outfield, Eddie Japan, and .38 Special. Meanwhile, the big names that are here often suffer from Rock Band having already featured their biggest hits in the past three games. Rush is back, but the song is the much lesser-known “A Passage to Bangkok.” Foo Fighters are in, albeit “Feast and the Famine” from their latest album. That’s not to say these songs aren’t fun to play – they are! – but they’re the equivalent of deep cuts on what should be a greatest-hits album.  Where are Metallica, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Nirvana, AC/DC, and other A-list acts we’ve seen in this series before? Conspicuously absent. As a result of the lack of starpower, my fellow IGN bandmates often passed the microphone around asking each other, “Anybody know this one?” (Oh, and in case you’re wondering, Jimmy Page still hasn’t loosened his iron grip on the rights to Led Zeppelin’s catalog.) What saves its catalogue is backward compatibility with nearly every DLC song (and physical instrument) released for previous Rock Bands – and if you bought it for a last-generation system, you still own it for use in Rock Band 4 at no extra cost (as long as you’re going from PS3 to PS4 or Xbox 360 to Xbox One). That’s a massive incentive for those who’ve invested in the series on old consoles. Most notably, it also means some players will come into Rock Band 4 with song catalogs that number in the many hundreds.   Conversely, Rock Band 4’s new career mode, called the Tour, is by far the series’ strongest campaign yet. Touches of humor, such as my cartoony bandmates and I getting lice from our travels in our beat-up tour van and appearing on stage bald at the next gig, mark choices that allow you to add more fans or better unlocks as you wind through the globe-hopping tour. Sometimes you’ll choose your two to six-song setlists outright during the shows within your tour, sometimes you’ll be forced to vote on them as a band (which itself can lead to friendly banter and/or playful arguments), and sometimes you’ll take virtual fan requests or be asked to perform encores. And the sets are plenty varied, featuring selections of songs usually pooled by general difficulty. Unfortunately, the 65 tunes provided on the disc simply don’t provide enough material to prevent significant repetition during your Tour. You really need extra downloadable songs to pad out your setlists.  Rock Band 4’s other significant new feature, solos, is a big win and proved popular with nearly everyone in the IGN office who has laid hands on it so far. Solos use a color-coded language to indicate where and how to play on your guitar during certain sections of songs, but within it you’re afforded full freedom – meaning you can press any notes you want and create your own licks while being rewarded rather than penalized. They’re introduced well, and thanks to a prominent and dedicated menu option, you can always come back to help understand how they work. It turns out there are several layers to them that I became more comfortable with over time. (If you don’t, you can also turn them off completely if you want.) In addition to helping add to your feeling of rocking out, I most appreciate that they finally make good gameplay use of the five smaller high frets near the body of the guitar – a promise the previous Rock Bands never delivered on. The track list that comes on the Rock Band 4 disc is a little light on memorable songs, but thanks to admirable backward compatibility with a huge DLC catalog, Rock Band 4 remains every bit the magical cooperative gaming experience the series has always been. Getting a band together in the living room to rock out creates some incredible moments of musical joy. On top of that, a new career mode injects some fun personality and decision-making, while solos let you express yourself mid-song without penalty. Rock Band still fulfills its potential to make me feel like a superstar musician and, like 65-year-old Bruce Springsteen still doing killer three-hour shows , proves that it’s still got “it.”
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/28/skylanders-superchargers-review	 It’s easy to say that this year’s Skylanders keeps things fresh with its focus on vehicles, but that would be selling it short. While the most obvious change is that Skylanders SuperChargers features a brand-new line of car toys and levels full of fast-paced, Mario Kart-esque racing, it also has some of the most visually appealing and mechanically diverse levels the series has to offer, with plenty of hidden areas to explore.   The figures are some of the best-looking Skylanders ever released. Of course, SuperChargers still centers around the increasingly saturated toy-to-life gimmick, where your physical Skylander toys and the new line of accompanying vehicles pop into the game world as soon as you place them on your portal. For the first time, these toys are actually articulated, too - the wheels on the Hot Streak land vehicle, which came in my SuperChargers starter pack, actually rolls, and the figures are some of the best-looking Skylanders ever released, meaning they double as great toys. We also see air and sea vehicles, each with totally unique in-game handling, taking you to barrel-roll through the sky and bob through the sea, usually chasing side-objectives, adding hours of gameplay variety.   The 20-or-so vehicle missions offer a lot of variety over the roughly 12 hours of gameplay, too, with tense chase sequences having you frantically dart across the back of a dragon, to three-step, weapon-based boss fights in arenas full of nasty obstacles. There are some interesting attempts at car-platforming, particularly in levels where you have to use an item to raise a jump at the right time, but the vehicle sequences blatantly try to rush you towards the end, totally forgetting about all the collectables you’ll have to miss as a result. The air and sea vehicles, which don’t come with starter packs, are optional extras – but highly recommended ones. You’re locked out of any sea or sky missions without purchasing the extra vehicles, as opposed to being locked out of levels based on Skylander’s individual elements as in previous games. This is certainly more of a positive for value-conscious people (like myself) who’d much prefer to purchase two extra vehicles than 10 extra Skylanders And those two vehicles certainly do add a lot to that experience, because there are whole sections of levels designed completely underwater or completely in the air.  Cleverly, the vehicles pair with specific types of Skylander drivers, too. If you put the right driver in the right vehicle, you get a special SuperCharged enhancement, giving both the Skylander and the vehicle aesthetic and statistical upgrades, are a pretty big help when it comes to successfully navigating the courses. There’s an abundance of shiny stuff to collect scattered throughout each of the levels to upgrade your ride with, but the customization system is very, very simple, and really only adds value to the surprisingly fun cooperative play. Vehicle co-op in Skylanders SuperChargers sees one player controlling the car, and another in charge of the weapons in high-speed, chaotic action. All of the single player missions can be played co-op, too, but some of the item-based puzzles can be difficult when two people jump to use those items at the same time, and cancel each other out by doing so. It also gets a little frustrating when the fixed camera makes it a little hard for both players to see exactly what they’d like to.  There’s a surprising diversity of enemies, though almost all can be approached in the exact same way. Single-player combat outside of the vehicle missions will feel familiar to anyone who has played a previous Skylanders - or Diablo, for that matter. It’s extremely forgiving, and even on the “nightmare” difficulty it doesn’t present too much of a challenge. It seems to focus more on kid-friendly button mashing and basic skill upgrades than intensely gear-specific combat influences or combo chasing. There are enough different moves for the mashing to feel purposeful, though, if the screen exploding into glittery candies whenever something busts open or you gain a level isn’t enough excitement for you on its own. There’s also a surprising diversity of enemies and, though almost all of them can be approached in the exact same way, it should be said that they’re all beautifully animated.   In fact, the all of SuperChargers is beautifully animated, from the genuinely funny, somewhat dorky team of characters who help you along the way through its disappointingly bland story, to the oddly adorable returning villain, Kaos. Even aesthetically sinister levels are so creatively designed that the vibe of the game doesn’t often veer far from charming. One level plays around with gravity, with different hallways flipping you on different corners of your TV screen, sometimes forcing you to navigate through its various portals completely upside-down. Another has a shrink/grow ray, allowing you to change the size of obstacles - shrinking your enemies, or making things so large they topple them over. The diversity of gameplay mechanics is near constant, but consistently easy to come to terms with, making it impressive for adults but totally understandable for kids.  If that’s not enough for you, there’s also a ‘hub’ that you can loosely decorate with Legendary Items like trampolines and soccer balls, which also acts as the center for most of your missions. It houses the kart racing side-missions, a store with some admittedly pretty cute purchasable hats for your Skylander to wear around in-game, and some characters to play Skystones with. (That’s the surprisingly challenging, addictive collectable card game that has returned for the third time since its debut in Skylanders Giants.) There’s certainly no shortage of things to do in Skylanders SuperChargers, and everything you can do is highly polished, however simple it all might be. Adding three different and fun vehicles and extremely creative level designs to the series’ simple but reliably enjoyable action platforming gives Skylanders SuperChargers a healthy boost. Every level has you switching between approaches based on the vehicle you’re piloting, which is great for variety. That said, both the story and the approaches to boss fights are very predictable, and some things - like vehicle customization - are overly-simplified, even considering the young target audience.
Chris Schilling	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	 Direct free-kicks aren’t all that common in FIFA 16. But if you draw a foul just outside the 18-yard box you’ll be treated to a short cutscene where the referee will march the defensive wall back the regulation 10 yards, before putting down a line of vanishing spray. It’s true to life, and the first couple of times it’s amusing to watch. You’ll probably notice the marks remain for a short while after the kick is taken before fading away. And yet I couldn’t help but wonder if the time taken to render all that might have been better spent elsewhere. With Konami hitting a series peak with PES 2016, it’s not a good year to be obsessing over minutiae like this, especially since it seems to come at the expense of EA Sports stepping back and considering the bigger picture. If last year was a closely fought contest in this long-running rivalry, this time there’s clear daylight between the two.  It’s ironic that this should happen in a year when FIFA introduces the single most progressive feature of the two games. This year’s World Cup saw women’s football reach a much wider audience than it ever has before, and it’s heartening to see 12 international women’s teams represented here for the first time. And EA Sports hasn’t simply reskinned the men’s game; you’ll notice tangible differences when playing as women, while female players have been fully motion-captured and look authentic. I’m not convinced it’s a particularly accurate simulation of the women’s game – the quality of the football is akin to a Championship club between two teams with unusually high passing stats – but I probably enjoyed playing as the women more than the men because of these mechanical differences. Though it seems to take longer for strikers to get their shots away, and the best female players don’t quite have the close control of the superstars of the men’s game, these matches are often more dynamic, unpredictable, and exciting. The main caveat is that women’s games seem far more prone to random glitches: I got a bug that rendered one pre-match tackling exercise uncompletable, while on three separate occasions my defensive line stayed rooted to the edge of the 18-yard box, leaving me with little support going forward. FIFA is a little snappier than it has been of late – it doesn’t take as long to release a pass Part of the reason the women’s game showcases FIFA at its best is because the player skill level isn’t quite so high, and thus the occasional heavy touch or mistake means it’s easier to regain possession. In the men’s game, you can go several in-game minutes without coming close to touching the ball. When you’re in control, FIFA is a little snappier than it has been of late – it doesn’t take as long to release a pass, and you’re more likely to get a shot away before a defender steps in with a last-ditch challenge. And yet when you don’t have the ball, it feels more than ever like a non-contact sport. If sliding tackles are a little overpowered in PES, they’re barely usable here; instead, you’re best kiting attackers towards other defenders or the touchline, and hoping they either misplace a pass or take a heavy touch so you can step in with a standing tackle. Even Martin Tyler  - whose commentary is more seamless and varied than ever this year - was moved to sympathise after one particularly lengthy period out of possession: “It must be so frustrating - they just can’t get the ball back.” Touché, Mr. Tyler. Referees will blow up for the mildest of collisions, but that’s understandable: otherwise you’d never get a free-kick. Other changes are rather more superficial. I’m sure the cameramen that patrol the sidelines are a new addition, or they’re certainly more prominent than I recall. This year, you can run towards them after scoring to prompt a new celebration.Andthere’s a bizarre new feature that sees Tyler pass over to a hopelessly wooden Alan McInally, who’ll report goals coming in from other matches. It’s unclear whether these goals are drawn from online games being played simultaneously, or are simply invented as part of the illusion that you’re taking part in a kind of interactive Sky Sports broadcast, but either way they’re an unnecessary distraction. And it’s a pity no one saw fit to take out Alan Smith’s immersion-shattering reminders of his ability to recognise exactly where the ball entered the net.  Meanwhile, the on-pitch irritations pile up. It’s almost impossible to whip in a cross unless you drill it along the ground; any airborne balls invariably float into the box, sucked towards the heads of defenders like a tractor beam (unless you’re the defending team, of course). Automated player selection seems more capricious than ever: I stared in disbelief as my winger ran to nod in a rare successful cross, only to leave it as control inexplicably switched to my striker five yards further back. If the new drilled pass seems to be a smart addition to your attacking arsenal, it’s a double-edged sword, since a regular pass will now trundle towards its intended target. Only the new no-touch dribble, which can be modified into a larger feint, is a total success, allowing you to commit rash defenders to a challenge before accelerating away. Shots are more dynamic and unpredictable, but it’s inordinately frustrating to patiently work an opening only for your striker to miss a presentable opportunity through random happenstance. Goalkeepers are excellent, though regular shots seem magnetically drawn to their gloves, and parries fall suspiciously often to the nearest defender. The finesse shot feels slightly overpowered to me, but it’s undoubtedly satisfying to work the space to feather a strike into the far corner.  All these adjustments to animation, dribbling, and shooting lead to what EA is calling Moments of Magic, which feels like a misguided attempt to define something that’sbeen part of FIFA for years.  is still capable of lifting me out of my chair in surprise, delight, and raw, unrestrained joy. I wouldn’t say these moments are more frequent this time, but they’re still there, and heightened as ever by an intoxicating atmosphere. Besides the inclusion of women, if there’s one area FIFA has PES licked it’s here. It’s more than just glitz when you thunder in a strike from 25 yards off the underside of the bar and the crowd roars its approval. And when the supporters start bellowing their club’s anthem at the top of their lungs to celebrate a late, late equaliser, I defy any fan not to join in. Goalkeepers are excellent, though regular shots seem magnetically drawn to their gloves It would be wrong, too, to underestimate the allure of FIFA Ultimate Team. Konami’s MyClub has made giant strides this season, but FUT triumphs on polish and immediacy. The new FUT Draft feature condenses it beautifully: it’s a way to get into it without having to invest hours building your team. Here, you’re given a random selection of players for each position, from which you should be able to assemble a world-beating squad. You’re then asked to play four increasingly challenging games, earning coin rewards and multipliers contingent on how well you performed and the difficulty level you chose. Win them all and you’ll earn gold and premium gold packs for your regular FUT squad. It might take a while to amass the 15,000 FIFA coins for the entry fee, though you can spend real money on FIFA Points to pay your way in. Microtransactions are rarely welcome in full-price retail games, though the cost of FIFA Points is reasonable, and the value of the reward is equivalent to what many would happily have spent on new FUT packs. The complete package is as substantial as ever, and those who’ve acclimatised to FIFA’s play style in recent years will likely consider it good enough. But in the face of much stronger competition, ‘good enough’ might not actually be good enough. With its biggest rival matching its dynamism and beating it for fluidity and responsiveness, EA Sports has work to do if FIFA is to regain its title as king of the digital sport.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	 It was 4 a.m., and though my Fireteam should have stepped away from Destiny: The Taken King's fantastic endgame raid hours ago, the six-player assault kept us awake to try and stomp our way to the final boss. But a challenging co-op gauntlet isn't the only thing fueling our lust for better loot drops and great shooting – there are plenty of changes, big and small, that make Destiny a much better game. The short-but-sweet campaign, menacing Taken enemies, clever bosses, and rewarding loot system, combined with another inventive raid, have made these late-night play sessions a regular thing. This expansion is the shot in the arm that Destiny needed.  The campaign is a fun highlight, with a succinct six-hour story that kept me intrigued and invested with clever level designs, gorgeous cinematic cutscenes, and funny dialogue. Character Cayde-6 steals the show with witty one-liners, delivered with enthusiasm by actor Nathan Fillion. Major character that were underdeveloped in prior expansions are featured a more prominently. The Taken King ditches the barely-there plot of previous installments in a favor a story with a clear villain and a role for us in the conflict. I missed the storytelling when it faded back into the background again once I’d wrapped up campaign, but the volume of things to afterward do kept me too busy to complain. A revamped UI makes it easy to track tasks, and completing the many quests lines never felt like busywork because of the intelligently designed Taken enemies and boss monsters. Destiny is a game where shooting is a constant action, but each Taken brings a distinct attack style that contributes to the already excellent combat sandbox. Corrupted Psions split into copies; Taken Captains will flush you out of cover and temporarily blind you; Corrupted Goblins make other Taken temporarily invincible via an energy tether. New and different tactics like these kept me on the edge of my seat, and I continued to learn how they fight for hours after the campaign ended.  Bosses benefit from this new creative direction as well. I’d never seen anything like the Sunless Cell's tense final encounter, where you're trapped in a dimly lit arena with a deadly Darkblade as he teleports around the room to chop up your squad with a heavy axe. A few bosses that show up in the Court of Oryx are hit and miss – like Loaar, a Hive Wizard that gets momentarily fatigued each time he teleports, turning him into easy target practice – but overall, The Taken King’s bosses are memorable, complex, and nothing like the big bullet sponges we fought last year.  ...there are plenty of changes, big and small, that make Destiny a much better game.  To combat them, The Taken King expands on Guardians’ abilities by introducing a third subclass option that complements each Guardian’s existing abilities and helps round out the character classes. The new Nightstalker special ability allows Hunters to tether a group of enemies and restrict their movements so the rest of a party can line up damaging precision shots and increase their DPS. This support-style ability is a first for the class and a great addition to their ability to be team players, since Hunters have until now never benefited anyone else in the Fireteam. Titans and Warlocks get their own impressive abilities: Sunbreaker Titans can toss a special mid-range Hammer to unleash a fierce barrage of strikes, and the Warlock’s Stormcaller ability blasts out a powerful discharge that’s great if you need to trim down a mob of enemies. The different combinations of abilities keep Destiny’s combat highly mobile and powerful, setting up opportunities to unleash more attacks quickly and higher DPS against enemies or bosses.  When the fights are over, we’re showered with lots of useful rewards, which fixes one of my biggest complaints about Destiny’s initially stingy loot system. It’s a generous approach that will prepare you for endgame activities like the raid or the Nightfall Strike. I also like how I don't have to immediately give up on high-level weapons or gear because another item has better stats - the infusion system lets you dismantle new items to reinforce your favorite items and keep them useful much longer. Destiny pulls the plug on upgrading your hard-earned weapons and armor, but the rate loot drops is much improved. I constantly had interesting item choices without feeling overwhelmed. The Taken King is fun a solo game, but it's a much better co-operative one that rewards you for you working with friends or strangers. In some cases, you'll need all the help you can get, like when you’re deep in the Dreadnaught warship. This labyrinth vessel that hovers near Saturn is a major location, where crowd-sourced knowledge of how to decipher hidden mechanisms to unlock chests and defeat bosses is essential.  The endgame raid, King's Fall, requires teaming up with five friends to play, which highlights Destiny’s ongoing lack of matchmaking tools. But once you organize, it’s the single best piece of The Taken King expansion. It trumps Destiny’s prior raids, Vault of Glass and Crota’s End, handily in terms of open space and tightly tuned teamwork, but the real surprise for me was the way it uses impressive scale, unique puzzles, and difficult bosses to craft a one-of-a-kind multiplayer shooter experience that’s best had without spoilers. Destiny: The Taken King is an awesome upgrade that's addressed most of my biggest problems with Destiny over the past year. The rewarding loot system, fun enemies, new subclasses, and many quests have kept me busy long after the strong story missions ended. The crown jewel is King's Fall, a demanding high-level activity that, despite the strict six-person requirement, will keep me playing into the late hours of the night.
Seth G. Macy	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	" After last year’s disappointingly shallow NHL 15, it warms my heart to see NHL 16 make major strides toward a comeback. Salvaging the previous game’s already strong and exciting fundamental hockey simulation and great looks and combining them with tons of expansive modes for both long-time fans and newcomers, this year is a return to form in the most important ways, other than its still-unreliable online play.   Replays are almost indistinguishable from broadcast hockey. The hockey game presented here has all the speed, hits, and excitement of the real deal. The action on the ice is fast and fluid, and the controls feel responsive and accurate. Spotting a hole in the defense and exploiting it for a goal never failed to lift me off my seat, fist-pumping like a crazy person. The whole thing looks and feels so much like the real thing that replays are almost indistinguishable from broadcasts, with scratches on the ice, reflections on players' helmets, and team mascots whipping the virtual crowds into a frenzy all working wonderfully to put me in the game. However, as real as it looks, there are times when the framerate simply chugs; thankfully that’s usually limited to off-ice intros and fan reactions, but it's really jarring given how good everything on the ice looks.   Most of those good looks and underlying gameplay carries over from NHL 15, which is a pretty hockey game with very little to extend its appeal beyond one-off games. This time, the list of modes and play options available in NHL 16 makes it feel like a worthy successor to the hockey games of years past. Modes like Season Mode, EA Sports Hockey League, and Online Team play have returned, and there's a lot of fun to be had in taking your hometown team from the season opener all the way through to the playoffs. Of course, the hockey season is long – one of the longest in professional sports – so if you don't feel like putting in the time to play an entire season, jumping right into playoff mode is also an option. You can play (or simulate) your way to the Stanley Cup without needing to play the staggering 82 games in the regular season. For me, the only reason I’d want to skip games would be to avoid having to hear the same repetitious Doc Emrick, Eddie Olczyk, and Ray Ferraro commentating lines over and over again.  Hockey Ultimate Team is back, and this year you can play a single-player season with your pros. There are still missing modes (I can’t help but miss the great NHL ‘94 mode that was apparently a one-time anniversary thing for NHL 14) and features (no custom soundtrack?) but improvements to returning modes help take the sting out it. For instance, Hockey Ultimate Team is back, and this year you can play a single-player season with your pros. That means you can adjust and practice crafting your team over a season before letting it loose in online play or playing against a friend.   However, NHL 16 has also done something sports games tend to overlook: it goes out of its way to accommodate newcomers to the series and introduce them to its intimidating control language that long-time series fans take for granted. Not only has practice mode returned to a form that can be considered useful (its predecessor had pared it down to just a skater-versus-goalie mode) but its other addition, the On-Ice Trainer, has made NHL 16 into something anyone with familiarity with a controller can pick up and begin to play.   On-Ice Trainer really helps make sense of NHL 16’s shooting system. Turning on the On-Ice Trainer puts control suggestions above the head of the player you're controlling. When it's semi-transparent, the trainer is giving you a suggestion on what you should be preparing to do; when the suggestion is fully opaque, that's the trainer telling you to check or pass or shoot right now. And there are visual cues built in to help you understand where your pass or shot will land. A smart system is in place for teaching you to make shots: a matrix appears in the net, showing you what parts of the goal are open for the puck, and what parts are blocked by the goalie. Aiming with the left stick, you can get a feel for where and how to shoot to maximize your potential for goals. It really helps make sense of NHL 16’s shooting system. Helping further are the tips shown between periods and after every game. You're given a grade based on how well you've performed on the ice, and the ""coach"" gives you tips and advice. But at the same time, it could be more helpful with its constructive criticism. For instance, I was chided for losing faceoffs and the suggestion was for me to adopt a backhand grip without actually telling me how to do that.   But whether you know how to play EA’s hockey games already or not, NHL 16's main weakness is its online play. I played during the EA Access weekend on Xbox One, and on PS4 with a handful of other players, (both on a hard-wired connection to my modem) and I was unable to play an entire game on either platform without some sort of disruptive lag or stutter. Online Shoot-Out mode was similarly frustrating, because while match-finding and connection times were admirable, the connection issues were so bad that I could never confidently tell you if I scored due to my skill or because my opponent saw my avatar deke when I was actually shooting. With so many modes in NHL 16 being online enabled, this really presents a problem if you don’t have another hockey fan next to you. When played by yourself or with a friend on the couch, NHL 16 is a fast, sharp-looking, and fun hockey sim that (unlike last year’s game) includes enough modes to keep veterans happy while doing an admirable job of welcoming newcomers as well. It still suffers technical problems with online play, which is a shame, because outside of noticeably repetitious play-by-play calling and some non-gameplay-affecting framerate issues in cutscenes and replays, NHL 16 is an otherwise excellent game."
Nathan Lawrence	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/rugby-league-live-3-review	 When developer Big Ant Studios makes a sports simulator, it really takes the term ‘simulator’ seriously. Anyone familiar with Big Ant’s most recent sports simulator, Don Bradman Cricket, will know the developer prides itself on digitising as many facets of the real-life sport as possible. Rugby League Live 3 is certainly no exception to this. That’s also one of the initial hurdles to overcome. Like Don Bradman Cricket, Big Ant has little interest in holding the player’s hand. While there is some assisted training in Rugby League Live 3 by way of drills, these are limited to goal kicking, passing, tackling, and play-making. These drills are gamified to the point where they’re more enticing for seasoned (or returning) players, rather than those learning the game mechanics for the first time. If you’re unfamiliar with the specific rules of rugby league, Rugby League Live 3 won’t teach you. Early on, most of my training came from tabbing through the loading screen tips. There is a so-called training mode within the drills that can be toggled on or off, but the on-screen prompts are unfittingly matched with a slow-motion system that encourages bad habits more than it helps to perfect timing. Make no mistake: timing is one of the most crucial components of Rugby League Live 3. Go the Doggies, etc. It took me a few hours to discover the best training was hidden in the help menu, albeit in static form. Clicking through dozens of screens helped me wrap my head around new tactics and possibilities that weren’t covered anywhere else. Before stumbling on these tips, I was struggling to hold my own on the second-lowest difficulty level. There are five difficulty levels in total, and those searching for an arcade experience will find the best match is the lowest one. This mode is laughably easy, as the game takes care of defensive manoeuvres, with perfectly timed automated side-steps, goosesteps and fends. It also dumbs down the opposing AI to the point that it makes you feel like a conscience-less A-grade player smashing through an Under 12s match. It’s probably the best difficulty to learn the controls, mechanics, and timing, however, creating the gameplay foundation for the offensive and defensive strategies that are essential on higher difficulties. Jump the challenge up a notch to the inaptly named Amateur level, and a lot of that handholding is out the window. From this difficulty level onwards, learning to master the right stick to avoid tacklers is essential. It becomes trickier when cycling through the many camera perspectives, as the left-stick movement controls and left/right-bumper passing shift relative to the new perspective (as they should), but the right stick functions do not. For me, this meant rewiring a natural instinct that would have preferred both sticks to be harmonious in relation to the new camera perspective. There are also a couple of other controller fumbles. Stealing the ball is one of two buttons, depending on whether you’re looking at the help menu or the control screen. In the same breath, it’s frustrating that a right-hand repositioning is sometimes required on a default controller grip, given that the right trigger controls sprinting, while right bumper handles passing to the right of your player. Worse still, the controller sporadically drops out during matches: online, it’s less of an issue because you can instantly reconnect, but for solo play, it nullifies any match contributions to XP-rewarding challenges as soon as you reconnect to the game. Hit-ups, side-steps, goosesteps and fends have specific situations when they are more effective, but they also have the downside of slowing down forward momentum. Even if you make a break, there’s no radar to indicate what defenders might be ahead of you, so sound knowledge of field positions and fast reactions are recommended to turn a break into a try. On top of this, every camera angle seems to have a distinct downside, with no one camera angle that worked effectively for spotting offensive opportunities or tracking defensive weaknesses. Steve's suggestion of holding a wheelbarrow race turned out to be a ruse. That being said, scoring a try is exactly the kind of edge-of-your-seat experience that it should be in this type of game. Individual players have meaningful personalised attributes, particularly as it relates to speed and weight, both of which are taken into account when they collide with defenders. A heavier player has a better chance of smashing through a lighter defender or, when tackling, can use that weight advantage to force a player over the sideline. Faster players come onto the ball quicker, which is perfect for sneaky passes, and these quicker footballers are your best bet at breaking through a small defensive gap before the opposing team can react. This becomes even more apparent when playing online, as both offensive and defensive AI seem to be set quite low. Defenders will often mill around and watch a human opponent fly by them, jogging backwards instead of turning to chase. When attacking, too small a gap on the blind side means a winger will flank around to the open side, which can embarrassingly result in a pass over the side line where there was a player a second before. The best tactic for winning, like the last two games in the series, is to pass the ball to your team’s fastest player and have them zigzag up the sideline. While the AI defenders watch the human-controlled attacker fly by, you’ll be frustratingly mashing the left trigger to coax the game into selecting one of the AI lugs to perform a tackle. In fairness, this auto-select option works the vast majority of the time, but it most noticeably comes apart in situations where you need it to select the player closest to the attacking player who’s about to score. On the positive front, stamina plays a big part in Rugby League Live 3, and it’s more nuanced than simply controlling how long a player can sprint. In defensive terms, low stamina impacts a player’s effectiveness when tackling and their discipline in line formation. While regularly sprinting to pick or make gaps is advised, it also comes at the risk of running players ragged to the point that when possession switches, your defensive line isn’t as effective. You can get the game to automatically substitute players for you, but it’s also well worth taking care of this manually to keep your players fresh, even in shorter matches. Speaking of which, casual matches are on offer for those seeking a quick rugby fix, complemented by bigger showdowns in the form of grand finals or a State of Origin decider, while dedicated players can start a career mode, as a coach, rookie player, or existing player. It’s worth noting that controlling an individual player in career mode further highlights the issues of relying on defensively inconsistent friendly AI players. Kick it. There are various licenced competition leagues and tournaments to play in too, and any league, team, or specific player/referee that hasn’t been covered in the release, can be downloaded in the community-created FanHub section. Even without the fan-created content, there are more than 100 teams from global rugby league comps. The presentation is strong, too. Iconic commentators Andrew “Vossy” Voss and Phil “Gus” Gould make you feel as though you’re on the pitch. The crowd roars as Vossy and Gus narrate your efforts with the kind of enthusiasm fans have come to expect, and it leads to incredible moments, from a big hit in a tackle, to a runaway try. Outside of rare instances where they get it wrong, the commentary is so diverse and on point that listening to the duo riff off each other and alternate commentary lines is as entertaining as playing the game (more so when it gets frustrating). Rugby League Live 3 is close to being a great game. It’s certainly the best rugby game on new- and last-gen systems, but its steep learning curve, lack of training, AI weirdness, and returning sins from past games hold it back. It’s a shame, because when all the pieces click into place, this can be a compelling experience.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/10/dragon-age-inquisition-trespasser-review	 The idea behind Trespasser is to provide closure for the Dragon Age: Inquisition saga after the big event that takes place at the end of the main game, and for the most part it does so successfully. In some ways, it’s modest. This final seven hours of story DLC doesn’t offer exciting loot to collect or huge environments to explore, but the story and combat left me feeling satisfied with the way things turned out for my Inquisitor and her merry band of adventures. While investigating the sudden appearance of Quanari in the Orlasian Winter Palace during delicate diplomatic hearings, I explored lost elven ruins and discovered the truth behind a creature known as Fen’Heral and its connection to elves, plus heard tales of the origins of the Veil and the old gods. All this new information does a tidy job of tying up some of Inquisition’s loose ends, and does it in the same style that’s enriched the world of Thedas for the whole Dragon Age trilogy.   That said, there were a couple of places where the story stumbles. One particular curveball involving a member of the Inquisition felt too far out of left field, and I wasn’t keen on the way dealings with the Qunari were left unresolved. I did like that I was offered a few significant choices during my dealings with haughty Thedas diplomats, however. These decisions actually affected the ending to my story in a meaningful way, and it was fun seeing how events played out after the credits rolled. Exploring the ruins revealed a nice diversity of locales in this DLC, which include a mine full of deadly explosives, a haunted library, and a lush green vale. Though you can’t go very far off the beaten path (which I didn’t mind, since lackluster loot lessoned my incentive to look for hidden areas) the frequent changes of venue prevented my journey from ever suffering from visual boredom.   Interestingly, the mix of narrow corridors and open courtyards had the added benefit of forcing me to change combat tactics frequently in battle, which kept the combat feeling just as fresh as the locations. Smashmouth tactics used by Qunari warriors and fleet-footed assassins kept me on toes, giving combat a frenzied feel that warded off repetitiveness whenever it threatened to rear its ugly head. In fact, even with two overpowered mages casting barrier and my Inquisitor wrecking enemies with an interesting new Anchor skill, I had to pause combat and reassess the situation more than once to ensure I had the advantage in battle. Even after conquering the campaign, the challenge is maintained here well. Trespasser’s greatest strength, though, is the time spent between missions with party members. Amongst the flowers and water fountains of the Winter Palace courtyard, I loved watching Cullen bond with an adorable Mabari (a faithful dog breed that was a big part of Dragon Age: Origins), relaxing at a day spa with Viviene, and collecting pages from Varric’s latest novel around the palace. The camaraderie between my party members has always been a series highlight for me, and although none of the new conversations I had with my teammates in Trespasser were among their best or most poignant, the humorous dialogue and excellent voice acting left a smile on my face.   Dragon Age: Inquisition’s tale comes to a close not with a bang, not with a whimper, but with some satisfying closure and challenging combat met with allies that’ve become close friends. Even with a few stories left unresolved and a lack of new loot to drive me to explore its relatively narrow world, it was great saying goodbye to my friends and getting a sneak peek at what might yet be ahead for the denizens of Thedas.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/08/forza-motorsport-6-review	 It’s teeming rain at Brands Hatch as my Volvo 850 Estate revs eagerly on the grid. Framed by a field of far sportier competitors the shiny red station wagon looks slightly absurd. But she’s a true sleeper car; from the outside she looks as if she ought to be packing nought but a cabin full of groceries and a back seat stuffed with squawking, snot-smothered kids but underneath she’s meanness set to music. She’s stripped of every excess kilo, turbocharged, stiffened, lowered, and converted to all-wheel-drive. Not even the fondly remembered 850 Estates of the ’94 British Touring Car Championship I built her in homage to could touch this thing. She’s not entirely unbeatable, though. In torrid conditions the best I can manage is second. But it’s moments like these where most of what’s truly great about Forza Motorsport 6 can be observed all at once. The wet weather is like nothing I’ve ever driven through in a game. The offbeat Volvo family truckster-turned-track weapon is a perfect illustration of just how charmingly far-reaching and eclectic Forza 6’s garage is, and just how heavily you can modify its cars. The glorious driving dynamics. The superb sound. The unflinching frame rate. All right here. Forza 6 is the biggest, broadest, and best Forza Motorsport game to date by a massive margin. The fastest way through a corner? Take a lion through it. Bucketing rain is Forza 6’s biggest bullet point and the effect itself is astounding. It would’ve been nice if the wet weather was able to arrive and break up dynamically (as it does in Forza Horizon 2) because it would add some tactical spice to the racing, but visually and physically it’s extremely impressive. The streaking droplets on the windscreen, which slosh under the wipers and trace left or right with cornering forces, are a big step up from Horizon 2 – far closer to the likes of Driveclub – but it’s the 3D puddles of standing water all around the tracks that really make Forza 6’s wet weather racing an unmissable experience. Hit a puddle with one side of your car at speed and it’s going to try to drag you off track, as that side slows from the drag of the water. Notice a small lake on the apex of your favourite corner? Take a wider line; you can’t steer when you’re skimming over the water’s surface like the world’s least-practical wakeboard. It’s not just slipperier; it’s like the tracks are actively trying to kill you. It makes for amazing racing, whether you’re behind a fancy wheel or content with feeling the feedback though the Xbox One controller’s criminally underrated haptic triggers. That this is all achieved with 24 cars on track and at an undaunted 60 frames-per-second is quite remarkable. Night racing is a similarly great-looking effect, from the pitch black Mulsanne Straight at Le Mans – so dark that in chase cam your car is barely visible behind the red glow of its taillights – to the artificially-lit Daytona, with every car throwing multiple shadows from multiple sources simultaneously. It’s white-knuckle stuff, with corners suddenly emerging from the ink. Very demanding and very satisfying. Like Forza 5, however, all tracks are snapshots of a certain time of day and temperature; it’s all baked-in so it can get a little samey. Shame there aren't any tracks that combine both night and rain. When it comes to curating a car roster Turn 10 is the best in the business. Forza 6’s garage of over 460 cars takes in everything from cult ’80s and ’90s performance faves to today’s bleeding-edge hypercars, from ’60s and ’70s F1 cars to race-ready machines out of the current WTCC, V8 Supercars, and IndyCar seasons, and from unrestricted Can-Am monsters to pre-war open-wheel deathtraps. It’s an incredible assortment of cars even if the game is a bit of a tease at times, mentioning things like the zany six-wheeled Tyrrell P34 during a key voiceover but not actually featuring the car. As always they’re all fully-upgradeable and primed for painting. They’re all viewable within the game’s Forzavista mode too, the look and feel of which is more or less unchanged from Forza 5. There’s also been a great refresh with how you browse the cars. Scrolling left scrubs through manufacturers and individual models are listed vertically. Very welcome considering how cumbersome it was getting in Forza 5 as more and more cars were added. I heartily recommend a year’s subscription to the Jelly of the Month club for whoever spearheaded this tweak. Can-Am have a giant wing on this? Sure can! The handling remains fantastic, and the sense of grip and weight is even more pleasing than it was in Forza 5. Engine notes remain another big highlight, particularly with a field of 24 cars standing on the throttle waiting for the green. I also particularly like how sounds seem to bounce back off parts of the environment in tighter spaces. The two-pronged career mode does a good job of putting you in a wide variety of the many cars on offer in Forza 6. The Showcase Events, which are bespoke races designed to highlight particular vehicles, racing series, or eras, are a good addition to the game. You don’t need to own the cars utilised in these races; you can just hop straight in once they’re unlocked. They’re good to cleanse the palate between the regular career races. This is where you’ll find the endurance racing, which I enjoyed in Forza 4 but was absent from Forza 5. Forza 6 features enduros for LMPs, GT cars, Indy, V8s, and others. The regular career races in Forza 6 are delivered in a more linear fashion than Forza 5, which meant I couldn’t hop straight into a racing series in the cars I wanted to race most even though I could afford one (returning players are well rewarded, depending on time spent in previous Forza games). I think the biggest sin here though is the dated top-3-or-bust progression system. It simply means your race objective never wavers; start in the middle of the grid, pass seven-or-so cars, finish on the podium. If you don’t, you need to start the race again – you can’t simply make up points later. I found myself yearning for a bit of a revamp here, perhaps inspired by the more nuanced Grid and Project CARS approach to race weekends. The new Mod system (gameplay modifiers you can apply to single-player to earn bonus credits and XP by achieving certain objectives or enduring specific handicaps) adds some zest to the career but I will admit I often found myself forgetting about it, even though some of them give you increased car performance. Don’t worry about this Mod system giving anybody an unfair advantage in multiplayer, though; they don’t apply there. Forza 6’s online multiplayer has performed well during testing; even during heavy rain and playing against opponents from far across the Pacific the racing was smooth and lag-free. Equally good news? Those of you who prefer couch multiplayer are still covered; unlike most developers Turn 10 hasn’t forgotten split-screen. Like a big bucket of Hot Wheels brought to life, Forza Motorsport 6 is first-order car porn for the automobile obsessed but remains an accessible and exciting racer for those who just want to drive fast in something red with a horse logo on it. It’s spinning its wheels in a few areas but what’s here is undoubtedly some of the finest racing you can find on console and easily worth the upgrade from Forza 5.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	 The “toys-to-life” genre is growing increasingly competitive, but nobody has a better collection of action figures at their disposal than the big kids behind Disney Infinity 3.0. This third entry in the series is the most polished, cohesive, and enjoyable one to date, fusing a rollicking, intergalactic Star Wars campaign with a staggeringly customisable Toy Box mode. In short, it’s an experience that really lives up to its line-up of all-star ingredients.   The Avengers play set included with last year’s game was a disappointment, mainly because it featured one of the most uninspiring video game versions of Manhattan ever made, populated with samey escort missions and rehashed enemy types. Fortunately the Star Wars: Twilight of the Republic play set bundled with Disney Infinity 3.0 rights most of its predecessor’s wrongs. It’s a nicely varied campaign set across multiple planets (and the space between), with diverse mission, environment, and enemy types to keep it feeling fresh over the course of its six hour duration (or substantially longer if you aim to complete all its challenges). Crucially, its combat is fantastic. Steered by the experienced hand of developer Ninja Theory, which has honed its combo-based craft on previous projects such as Heavenly Sword and Devil May Cry, character attacks feel substantially tighter and more fluid than the previous Infinity games. As Yoda, I delighted in pinballing between multiple enemies, leaving groups of enemy droids showering sparks and body parts in my wake. As Anakin I was able to Force-pull a shield out of an enemy’s hands, before dashing forward to uppercut them into the air and juggle them with spectacular saber swings. It’s worth noting that enemies finally have visible health bars in this game, a welcome addition that makes it easier to identify which ones to pick off first in a crowd.   While all of the Star Wars heroes share the same basic suite of skill upgrades, such as boosts to health and attack strength, there are enough character-specific moves and combos to make it fun to switch between multiple characters (should your budget allow it). Yet unlike the game’s Toy Box mode, Twilight of the Republic doesn’t really lock any substantial content away behind character-specific doors - you can enjoy all of its missions and side quests without having to fork out for additional toys, which is very much appreciated. That’s not to say that Twilight of the Republic is perfect. It would have benefited from a splash of the nudge-wink humour employed by the LEGO games, or even some of Skylanders’ excellent environmental puzzles. There’s also quite a bit of repetition with some of the side quests; the podracing in particular seems like a missed opportunity by offering only one opponent to challenge. But these minor grievances are quickly forgotten once you’re dogfighting separatist ships in the space junk-filled orbit of Geonosis, indulging in flashy lightsaber brawls in the Jedi Temple training room or gleefully hurling your co-op partner into a belching sarlaac pit. It might not reach the level of cinematic authenticity the upcoming Battlefront is targeting, but as far as story-based adventures go Twilight of the Republic offers up one of the most entertaining Star Wars videogame experiences in years.  And that’s just the play set. The more flexible and feature-packed other half of Disney Infinity 3.0 is once again the Toy Box mode, which has been refined and expanded upon in almost every way. The new Toy Box Hub is essentially one massive tutorial designed to school you on its world building tools and inspire you to create your own game modes, but there’s literally hours of fun to be found within it before you even think about crafting your own levels or sampling those shared by the community. You can play paintball skirmishes against the gang from Monsters Inc, perform vehicular tricks in a stadium stunt course, or zoom through an aerial checkpoint race from London to Neverland. Or you could just equip Spider-Man with a lightsaber and take on Syndrome’s robot army on the Disneyland main street. The more you do, the more you unlock and level up your chosen character. Additionally, a new sidekick system has been introduced. These pint-sized assistants are kind of like giving your Disney Infinity toys their own Amiibo. You can put your super-deformed buddies to work on crops in the game’s farming area (probably the first time you’ll ever see a Wookiee with a sun hat and watering can), which then reap rewards in the form of food to level up your sidekicks and items to equip them with. It's worth your while to nurture sidekicks because they can fight alongside you and bring additional benefits; if one of them is wearing a medic hat they’ll replenish your character’s health bar when you pick them up, for example.  After completing all of the tutorial levels and challenges in the Toy Box Hub, I still lack the talent and inclination to build my own levels or game types to any meaningful degree. But the important thing is that I at least feel like I have a handle on all the creation tools - which is something I never felt with the previous Infinity games - and I eagerly await what the community will do with the robust creation suite on offer combined with the vastly improved controls. From fully functional RPGs to Splatoon-inspired shooters to Rube Goldberg marble runs that play the melody from It’s a Small World with each bounce of the ball; it’s all theoretically possible. Despite the raft of improvements to the Toy Box mode and the superior campaign, it must be said that Disney Infinity 3.0’s starter pack does feel somewhat lighter than those offered for the previous games in terms of what you get in the actual box. Whereas Disney Infinity 2.0: Marvel Super Heroes came with three character figures and two game discs, the new game comes with only two characters and no game discs. This limitation is compounded by the fact that the two included characters, Anakin and Ahsoka, are both lightsaber and Force power-based. If you want to experience the game’s third-person shooting (and you should because it’s great), you’re going to have to shell out for an additional character like Ezra Bridger or Sabine Wren from the outset. Disney Infinity 3.0 sees the pop culture powerhouse flexing its formidable mega franchise muscles with impressive results. It’s a game that doesn’t just encourage the player to have fun, it insists on it; offering up a generous helping of gameplay and countless things to unlock even before you start piling on all the optional add-ons. It’s truly a dizzying amount of Disney; a virtual toy box packed with some of the most beloved characters from the past hundred years of entertainment, polished up and overflowing with fun and options for creativity. It’s often said that the all-ages approach of Nintendo has led to it becoming the Disney of the videogame world. With Disney Infinity 3.0, the House of Mouse has made its most confident strides yet towards earning that title for its own.
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	" When I reviewed Dishonored back in 2012, I gave it a 9.2 (""Amazing""), concluding that: “It's a shame that Dishonored's story isn't greater than the sum of its decidedly memorable parts, but its gameplay absolutely is. Each mission is built as an elaborate network of choices for players to explore, and the same can be said for Corvo himself. Each player's selection of powers, perks and other upgrades will inform how they see and interact with this world, and no two play-throughs will be exactly the same. Dishonored is a game you'll talk with your friends about, and that you'll want to play multiple times. In this game there are always other paths to be taken and other challenges to conquer, and that's a refreshing thing indeed.”   Dishonored Definitive Edition incorporates the superb original game, the three pieces of subsequent DLC, and some additional in-game bonuses. Is it a “Definitive Edition”? Not exactly. In content terms, this is the same release as the Game of the Year Edition that came out almost two years ago. As far as presentation is concerned, Dishonored Definitive Edition certainly does look noticeably better than it did on PS3 and Xbox 360 – higher resolution, better textures, more vibrant colour - but it’s essentially on par with the original PC game running on half-decent gaming hardware. I revisited Dishonored on both PC and Xbox 360 then compared them to the PS4 and Xbox One versions, and the differences between current gen console and what the PC version was doing three years ago are non-existent. It still looks great, thankfully, but that has more to do with strong art direction and a cool painterly aesthetic than technical prowess. Dishonored was a little behind the curve on lighting, lip syncing, some of its texture work and a few other bits and pieces in 2012 and this release does nothing to rectify any of that. Nor does it deliver 60 frames per second gameplay, which is a huge missed opportunity. The Definitive Edition’s load times are also a lot longer than on last gen console and PC. This is all obviously disappointing, but not entirely unexpected. After all, the HD re-releases that actually make significant improvements to the original assets and engine are the exception to the rule. This isn’t a remaster, it’s simply another entry point for gamers that never played Dishonored, and from that perspective it serves its purpose well enough.   It’s worth noting, however, that Dishonored Definitive Edition makes the same mistake as the Game of the Year Edition, which included four sets of in-game bonuses that I can’t imagine were ever designed to be grouped together. To elaborate, there were four sets of pre-order bonuses for the original game’s Special Edition, divided up by retailer, with each offering additional in-game items that would be waiting for Corvo at the start of the game proper (after he has escaped from prison, joined the loyalists and come into his first power). Specifically, each had three exclusive Bone Charms (minor perks that allow players to customise their character above and beyond the core powers), a statue that unlocked the ability to equip an extra Bone Charm, and 500 bonus coins. The idea – I guess - was that players would choose the pack/retailer that sounded most appealing, and while it would give them a slight advantage, it wouldn’t mess with the progression of the game all that much. Awww, rats. The Game of the Year Edition, however, and now this Definitive Edition, throw all four packs into Corvo’s lodging room. Yes, that’s 12 Bone Charms, 2000 gold and the ability to equip seven Bone Charms right from the start. Putting aside how ridiculous that is in the context of the world – i.e. waking up in a run-down secret base literally surrounded by arcane magical charms, equally magical statues and several pouches overflowing with money – it works against the gameplay and the value of the upgrade systems in the game. Dishonored is designed so that you have to work hard to collect money to buy and upgrade gear. Bone Charms, similarly, are something you largely have to go out of your way to find. This farcical bonus takes away from their perceived value – even though the included Charms aren’t particularly exciting - and gives players an artificial starting position within the world. I really hate pre-order or special edition bonuses that impact the intended progression of gameplay and game balance, and that’s exactly what this does. You have enough money at the outset to simply max-out Corvo’s ability to equip Bone Charms immediately. Ten at the start instead of three? Ridiculous. Stilts are the tools of the corrupt and powerful. Nonetheless, this is the best version of the game available on console, so if you don’t own a gaming PC, and have always been curious about Dishonored, then I’d still recommend picking this up, particularly since it comes with both the story DLC packs – The Knife of Dunwall and The Brigmore Witches. They form a single tale, told in parallel with Corvo’s quest and focusing on Daud, the assassin responsible for killing the Empress at the start of Dishonored. I gave each a 7.5 in 2013, saying that although the gameplay was compelling it didn’t break much new ground, and the story delivered on some but not all of its potential. That’s still true, but they’re absolutely worth playing.  Looking at Dishonored today, there are elements of the design that haven’t aged gracefully, such as the tendency for mission design to be compartmentalised and the somewhat quirky controls, but the gameplay is still a liberating experience, as it’s grounded in player choice. It’s entirely up to you whether you cut a bloody swathe through the world or complete all the missions without a single kill. This may not be a true “Definitive Edition,” but the good news is that the greatest strengths of Dishonored – and its additional DLC – still shine through. The industrial port setting of Dunwall, for instance, is an inspired creation, and you get the full tour; from its most grimy plague-ridden streets to its most gilded ballrooms. The extensive written lore is complemented by great visual storytelling, and incredibly memorable art direction across the board. Corvo and Daud are strong leads too, with an evolving set of supernatural powers that allow them to do things like teleport, slow time, possess other characters and see through walls. Missions accommodate this versatility well, with multiple routes, a whole lot of verticality and countless secrets for those that take the time to explore."
Jared Petty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	 Mega Man Legacy Collection is an extraordinary implementation of accurate emulation, a clean interface, archival content, and thoughtful remixes that distill what I love about Mega Man into tense new challenges. You won’t find any flashy new graphics, skins, or arcane layers of unlockable hidden content -  just a handful of remarkable platformers treated like the video-game royalty they are. The visual execution in Legacy Collection is stellar, producing a crisp, perfectly-proportioned image on HD displays. Both boxed and vertically fullscreen 4:3 ratio options are clean and precise-looking. The two filtering options (on all but the 3DS version) were also welcome, especially the monitor filter simulating the bright, crisp sharpness of a vintage arcade display.  I did encounter one minor emulation error in the 3DS port. While playing Mega Man 3, I spotted one enemy who appeared as primarily red on one screen, and a slightly-different shade of purple on the other. The effect wasn’t jarring, in fact, it was so subtle that I might not have noticed it had it not been pointed out to me.   All six Mega Man games included in Legacy Collection are well worth your time, and the best are positively stupendous examples of responsive control, textbook level design, and of course, great weapons like Metal Man’s blade and the groovy Gemini Laser. Every platform’s position seems chosen with pixel-perfect care, making jumps difficult but almost never unfair. Carefully-placed enemies add tension to the leaping challenges, occasionally punctuated by huge, flavorful,  beautifully-rendered robot foes. Almost every stage presents unique new motifs and mechanics, with conveyor belts, disappearing blocks, insidious traps, low gravity zones, and a welcome host of other modifiers. Every platform’s position seems chosen with pixel-perfect care.  Each Mega Man game allows you to save a single restore point, a welcome addition as it eliminates the need to deal with Mega Man's anachronistic password system. I did, however, find myself missing the easy one-touch rewind function included in Rare Replay. Legacy Collection’s archival database includes an immense Mega Man bestiary, with official background information and art for every enemy you encounter, and it’s absolutely packed with obscure facts from the Capcom archives. Included in the encyclopedic content is the option to hop in and challenge any of the Robot Masters with a full arsenal of weapons, allowing you to learn their patterns, test, strategies, and hone tactics for the time-attack encounters included in challenge mode. Alongside the database is a voluminous image gallery which presents a generous sampling of high-quality concept art including incredible 3D concept sketches of the Mega Man stages, a bit of 8-Bit arcana I'd never dreamed existed. There’s even a few extra goodies packed into the 3DS port.  The Remix modes are excellent, sending Mega Man through a series of timed challenges stitched together from carefully-selected chunks of the Collection. By leaping between portals, I faced previously-impossible gauntlets of jumps, boss battles, and thematic tests. I particularly appreciated these wicked nods to Capcom's fiendish design-devilry. Times are shared on leaderboards with access to archived video of the most successful runs, allowing you to watch and refine successful strategies. Though the 3DS version doesn't get the leaderboards, it includes Amiibo functionality which unlocks several new challenges stages to make up for it. Mega Man Legacy Collection is an object lesson for how game compilations should be engineered, providing rock-solid adaptation to a new platform, respecting the material’s historic context, and exercising restraint. I recommend it both to Mega Man fans and to players who haven't had the privilege of experiencing these exemplary games.
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/madden-nfl-16-review	 Let’s get it out of the way right up front: Madden NFL 16 is in no way just another “roster update.” Core gameplay mechanics have seen huge changes that turn the annual football franchise into more of a simulation than ever before. Interesting new additions to throwing and receiving changed the way I play in a meaningful and refreshing way, making Madden NFL 16 one of the best Madden games of recent memory.   Building on last year’s improvements to defensive play, this year the focus has been placed on the passing game. Receivers have been given new tools, allowing you to catch the ball exactly how you want, depending on the situation. For example, if your receiver is guarded closely by a defender who is directly contesting the ball, you can use the “aggressive catch” button to attempt an all-out, highlight reel type of catch. If your man is left wide open, you might opt for the “run after catch” option to snag the ball in stride, maximizing the amount of yard you can gain. If you aren't sure which option would be the most useful, a button prompt conveniently flashes above your receiver's head, so you start making use of these handy new features right away. That's not to say there isn't any decision-making involved though, as every option has a logical drawback. It’s important not to overuse the aggressive catch, for instance, as your receiver will be left more vulnerable to big hits. Where the possession catch might seem like the safest option, defenders actually have a better chance of cutting off the ball and making an interception. All told, these receiving options are a breath of fresh air, adding a level of nuance that hasn’t been seen in the franchise since the hit stick was first introduced. On top of the new receiver mechanics, QBs have also been given a few new weapons. Your QB can now attempt a touch pass by double tapping your receiver’s icon. These are great for putting enough air under the ball to get it over the head of a linebacker, but not enough as to where the safety can get to it.  Some of the new passing mechanics weren't as easy for me to learn as others, though. You can now choose to throw the ball high or low by holding a shoulder button while selecting your target, but you already have so much to think about after the snap that this felt like one thing too many at first. You already need to keep track of the pocket to make sure you don’t get sacked, watch your receivers to see when they’re open, and gauge how hard you want to throw the ball within a couple of seconds. That said, once I figured it out, putting it to use was immensely gratifying. Quarterbacks and receivers aren’t the only ones with new tools to play with though. Defensive backs can now choose between playing the ball or the receiver. Like the new catching mechanics, there's a risk/reward to each. Playing the ball provides the optimal path to the ball in an attempt to intercept or break up the pass, but if your defender is out of position you'll most likely miss the opportunity to make a tackle. Playing the receiver has the opposite effect. Rather than trying for an interception, your defender will try to dislodge the ball. There's less of a chance for a big play, but you're practically guaranteed that the tackle will be made.  In addition to the new gameplay mechanics, Madden NFL 16 adds a brand new game mode, Draft Champions. Over the course of 15 rounds, you’re offered a choice between one of three players, each at a different position that you most likely need filled. After the draft is over, you can either play against the computer or take your team online for a quick single elimination tournament. This simultaneously scratched my fantasy football itch and my Madden Ultimate Team itch, without the long term commitment. Connected Franchise mode returns almost exactly the same. The only notable addition is the dynamically changing drive goals, in which players are tasked with things like picking up multiple first downs on a drive, or completing consecutive passes. When completed, your team is given a slight XP and confidence boost, and gives a fairly realistic feeling of shifting momentum.  The microtransaction filled Madden Ultimate Team also returns mostly unchanged, and still feels a bit gross. But the new “ultimate moments,” where your MUT team is faced with bite-sized challenges that put you in specific situations that other teams have faced is a quick way to earn cards and coins. I particularly enjoyed the recreation of the goal line blunder at the end of last year’s Super Bowl. In terms of presentation, Madden 16 looks sharp, despite the fact that much of it has been reused from last year. But the addition of on-field graphical overlays that display live stats and full motion video, as well as the return of licensed music is a nice touch. Regrettably, the commentary remains dull and out of sync. Thankfully, playing online works the way that it should, with only the occasional glitch here and there. Simply put, Madden NFL 16 changes the way you play the game. The risk vs. reward aspect of the new passing and defending mechanics adds a level of realism the franchise has never seen. You can catch and throw the ball pretty much exactly how you want, and it feels great when you can pull a big play because of it.  On top of that, Draft Champions might be the new game mode we’ve been waiting for.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-review-2	" I can’t stop thinking about how refreshing Gears of War: Ultimate Edition feels. This first struck me as odd both because the original Gears is nine years old, and because I’ve played through that game several times. When it came out in 2006, Gears was the best looking game on the Xbox 360. Its pop-and-shoot cover mechanics felt at home on the controller, and its multiplayer modes were fun and reliable when Xbox Live was still finding its feet on new hardware. To be fair, these accomplishments were relative to the technology of the time, but Gears also had one timeless trait that even today’s games sometimes fail to capture: It told you exactly what it wanted to be, and it delivered on that promise in all the ways a game can until the credits rolled. Gears of War: Ultimate Edition, by its nature as a remaster, shares that same great vision, and it still looks and feels excellent.   Everything about Gears is loud, clear, and simple -- words that are often wrongly replaced with “stupid.” On the contrary, Gears is one of the most involved, attentive games I’ve played. It’s constantly concerned with whether the player knows what to do, and whether the player is having fun. This approach leaves no room for subtlety, but none is needed in a game so committed to raw function. Here’s how it all starts. Evil rock people called Locusts have emerged from beneath the planet’s surface and started killing everyone. You are Marcus Fenix, a tree trunk of a man freed from prison because, well, there just aren’t many good soldiers left. With a small band of brothers, Fenix and company must do their part to help deliver a bomb deep within the Locust’s underground home. It’s a simple and enjoyable story, well told through fun objectives, believable environments, and passionate, consistent voice performances for Marcus, Dom, Baird, and the Cole Train (baby).  Everything about Gears is loud, clear, and simple...  A note on our heroes: They sure are some dudes. They are the bro-est warriors ever, slamming magazines into their chainsaw guns using their fire hydrant-sized arms. They never just open doors, they blast them aside with violent kicks that I can only speculate are, like their guns, powered by combustion. And those guns, by the way, are named with gnarly, mechanical words: Torque Bow, Gnasher, Hammerburst. When they’re done killing stuff with their dirty weapons, the game celebrates the occasion with a chunky guitar riff. You’ll hear it a lot.   Any of these details alone would look silly -- possibly tone-destroying -- if Gears were less bold. But the game never apologizes for its style. This isn’t even a “fake it until you make it” situation. These bizarre characters and situations must be real because Gears wisely never offers another “normal” tone for us to consider. Moment to moment combat in Gears is fun, responsive, and challenging. Guns roar with power, and bullets really do hurt -- both for you and your enemies. A shotgun at close range will turn you into bloody beef slabs before you can yell “Reloading!” Gears looked and felt great before, but at 1080p and a solid 30 FPS, the action is smoother than it’s ever been, even when the bodies really start to pile up. In particular, animations look nice and crisp, and your war environments, which looked phenomenal on last-gen hardware, still impress with their new coat of paint. Taking cover grants temporary safety, but the Locust will soon move around the battlefield, flanking you from the side or taking the high ground. Some suicidally charge straight at you, which is unnerving because you have to deal with them, and to do that you’ll have to expose yourself to fire or abandon your cover. It’s a constant battle to find a safe space, and I enjoyed the challenge of reading enemy movements, responding to threats, and outsmarting bad guys who frequently outnumbered my squad three to one.   Like the original, though, the “A” button still does too much work. You press it to run. You press it to roll. You press it to take cover, to vault over cover, and to move from one piece of cover to the next. It’s too easy to try to do one thing, only to do accidentally do something that gets you killed. This is one of the few situations that reveals Gears’ age. Dotting the campaign are several incredible moments that, unlike most modern “set pieces,” affect how you play the game. They don’t happen around you; they happen to you, and they force you to adapt. One of the best examples is the game of cat and mouse between you and a terrifying Berserker -- a hulking, blind creature that tracks its prey through smell and sound, then charges at it like a rocket-powered big rig. For that fight, I had to constantly rethink my positioning so I didn't get stuck in a corner. Suddenly those cramped hallways which worked so perfectly for cover-based battles started to feel more like a prison, and I had one heck of a cellmate.  ...The “A” button still does too much work  In another level I had to stay in the light, otherwise I'd become dinner for evil swarming birds called Kryll. Their presence changed how I thought about my options in normal combat, and made for some really great and grotesque results if I ever stepped into the dark. Five extra campaign chapters, which are new to anyone who didn’t play the old PC version, include one of the best action sequences in the game. If you don’t know about the big surprise, do yourself a favor and don’t look it up.   Ultimate Edition includes two new multiplayer game modes, Team Deathmatch and King of the Hill, to the collection of modes from the original. Its 20 maps keep the game from feeling stagnant, and offer a variety of paths to outsmart your enemies -- especially in objective gametypes. The best part of multiplayer is that Gears’ over-the-top violence bleeds into it. There’s no way to die that isn’t satisfying and entertaining. chainsawed in half, shotgunned apart, gibbed by a giant space lasered, head-popped by a sniper. The potential for revenge and humiliation is high, and leads to some tense, gory fun at 60 FPS. However, the way those weapons are tuned for MP discourages Gears' great, tactical cover shooting. In 2006, closing the distance, rolling around like crazy, and blasting everything with a shotgun was incredibly effective. That tactic still works too well. Multiplayer combat will never feel like single-player, nor should it, but taking cover and peppering enemies with mid- to long-range weapons feels downright useless unless you grab a sniper. To make matters worse, the ""A"" button issues I mentioned earlier are ramped up significantly when the effective strategy is to spam the roll button (A) and hip fire your shotty. What made Gears great almost 10 years ago still makes Gears great today. It’s a beautiful game with smart cover mechanics, great core combat, and commitment to an over-the-top tone. It occasionally shows signs of age, but those moments are rare enough that you’ll barely remember you’re playing a remaster. If you haven’t jumped into the series yet, or simply need a refresher, Gears of War: Ultimate Edition is a great place to start."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	 Editor's Note: Review updated on 10/15/2015 to include impressions of Metal Gear Online. I had planned it all very carefully. There were way too many guards still looking for me, and with sunrise coming shortly, I had almost no chance of making it out to the nearest safe landing zone with an injured prisoner on my shoulders. But I wouldn’t have to. During the night, I planted some C4 on this outpost’s radio communication equipment, the anti-aircraft battery, and most importantly, their AA radar. So I took a deep breath, detonated all three at once, called in a chopper, and watched it all unfold. After a short while, my ride swooped in, blasting an APC to bits with a ferocious rocket barrage, and cutting infantry down with heavy machine gun fire as I scrambled from my hiding place to the main courtyard, prisoner in tow. I hopped in with my precious cargo, and then jumped on the side-mounted minigun to keep the newly arrived reinforcements at bay as my chopper smoked and sputtered its way out of the hotzone.  That’s Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain almost all the time, and what’s truly incredible is that none of this escape  was scripted or directed. My mission was simply to get that prisoner out alive. The rest of it, from the time of day I chose to approach to crippling the base’s ability to deal with an aerial assault was a testament to how perfectly all the pieces of Phantom Pain’s gameplay fit together. It is, unquestionably, my favorite Metal Gear to play, though I do wish its story delivered as many memorable moments as its sandbox empowered me to create for myself. The number of different factors to consider makes every bad situation you find yourself in a fun puzzle to solve.  Right from the moment you’re told to get on your horse and explore the Afghan countryside, Phantom Pain feels intimidating, almost overwhelming in terms of the freedom its open world affords and the number of concepts it expects you to grasp. It’s almost too much, especially given the relative linearity of previous Metal Gears. But what initially appeared to be an overly dense tangle of features to fiddle with instead unraveled into a well integrated set of meaningful gameplay systems that provided me with a wealth of interesting decisions to make. Let’s take another look at my daring prisoner rescue for instance. Phantom Pain’s day/night cycle and dynamic weather played a big role in my decision to pull the trigger on that C4. While I knew I wouldn’t have the cover of night, I was also fairly certain I wouldn’t have fog, a sandstorm, or even a little rain to make my footsteps harder to hear, because my intelligence team back at my base forecasted the weather in advance. I also knew that I needed a closer extraction point, so I sought out that anti-air radar to open one up. Then there was the comms equipment, which I messed up on. Since I didn’t destroy all of the transmitters, reinforcements from nearby outposts came to complicate things at the end. The number of different factors to consider makes every bad situation you find yourself in a fun puzzle to solve.    More importantly though, you’re free to solve those puzzles your own way because of how flexible Phantom Pain’s core gameplay is. The transition between careful stealth and going loud is a lot more organic than in any previous MGS, and getting aggressive never feels “wrong” the way it often does in stealth games. If someone spots you, you get a few seconds of slow motion (called Reflex Time) to take them down silently and prevent a full combat alert. Not only does this create a lot of tense, sweet-looking movie moments, but it gives you the freedom to take calculated risks with room for exciting mistakes.  Even when things do get out of hand, missions progress accordingly. Your carefully planned sneaking mission might turn into you chasing down a fleeing target on horseback, or a white-knuckle showdown with an enemy gunship instead, but going “off-script” isn’t a one-way ticket to failure and frustration. The fact that it’s relatively painless to experiment and get a little (or even extremely) aggressive makes playing with the many fun toys Phantom Pain provides a literal blast. I can call in a gunship for close air support, designate targets for a massive sleeping gas bomb, or have a customizable combat walker dropped in for me to wreak havoc with. Gunplay feels responsive, direct, and so very right, and unlike Ground Zeroes, I can use all this stuff guilt-free since it doesn’t completely tank my mission ratings.  That isn’t to say that playing like a trigger-happy maniac doesn’t have ramifications, because it most certainly does, thanks to Phantom Pain’s fantastic base-management layer, Mother Base, which is far deeper and and more detailed than it has any reasonable excuse to be. It’s essentially the full realization of all the good ideas Peace Walker seeded. From Mother Base, you manage the construction, staffing, and R&D needs of your growing mercenary group, the Diamond Dogs. Every soldier I kill and every supply truck I mercilessly blow up in the field is missed potential. In other games, enemy outposts are simply filled with threats to be eliminated, but in Phantom Pain they are opportunities to gain resources and new recruits. And as it turns out, it takes a whole lot of money, manpower, and materials to run a successful private military corporation. There's an outrageous number of guns, gadgets, and abilities to unlock for yourself, and for the vehicles and sidekicks you’ll employ throughout the story campaign - and many require you to meet several criteria to snag them. You’ll need to keenly assign new recruits to an arm of your infrastructure suited to their talents, send well-rounded combat groups out on side contracts to keep money coming in, and direct research efforts much like you would in an X-COM campaign. The breadth of options to choose from and decisions to make isn’t the most impressive thing though - it’s the fact that all of it has a relevant, meaningful impact when you head out onto the field. Granted, re-assigning newly conscripted soldiers across different branches of my base sounds about as sexy as balancing my checkbook, but when, for instance, my R&D team threw me a newly modified version of my favorite assault rifle, or when re-routing personnel into support and logistics led to me gaining access to off-map artillery bombardment, I was glad I took the time to sweat the details. The door swings both ways too: just as those back-end decisions become tangible boons in the field, the choices I make during a mission have ramifications for the resource crunch at home as well.  Resource management is, in fact, the blood coursing through the veins of this open world, giving its many interconnected infiltration spaces their reason to be. While Phantom Pain’s thoughtfully structured sandboxes provided the freedom to sneak by smaller outposts on my way to my primary objective, I rarely did. After all, those unsuspecting guards could have vital intel, and they sure aren’t going to interrogate themselves. They might know the location of a supply truck I could steal to drive into the next base unmolested, or they could spill the location of a talented gunsmith for me to rescue. Sure, it’ll take me out of my way, but I’d finally be able to research that sweet new anti-material sniper rifle I’ve been lusting after. This masterfully woven relationship between The Phantom Pain’s many systems, both management and action-based, elevates its gameplay to a wholly different plane than its many open-world action contemporaries.    However, where Phantom Pain’s gameplay systems are far richer and meatier than any the series has ever seen, its story feels insubstantial and underdeveloped by comparison. It opens confidently, with Director Hideo Kojima ready to fully embrace the techno-fantasy, live-action military anime identity that Metal Gear has been courting for the better part of two decades. This spectacular opening establishes a mood and a bundle of plot-related questions that are more or less abandoned until the time comes, some 30-60 hours later (depending on which answers you’re seeking and how you play). Though some connect to the greater Metal Gear lore nicely, those answers are generally rushed and unsatisfying, lacking any real build-up or thematic relevance.  This is doubly disappointing in a series known for (sometimes clumsily and exhaustively) exploring  its subject matter. The opposite is true here though. The Phantom Pain brings up topics like the personal cost of revenge, child soldiers, and torture to name a few, but it has positively nothing to say about any of them other than that they exist. Thankfully though, it never wasted my time pretending to say more, as cut scenes were sparse and brief, so as to let me get back to playing. As nice as that might be though, I’d rather have the “problem” that Guns of the Patriots had, where there were “too many” awesome moments and plot twists. For their part, Phantom Pain’s story elements are at least well produced, with beautiful cinematography, and workmanlike performances from everyone, including Keifer Sutherland, who sadly has practically nothing to do as Big Boss. His inexplicable silence through even the most crucial story beats towards the end go beyond mere stoicism, and were positively jarring. Almost gone are the off-topic codec convos, climactic boss battles, and memorable character moments of Metal Gears past. Everyone seems to exist solely to walk on screen, deliver information, and then stand there dramatically. The only real exception to this is the sniper Quiet, whose warm, childlike sincerity and battlefield ferocity cause her to steal every scene she’s in. Her preposterous lack of clothing undercuts those qualities a fair bit though: one particular moment later in the game comes off a bit creepy instead of endearing solely because of her outfit. You seriously could have put her in generic army fatigues and she would still have been the most interesting character here - the fact that she’s also required to be a lust-object is disappointing. It’s surprising, though, how little Phantom Pain’s story woes actually impacted my experience with it. It takes an almost completely hands-off approach to both story and gameplay, which means that the lion’s share of the takeaway moments will almost certainly be the ones of your own orchestration. But given how readily Phantom Pain facilitates the creation of those moments, it’s difficult for me to feel bad about that. In a decade, I doubt there will be a single mission I’ll be able to point to and say “remember when you had to do that,” but I could fill a book with stories about how I dealt with a mission going south, or a brilliant plan I came up with that worked just like I thought it should. This is certainly the least “authored” Metal Gear, but it’s also the most player-driven, and I’d gladly take the helicopter escape story I shared earlier over any scripted event or set-piece.  That memory creation doesn’t end with the story missions though. Phantom Pain still has more layers of depth to unfurl with its online Forward Operating Base, which allows you to construct additional fortresses aside from your main Mother Base. You’ll allocate resources, manpower, and fixed defenses that you’ve secured out in the field to defending these bases from online invaders. You’ll also invade the bases of other players in an attempt to secure resources, high-ranking recruits, and most importantly enemy nukes. FOB is, ultimately, about nuclear proliferation, where you can choose to build up a massive WMD stock, or steal and disarm those of others. I only got a couple of hours to mess around with it, but since these extra bases require resources just like your main one, they provides ample incentive to continue to explore and plunder Phantom Pain’s sizeable sandboxes well after the credits have rolled.   Metal Gear Online could easily have felt tacked on in the grand scope of what Metal Gear Solid 5 achieves, but thanks to excellent map design, and modes that make meaningful use of Metal Gear’s mechanics, it doesn’t. It’s probably too light on modes and maps to compete directly with multiplayer-focused games, but what it lacks in quantity, it mostly makes up in quality.  Each of MGO’s modest pool of five excellent maps feels wide open. There’s plenty of room for 16 players to maneuver, as well as a wide variety of encounter spaces within each map. Stairwells lead from dangerous courtyards with 360 degrees of engagement angles, down to networks of tight, narrow corridors. Large, small, day, and night map variants, along with a dynamic weather system add further wrinkles, forcing you to adopt new tactics when visibility is impaired. Plentiful nooks and crannies and a healthy variety of routes from A to B make these maps ideal playgrounds for tactical espionage shenanigans. Tricks like hiding in boxes, sliding down ramps, and luring enemies to their doom with an adorable puppy that forces them to uncontrollably cuddle it are even more fun to pull on humans than against the AI. These maps are ideal playgrounds for tactical espionage shenanigans.  Even in its closest analog to team deathmatch, called Bounty Hunter, MGO makes great use of The Phantom Pain’s sophisticated stealth mechanics without boiling them down to run-and-gun. The objective is simply to drain the opposing side’s tickets by killing them, but there’s a fantastic twist. Every kill you score raises the bounty on your head, and if someone manages to take you down non-lethally and Fulton you out, all the tickets you’ve claimed go back to your opponent’s total. Not only does this create value for using stealthy, non-lethal tactics, it adds a tangible risk to using lethal force, which leads to tense, tactical showdowns with the potential for some thrilling last-second comebacks. MGO’s other two modes are the asymmetrical attack-and-defend Cloak and Dagger and the territory-control variation Comm Control. They aren’t quite as inventive as Bounty Hunter, but they still make smart use of The Phantom Pain’s gadgets and mechanics. Interrogating foes reveals the positions of the entire enemy team, and Fultoning stunned enemies nets your team a ton more points than just killing them. These points decide the winner in a draw, cleverly rewarding players for playing like you would in a Metal Gear game.  The one really disappointing thing about Metal Gear Online is that it doesn’t tie back into the single player experience in any way, a stark contrast to The Phantom Pain’s brilliant FOB mode, which feels like a direct extension of the main campaign’s themes and mechanics. By comparison, MGO seems like a really enjoyable, but unrelated side-activity, which feels like a missed opportunity. That said, it still adds yet another well-done element to The Phantom Pain’s already impressive gameplay super-structure. The Phantom Pain is the kind of game I thought would never exist - one where every minute gameplay detail has true purpose. Its lack of story focus is sure to be divisive for the Metal Gear faithful, but the resulting emphasis on my story, my tales of Espionage Action, easily make it my favorite in the series. There have certainly been sandbox action games that have given me a bigger world to roam, or more little icons to chase on my minimap, but none have pushed me to plan, adapt, and improvise the way this one does. Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain doesn’t just respect my intelligence as a player, it expects it of me, putting it in a league that few others occupy.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/20/zombi-review	 Zombi feels like the creation of two very different developers. Its handling of death, exploration, and NPC design is fresh and confident, especially in the crowded zombie genre. Yet, when it’s time to fight -- and it often is -- Zombi encourages some of the dullest, most repetitive combat I’ve seen in this generation of games. These opposing ideas keep Zombi from realizing its potential, but the heights it reaches are still pretty darn high. Nothing about Zombi’s garden-variety undead surprised me. Aside from a few special variants, they’re slow, dumb, and deadly in numbers. Their one powerful advantage is that, if they kill you, your infected character is permanently added to the zombie horde. Any weapons or supplies you were carrying in your BOB (Bug-out Bag) remain with your old, zombified character until they are retrieved -- a task made all the more difficult if you didn’t hide away extra equipment for your next random playable survivor. Preparation is key.  This was also the main hook of ZombiU, the 2012 Wii U game. Here's our old review. Zombi, if you didn’t know, is a new version of that game, now made for Xbox One, PS4, and PC. It includes a few updates, but ditches the multiplayer mode which required the Wii U gamepad. Because valuable goods (like bullets) are so rare, and because fighting zombies takes so long (more on this soon), Zombi’s unique death system adds welcome and constant tension to every encounter, no matter how small. However, the game puts no effort into making me care about my characters in a human way. Despite different names, ages, and genders, all my survivors were really the same thing: a vessel to carry the possessions I actually did care about. It’s a shame, because while Zombi’s main story events are predictable and silly, the characters I met along the way were each well-defined, motivated, and just insane enough to keep me from trusting them. There’s the “Prepper,” a man who heeded 400-year-old prophetic zombie warnings and now, for reasons I don’t want to discuss, allows survivors (myself included) to live in his safe house. Another man fortified Buckingham Palace and used its resources, including imprisoned test-subject zombies, to work on developing a cure. The cast grows much larger in the second half of the game, and I welcomed the mad ensemble for the flavor it brought to an otherwise familiar setting. In exchange for shelter or new technology, most people wanted something from me. Their quests sent me deep into zombie-infested districts of London, which are silent and eerie, and usually stayed that way unless I ran around like an idiot. It isn’t a particularly beautiful game world, but Zombi rightfully puts the emphasis on sound and lighting rather than a raw pixel count. The rough edges didn’t matter when I crept along at a snail’s pace with my eyes locked on the next dark hallway. The artists and sound designers nailed the atmosphere. Zombi’s high-stakes and dark environments demand caution, but it also gave me the tool I needed to make that caution as painless as possible. Early on, the Prepper hands over the appropriately named “Prepper Pad,” which allows you to quickly see which containers and bodies were worth looting, which doors could and couldn’t open, and, simply, which direction you need to go. I didn’t waste any time rummaging through empty bins or searching dead zombies for healing cake and soda. It’s nice to see a game respect your time, especially one so punishing in most other aspects.   However, that specific praise went right out the window when it was time to fight. Zombi’s zombies were tough suckers. They killed me with a handful of good swings, and they took several hits to bring down. I started with a cricket bat, which usually took out one enemy with four or five solid swings -- more if the enemy was wearing a helmet. Zombies often rushed me two or three at a time, making combat a slow, rhythmic back-and-forth, swing-and-hit dance, void of both skill and variety. Sure, there are firearms, but they feel too weak, and Zombi constantly stresses how important it is not to use my ammo. From the rarity of bullets to the limitations of my storage to the Prepper straight-up telling me bullets are the new precious metals, I was trained not to shoot unless there was a Capital-P Problem. This was one of the major complaints from reviews of ZombiU, and the developers appear to have listened -- sort of. Extra melee weapons were added to Zombi, and they are stronger than the cricket bat, but… not by much. It says something about the combat system when I scoffed at a double-barreled shotgun but felt overjoyed when I picked up a shovel. Melee weapons simultaneously feel like a bad option and the only option. Zombi is the textbook example of a game that needs a sequel. Within the trope-ripe grounds of the zombie shooter, it builds interesting NPCs, delivers genuine scares, and makes deaths mean something more than a respawn. With more exciting combat, Zombi might have been a must-own for horror fans. As it stands, it’s a fun game that does most things right, but constantly reminds you of its biggest flaw.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	 With its close-up third-person camera, an emphasis on spontaneous, explosive action, and larger-than-life mythological names like Zeus, Hercules, and Medusa, Smite uniquely accomplishes what many have tried before – to bring the density and complexity of a MOBA to the console in an accessible way that feels natural. Hi-Rez Studios misses almost no beats in translating the excellent Smite PC experience from keyboard to controller, thanks in large part to that unique point of view, where you directly control one of over 60 gods, demigods or monsters of myth that all look and sound fantastic. But though it is very good, the translation isn’t quite perfect.  Nearly every attack or ability in Smite is a skill shot – meaning it has to be aimed, there are very few free shots here – and so the reduced precision and reaction time from keyboard to controller means some abilities are just inherently more difficult to aim. But outside that slight hinderance, Smite’s customizable controls are accessible, and its many systems have been completely retooled for intuitive controller support without losing all those layers of functionality.  For example, the in-match store that houses a seemingly endless number of clickable items and options to customize your god is tackled in a streamlined system of organized menus. Smite’s depth is here from top to bottom, and nothing has been watered down – but it comes at the cost of some minor interface blemishes, a few clunky menus, and the occasional stutter. But there’s thoughtful design at work behind this version of Smite in the menu redesigns, the on-the-fly, in-match systems, and the core controls that bring every intense engagement to life.  And that feeling of epic, strategic battle with superpowered gods is alive and well on Xbox One. Hovering high in the air with Thor’s powerful ultimate and gazing down on a battlefield full of targets before crashing down hammer-first and obliterating an opponent is as potent as ever. As is running through the jungle cloaked as Loki, waiting to ambush an enemy god out of place, and burying his twin daggers deep in their back. Smite remains a fast-paced game of smart strategy that demands cooperation and communication to survive and thrive in its spontaneous eruptions of white-knuckle team combat. And with its many varied game modes, it’s near-never-ending progression system, it’s one-time progress transfer from PC to console, and its reasonable, and genuinely unintrusive free-to-play pricing, you’re free to become as wholly invested in Smite on the Xbox One as you can on the PC. Whether you're looking for casual action combat, or something to master through an investment of thousands of hours, Smite on the Xbox One is a well of frenetic action and smart strategy that runs as deep as you're willing to dive. Its thoughtful translation from PC to Xbox One bears only minor nicks from that process, yet it maintains its genuine free-to-play pricing model that allows every character to be unlocked organically through gameplay without investing a cent. Smite's accessible roster of divine characters, action-based controls and awesome abilities not only make it incredibly easy to be sucked in, but an excellent entry point into a genre that's notoriously uninviting for new players.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	 “Walking simulator” is a fairly recent sub-genre term for a game whose only proper mechanics are, in fact, wandering through the story itself. In the case of Beyond Eyes, it can be applied almost literally. It’s a fascinating premise for a novella in video game form and a noble attempt to express the sensory challenges a blind person faces, but with little else but the story to rely on, Beyond Eyes’ plot just isn’t up to the task. Rae is a young girl in search of her cat, Nani, who’s wandered away from Rae’s home and into the surrounding wilderness and villages. The feline hunt is a slow, methodical exercise due to Rae’s handicap: blindness. Because she has only her memories to tell her brain what things look like in the wake of a childhood accident that took her vision, her impairment is creatively and beautifully represented on screen as an all-white canvas that colors in piece by piece through touches, sounds, and smells that trigger those memories.  At two to three hours long, Beyond Eyes never has a chance to overstay its welcome. But unlike Journey or many of Telltale’s short-form adventures, Rae’s story is debilitatingly barebones. Its entire script – delivered through the occasional update on Nani through on-screen text – is more like an outline that could fit on a cocktail napkin. There’s just not enough context to make me care for Rae beyond the empathy I’d have for anyone who’s lost their sight. Beyond Eyes fails to capitalize on its chance to tell a more emotionally impactful story in the context of Rae’s affliction. Even a piano-led musical score hints at a game wanting to do more, but the music is heard so rarely that usually you’ll be wandering in utter silence. Occasionally, Rae’s plight reaches out to give a meaningful moment of what a blind girl’s life must really be like; barking dogs and meddlesome crows become terrifying obstacles that cause Rae to physically recoil in fear (even though no harm can come to her in this game) and the thundering sounds of a rainstorm limit one of her remaining senses, inhibiting her ability to navigate her world. In those few brief moments, Beyond Eyes’ concept works. But the overwhelming majority of your time is simply spent wandering around each of its six chapters, running into dead ends and doubling back to look for a better route, hoping Nani is around the next corner.  Just as my freshly poured disappointment began to harden like concrete, however, the end of Beyond Eyes emotionally affected me – finally! I won’t spoil it to say quite how it did it, but know that I was happy that it had finally moved me. I had genuine, strong feelings towards the way the story concluded, and I left it appreciating that. If Rae’s tale had shown this side of itself prior to the last five minutes, it might’ve been onto something. I badly wanted Beyond Eyes to use its attractively whitewashed look and novel, visually limited ideas to tell a much more moving story whose empathetic lessons could’ve stayed with me long after the end credits rolled, but it didn’t. Only its ending taps into this potential, and it’s a shame the rest of its short playthrough time couldn’t follow suit.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/03/rare-replay-review	 Rare Replay has set a new bar for video game compilations. Though they range from all-time greats like Banjo-Kazooie to forgettable missteps, the 30 games included in here tell the story of not only a single studio, but of the past three decades of video game history. From the early days of home console gaming with Jetpac, to the rise of the console shooter in Perfect Dark, all the way to a pair of Xbox 360 launch games, Rare Replay’s breadth and depth is consistently impressive. From the moment Rare Replay boots up, it’s evident that this isn’t just some haphazard collection of ROMs and emulators. The theatrical presentation, complete with a fantastic musical number and charming transitions, lend a playful sense of place and character to the collection. It’s loaded with awesome extras, ranging from unused music and concept art, to fascinating documentaries on the making of classics like Conker and Killer Instinct, as well as some looks at some of Rare’s unreleased games. There’s a level of detail and quality here that we don’t see often enough in compilations like these.   Of course, all of these great extras wouldn’t amount to much if the games themselves weren’t worth revisiting. Thankfully, a solid chunk of the 30 included hold up as great experiences, even in 2015. For example, the original Banjo-Kazooie still remains one of the best 3D platformers ever made. The characters are charming, the music is incredible, and the levels are some of the most varied, smartly designed stages the genre has ever seen. Plus, Rare Replay includes the XBLA version, meaning that its strong art direction gets the benefit of HD resolution. Further back in time are lesser-known, but incredibly innovative games like Jetpac and Snake Rattle ‘n’ Roll. The former still provides a simple-yet-entertaining mix of an arcade shooter with resource management, while the latter is a strange isometric platformer that feels like what would’ve happened if you gave Marble Madness a story. Rare Replay also includes a handful of the studio’s strangest, most unique experiments. Blast Corps, for instance is an insane action-puzzler where you have to destroy everything in the path of a nuclear warhead being driven through a variety of settings. If the nuke comes into contact with a single thing, the whole world explodes, lending a really great sense of tension to each stage.   On the complete opposite side of the tension scale are the two Viva Pinata games, which are about as calming as games can be. Clearing out your field, planting your garden, and watching colorful critters start to populate your world still feels just as good as it did back in 2006. Then there are those that have failed to withstand the test of time. For every Banjo, there’s a very boring Grabbed by the Ghoulies. For every influential console shooter like Perfect Dark, there’s the hand-holding frustration of Perfect Dark Zero. But I appreciate that Rare Replay didn’t go down the revisionist-history route by omitting its mistakes, and instead provide a real, honest portrait of the studio’s work. It’s not quite a complete look, however, as some of the most famous games Rare has made aren’t here due to legal issues. Nintendo’s everlasting death grip on the Donkey Kong Country trilogy and Goldeneye 007 mean they won’t likely ever appear on the Xbox One. Fortunately, the rest of Rare’s work is great enough to stand up without those classics.   While most of the games in Rare Replay are presented as you might remember them from decades ago, there are some much-appreciated additions of modern convenience that made my trip back through the ‘80s and ‘90s much more tolerable than it would’ve been if I’d just dusted off an old NES and SNES. You’re able to quickly use save and load states in any pre-Nintendo 64 game, which means you can slowly chip away at simplistic-yet-fun games like R.C. Pro-Am and Cobra Triangle without long trips back to save checkpoints after each death. Even better, the ability to freely rewind the action to any point in your last 10 seconds of play without any punishment means that the infamously hair-pulling Turbo Tunnel stage in Battletoads can now be completed by those of us who aren’t terrifying video game savants. Rare Replay also includes dozens of fun, self-contained minigames based on specific scenes in the pre-N64 games called Snapshots, which unfold a bit like those in NES Remix. Things like seeing how far you can get in an endless version of Turbo Tunnel, or trying to keep a civilian safe for 60 seconds in Cobra Triangle are bite-sized and addictive score-based challenges that doubles as a smart way of introducing you to the core mechanics of the lesser-known Rare games.  While these tweaks and extra features are all great, I was a bit bummed out that the handful of 360 and XBLA games boot up in an Xbox 360 emulator, which adds an extra 10-15 seconds of waiting just to get to a title screen. That definitely slows down the pace of popping in and out of games, as you would in an actual arcade. But what’s worse is that there’s some noticeable slowdown on a few of the more recent games, particularly Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts and Bolts, and it’s sad that in those specific cases, poor performance makes this collector’s version worse than the original experience. Rare Replay is an incredible package. Its presentation is charming, the extras are amazing, and so many of the games included here are still a blast to play. Whether it’s your first time through or you’re revisiting decades later, Rare’s journey through the past 30 years of video game history is a fascinating one, and Rare Replay does an incredible job of capturing the essence of what makes the studio’s work so unique in our medium.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	 Developer Dontnod has a lot to answer for with Life Is Strange: Episode 4 -- Dark Room. It begins and ends with emotionally charged scenes that remind me why I like main character Max Caulfield so much. She’s a compassionate, believable protagonist stuck in an ugly sequence of events that’s resistant to change, no matter how hard she tries. That said, this up-and-down three-hour episode betrays a lot of what makes her special. Dark Room is the most inconsistent episode in Life Is Strange so far. The two hours between the excellent prologue and the finale advances the story slowly, and spends most of its time rehashing of what Life Is Strange has already done better before. The story and choices swing wildly from believable lucid to incomprehensible and gross. At times, Dark Room is just plain cheap. Max’s major choices here don’t suit her behavior, or are shocking for the sake of shock value, and that’s really disappointing. It’s a serious tone problem. The fallout from Episode 3, while grim, paves the way for a beautiful look at a friendship Max might have had if things had been different. The new timeline is quickly wiped away and forgotten in a cowardly and convenient cop-out. Life Is Strange quickly ditches its somber best buddies and Blade Runner references theme for a dirtier, scarier Girl With the Dragon Tattoo vibe. I enjoy these things, but they fit together like Thomas Harris writing Nancy Drew. I appreciate the dark, violent underworld Max starts exploring in Dark Room, but it comes at a price. Max and Chloe’s investigation dives deep into her school’s drug problem, the missing Rachel Amber, and how a corrupt local family is connected to it all. It’s a cool string of connected events but it comes together by way of a complicated, poorly explained puzzle. Connecting evidence is tedious, and because Life Is Strange has such low-res textures, it’s even more difficult to piece the right information together. It pays off well, at least. I’m glad the meandering main-plot mystery finally unravels, but that comes at a cost as well. I’m left as intrigued as I am confused as events come to a head in Life Is Strange’s upcoming finale. I have a lot of “Why?” questions, but they’re the kind that result from poor storytelling, not good mystery setup. Some of them make me want to learn more, but most of them make me wish Dark Room was more sophisticated than its sloppy story was. Click for all episode reviews of the game Life is Strange. Dark Room is the most complicated, conflicting episode of Life Is Strange yet. It sets up a finale that could be a genuine stunner, but there’s a lot resting on its shoulders. That finale will need to even out the drastic and disappointing change in tone established in Dark Room, which compromises its characters for the sake of a cool mystery. An emotional intro and devastating outro show how well Dontnod can handle both separately, but the hours in between leave so much to be desired in terms of marrying these people to their story.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review	 King's Quest: A Knight to Remember is a beautiful experiment in resurrecting the conventions of gaming’s past and dressing them up in the lush graphics available today. For the most part, it works, with this, the first of five episodes, telling a lighthearted fantasy story around simple action and rewarding puzzles about knights and dragons. The middle of its roughly six hours can drag a bit as you hunt down the items you need to progress, but even those are full of detailed art and enthusiastic performances.   As with the classic King’s Quest game from 1984, a Knight to Remember is the story of the likeable but overly excitable Graham, who's working his way toward being a knight (and eventually king). But this new version is a quality reboot that tells an all-new story of Graham’s attempts to outwit four other candidates for an open knight position, and it’s told capably enough that it should be appealing to newcomers as well as veterans. The caveat to that is that there’s no tutorial or even a quest list to introduce new players to the conventions of this old-school-style adventure and guide you through it, which means you’ll have to be comfortable figuring things out on your own. This is a tale with a strangely appealing tone, as extended periods of goofy humor straight of classic Disney movies contrast with occasional scenes of surprising violence. To take a light example, you go from slaughtering goblins in one moment to cracking jokes with merchants in the next. Major story-altering choices are rare, but the ones I did encounter gave good opportunities to craft my version of Graham's story into either that of a hero or a bit of a coward. Others, such as an early decision as to whether to kill a dragon, may have much import for episodes to come (but there’s no way to know just yet). Much thought has gone into making the land of Daventry seem real, too - it's filled with little tidbits of lore that go far beyond the core story, all of which were worth reading. Perhaps best of all, the whole adventure is framed as a tale told by the aging Graham to his rambunctious granddaughter Gwendolyne. and it's here where most of King's Quest's charms reveal themselves. The older version of Graham is wonderfully voiced by veteran actor Christopher Lloyd, and the range of his voice work here is at once staggering and impressive. It works best during the little puns and jokes the elder Graham sneaks in to explain away an accidental death or repeated failed attempts at interacting with an object, and the surprising number of variations in such cases are rewarding enough to stave off the weary repetition of experimentation in the point-and-click puzzle-solving segments. Conversations and cutscenes are annoyingly unskippable, though (I only wanted to avoid them when I’d already heard them, but had to go back to pick up hints I’d missed.)   To their great credit, none of these puzzles are particularly hard or guilty of absurd “adventure game logic” that forces you to randomly try everything on everything else to progress, and the ones that did stump me seemed painfully obvious after I completed them. Again, you’re on your own: no clues pop up that you're supposed to use this or that object with this or that NPC, and to use it or hand it over you'll have to select the object from your inventory after the dialog is over. It seemed awkward at first, but I later realized that much of the challenge and experience would be lost with any kind of hints. Also, everything is gorgeous. There's an echo of The Banner Saga's homages to Eyvind Earle in young Graham's character design, and his red cloak flutters realistically as he shifts directions and hops over obstacles. Hand-painted backgrounds stretch far into the distance while detailed 3D models with painterly textures fill the foreground. There's hardly an environment in the whole story that doesn't evoke some awe. That makes the business of getting around and experimenting with objects you've encountered in the world a pleasurable experience. Time spent roaming around, of course, is a staple of the genre, and it's important to note that King's Quest doesn't even allow quick travel. Early on this doesn’t matter much, as the necessary items to advance the story are rarely more than three screens away from the objects they belong to. However, when I reached the midgame, in which Graham undertakes one of his first major challenges against the other knights, he spends too much of his time trotting back and forth between screens as he tries to hunt down several objects and find others to interact with, and load times in this segment are brief but annoyingly frequent. Ultimately, though, I can't say it bothered me that much. While Graham does venture away from the tournament, he never goes too far, and time and time again I was surprised to discover something I'd missed on previous walkbys, which kept that time from feeling wasted. Old-school adventure game mechanics make a great return to form in King's Quest: A Knight to Remember. This tale is funny, beautiful, and challenging enough to make up for a few plodding quests and frequent load screens, and it maintains its personality from start to finish, sprinkling the first episode of its story with happy highs and tragic lows.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	 There’s a little over an hour’s worth of missions in the first DLC for Batman: Arkham Knight. The whole of Batgirl: A Matter of Family is spent roaming one of Gotham City’s seemingly dozens of creepy abandoned amusement parks on another dark and stormy night that happened back when The Joker was still alive and Barbara Gordon still wore a cape and mask. It’s hard not to be disappointed that this is all that’s here, because while Batgirl’s debut is reasonably well done, it’s so self-contained and limited that if you blink you’ll miss it.  As with all the other playable characters in the Arkham games, Batgirl fights very much like her mentor, except with fewer gadgets at her disposal. She’s Batman-lite, effectively. She has unique combat animations which are every bit as cool as the other Arkham characters, and her remote-hacking tool can work from further away than Batman’s (to represent Barbara Gordon’s superhacker skills), and is frequently used to activate distractions and traps before diving into combat. Otherwise combat is business as usual. The first moments are tightly linear, as Batgirl and Robin (Tim Drake, not Jason Todd - a missed opportunity for a pre-Arkham Asylum prequel to show him in his sidekick days) punch thugs in a handful of sidekick fights and make awkward small talk that hints at their future romance. They’re not awkwardly charming, just awkward: “I want to tell you something… oh, nevermind.” Then the map opens up to a small open-world hub similar to the Ace Chemicals section of Arkham Knight, with multiple hostages you can rescue in any order. That freedom isn’t exactly meaningful, but it does allow Batgirl to spread her wings and glide a bit. A Matter of Family puts a few decent spins on traditional Arkham tasks, such as bombs with ticking timers and the ability to knock out the lights to blind armed goons. There’s a heavy emphasis on Batgirl’s hacking tool, which makes her predator fights feel at least slightly distinct – she can’t initiate a Fear Takedown without first “scaring” thugs with an activated trap or trick. There are some notably great-looking scenes, such as rescuing hostages from a fast-moving ferris wheel in a moderately tough Predator mode battle, and the sea-monster-themed areas of the park are distinctive. Plus, we get to see The Joker in the flesh, and Harley Quinn in her original Batman: Animated Series costume. Joker’s motivations for going after Batman’s sidekicks makes demented sense, which at least gives this story some interesting context. On the other hand, the final fight is a simple brawl with Joker, Harley, and their gang with a QTE finisher, which doesn’t feel appropriate for the Clown Prince of Crime’s MO or anything special gameplay-wise. What’s really disappointing is that we’re given virtually no means of enjoying Batgirl after the short campaign is completed. There are things that appear to be collectables scattered around the amusement park, like balloons you can pop with Batarangs and Joker-themed Jack-in-the-boxes, but it’s a small area, so finding them isn’t much of a challenge even if you’re into collectathons. Worse, there’s no new AR challenge map where you can play as Batgirl, which means her great-looking character model is trapped in this single piece of story content. Considering Arkham Knight is fairly stingy in the challenge map department, that’s another big missed opportunity. Batgirl: A Matter of Family has a decent story, an impressive setting, and some respectable brawls and Predator fights, but it’s all so disappointingly brief and self-contained. There’s nothing meaningful to do after this roughly one-hour story chunk is complete except to roam the small area beating on respawning thugs for no reason. There’s just not enough here to get excited about.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	 After taking 2014 as a gap year, EA Sports’ PGA Tour series has returned with a new cover athlete, a rebuilt game engine, and a more flexible approach to its control system. Unfortunately far too many concessions appear to have been made in order to accommodate these changes, and with its flimsy career mode, malnourished roster of licensed players and courses, and a glaring absence of fundamental game types, Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is a disappointing release that just barely manages to make the cut.  It’s a shame too because Rory McIlroy PGA Tour gets off to a great start. The Prologue that opens the game does an excellent job of introducing the three new control systems. You’re given the option of choosing between a classic ‘three-click’ swing timer, and two variants on the more contemporary analogue thumbstick-based setup – one a simplified system augmented with arcade-style power boosting and aftertouch spin controls, the other a more realistic method with all assists turned off and a more sensitive reception to the aim and velocity of your swing. I especially like how you can heavily customise each of the three mechanics to suit your own skills; I ended up settling on the latter more realistic setting only with the putting path aid toggled on (because my short game is terrible). This is a golf game that allows the player to effectively determine their own handicap, as opposed to 2014’s The Golf Club which had a more unrelenting focus on serious simulation. The Prologue also introduces you to the new Frostbite 3 engine-powered courses, which look appreciably superior than the links of the last generation – even if some of the textures are a little flat and a lot of the course features tend to pop in around the path of the ball’s flight. The new open world nature of each course also eliminates the load times between holes, and means poorly placed shots can now be played from out of bounds rather than just incurring an automatic stroke penalty as before, which adds to the realism. However it’s not long after the game’s opening – an exciting race to first place in the dying stages of the US Open interspersed with insightful words from McIlroy himself – that the cracks begin to show. From the very first glance at the game’s main menu it’s clear that Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is substantially light on features compared to the last gen Tiger Woods games. Stacked up against the two-year-old Tiger Woods PGA Tour 14, the new game has roughly half the number of courses to play on, about a quarter of the licensed players to choose from (with both the Legends and the female LPGA players gone entirely), and a create-a-player tool that ditches the customary eyebrow shaping and body sculpting of the older game in favour of a handful of set templates that are almost guaranteed to look absolutely nothing like you. Things get even worse when you step into the career mode. What should be the real meat of the single player experience is staggeringly undercooked. Gone is the steady rise to the PGA Tour via amateur competitions. Absent is the option of playing pre-tournament practice rounds to earn additional XP. Removed are the conditional objectives for fast-tracking your progress, such as winning a set number of tournaments in a season. Instead, you just get shunted from one tournament to another with no schedule to indicate what’s on the horizon beyond your next competition, and if you manage to win a tournament your prize is a static, text-based congratulations message with no trophy room to show off your spoils nor indication of how much prize money you’ve actually earned. Indeed it’s telling that the career mode defaults to a ‘quick round’ setting, reducing each tournament to a select handful of holes per round rather than the full four rounds of 18; it’s almost as though even the game knows you’ll want to get this over and done with as fast possible. Certainly if a professional career in golf was really this unrewarding and directionless, Rory McIlroy would probably have set his sights on a Masters in Accounting rather than the one in Augusta.  Outside of the career mode the feature cull continues. You can play with your friends both locally and online, but you no longer have the ability to start your own Country Club in order to help foster a community. Even worse, the only game types available to you both online and off are stroke play and match play. Standard alternate modes like Skins, Best Ball, Battle Golf or Bingo Bango Bongo? Features that have been standard issue for the series since Tiger Woods was still fresh faced and free from tabloid scandal? You can forget about them, and enjoy the memory of that hole in one you just aced because there’s no longer an in-game option of replaying it either. The only noteworthy addition to the PGA Tour experience is the Night Club Challenge, a power-up packed arcade mode that feels as though it was designed with a mobile gaming audience in mind, right down the the ‘three star’ score objectives for each of its holes. There are some 170 challenges on offer and plenty of exaggerated Mario Golf-style add-ons such as nitrous boosts and portals to keep things interesting. Yet while steering a ball through neon-lit checkpoints like a remote-controlled car might be fun, it’s certainly not golf. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour is solid enough out on the course but it’s just lacking too many of the series’ fundamentals to make it worthwhile for golf fans. Concessions are often made when sports games straddle the gap between console generations old and new, but considering the two year wait for a game that is only being released on current gen hardware, the rampant slash and burn of its feature set is particularly galling. EA Tiburon has managed to create a golf game with plenty of holes in it; just not the kind that fans will relish. Rory McIlroy PGA Tour’s tagline, ‘Golf without limits’, seemed enticing in the lead up to the game’s release. After experiencing everything this cut-down series reboot has to offer, the message just comes across as sarcastic.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	 Payday 2: Crimewave Edition for Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is, for the most part, the same great co-op heist game that came out almost two years ago on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC, plus the added benefit of expanded skill trees, more gear, and  the many other improvements and additions developer Overkill has piled on since launch. With them, Payday 2 has only gotten deeper and more playable, though it hasn’t gotten much better looking, and the bots that assist you when going solo are still useless.  The beauty of Payday 2 is in how completely it assumes the identity it’s chosen for itself. It’s totally a co-op crime-sim; not a cops-and-robbers-themed arena shooter, or a horde mode dressed up as a caper flick.  Its mechanics are so deep, and its structure so foreign compared to standard shooters, it can seem overwhelming when civilians are running every which way, your thermal drill is jamming up on your target bank vault, and police sirens are getting louder and louder in your ears. But it’s that chaotic start that gives Payday 2 such a powerful sense of progression. Once my four-man crew and I had developed our skills and arsenals to the point where we could take out security, control crowds, and get into and out of a vault in minutes, I felt as if I’d graduated from a band of clumsy thugs to a formidable crew of criminal masterminds. For more specifics on what made the original version so great, check out our 2013 PayDay 2 review. Payday 2: Crimewave Edition builds on these strengths in a number of significant ways. The inclusion of a fifth skill tree, focused on survivability and evasiveness, makes a number of new character builds possible, including a dodge-based one that makes you extremely tough to hit. A wealth of new weapons and mods are also included, and Payday 2’s rich weapon attribute system allows all of them to differentiate themselves effectively. Whether you want an easily concealed silenced pistol or a bulky bullet-hose that scares civilians into submission with its throaty report, Crimewave Edition has a gun for you. Aside from an expanded armory and skill tree, there’s also a bunch of quality-of-life and balance changes that have been made. Seemingly little things, such as being able to move hostages around or being able to hack into ATMs with an ECM jammer, make interactions that used to feel clunky easier to get use out of. Given how much has been fixed or fiddled with, it’s really too bad nothing has been done to address the state of AI teammates. Sure, Payday 2 is a multiplayer-focused game, but it provides a way to play solo with three bots – and if the option is there, it shouldn’t be a bad way to play and practice. Sadly, it is. Bots still physically cannot interact with objectives of any kind, making many missions practically unplayable. Need to grab four bags of money from a vault and out into a van? Have fun running back and forth four times, since your AI teammates can’t touch ‘em. It just doesn’t make any sense that in an objective-based game, the AI is physically incapable of playing said objectives. It’s also odd that the PS4 and Xbox One versions are both locked at 30 frames per second. Payday 2 wasn’t nearly on the bleeding edge of graphics tech when it originally came out on the old generation of consoles, and it definitely shows its age here, especially indoors where environments look flat and angular throughout. Its more aggressive lighting effects help pretty it up a bit compared to the old PS3 and Xbox 360 versions , but on the whole, there’s nothing here to convince me that locking the framerate at 30 was a necessary sacrifice.  That said, visual appeal was never the reason to play Payday 2; its tactical depth is. Crimewave Edition delivers here in a big way, both because of all the new skills and gear, and because of the addition of the pre-planning function for many missions, which allows you to call in favors and spend cash in exchange for camera access, support snipers, and a number of other mission-specific assistance that can help you mold the perfect caper. It’s a useful, logical extra layer of depth for a game that already had plenty. That depth expresses itself most fully online when playing with three friends or strangers, though the Xbox One version is having some difficulty there. Getting into a match and maintaining a stable enough connection to see missions through to the end was too much to ask at times, where I didn’t run into such issues on PS4. Overkill is aware of the situation, and has worked to rectify it, but in my experience, the PS4 version was the better online experience. Though it doesn’t exactly put the added power of the PS4 and Xbox One to full use, Payday 2: Crimewave Edition is the best-looking console version of Payday 2 you can get, and the best value on any platform for obtaining its wealth of downloadable content. It’s mildly disappointing to see the framerate capped, and that bots are still in the same state after all this time, but Payday 2’s deep mechanics and purity of vision still make it one of the best, yet most overlooked multiplayer games you can play today.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	 When we reviewed the most recent PC iteration of Devil May Cry 4 back in 2008, we gave it an 8.0, for Great. Here’s what we said: “So are you going to enjoy Devil May Cry 4? Hardcore actions junkies aren't going to care as much about the wrap-around level progression and repetitive encounters as they'll likely be busy replaying stages for the highest ratings. They're going to love the punishing Legendary Dark Knight mode on Turbo and power through the wonky platforming and puzzle sections. If you're one of those who are just looking for a one-shot action experience, though, you'll probably be more affected by these kinds of flaws.  Regardless of how much weight you put on each category, the action gameplay is accessible and possesses quite a bit of depth if you're willing to put in the time. The higher-resolution graphics on the PC shine and flow smoothly, and the fact that a gamepad is the best way to go shouldn't turn you off. This type of game couldn't really work any other way. So while it's not without flaws, it's still one of the better pure action experiences on the platform.” The same holds true of Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC. This updated version brings the 1080p graphics and 60-frames-per-second gameplay to consoles for the first time, alongside a trio of new playable characters. The sharper look and snappier feel is a satisfying upgrade for this old-school Dante adventure. Sadly, this Special Edition isn’t special enough to fix the gaping backtracking and puzzle flaws of the original 2008 release, but it’s a fun treat for anyone who prefers the classic combat of Devil May Cry before Capcom rebooted the series in 2013. The new characters and their combat styles are the single best reason to own DMC4: Special Edition. Each one presents a fun set of options that don’t feel like reskins of existing characters. Trish is fast, fluid fighter that straight up demolishes her opponents with a mix of close and mid-range attacks options. Her quick, graceful style is a great counterbalance to Lady, a much slower character whose rocket launcher, shotgun, pistol, and melee attack combinations pack quite a wallop.  But of the three, Vergil is perhaps the most interesting, in that he’s a deadly mix of devastating speed and deliberate action. His focus meter rewards careful play and, in a way, pushed me to play a more conservative role than any other action game I’ve played. Sure, I could swing my samurai sword willy-nilly and find some success. But, by carefully measuring my opponents, dodging, and counterattacking, I could tap into his true potential and really wreck the enemy with beefed-up attacks. A fighting style that emphasizes economy of motion isn’t common to Devil May Cry, a series where hacking something to death is often encouraged as paramount to success, but this is a fun direction I hope Capcom explores in future sequels. The fact that you can respec a character’s moveset at any time is great, too – if Capcom was going to pull any forward-thinking feature from the rebooted DMC, I’m glad it was this one. Where the new characters aren’t so well integrated is the haphazard way they’re oddly stitched into the story, with a noticeable lack of interstitial cutscenes. As you tour through the strange world of DMC4 with the new characters, you’ll encounter a boss or special enemy with next to zero fanfare. These cutscenes used to be the best reward in the original game, but without them, DMC4: Special Edition is like playing a remix of your favorite album only to discover some of the best song lyrics somehow went missing. And then there’s all the backtracking through levels and terrible board game puzzle section near the end. I wish Capcom had found a way to snip out or replace these low points to learn from the mistakes of the past and give fans a way to experience the good without the bad, and introduce new players to only the best of DMC4, but no, they’re still here. My best advice is just to stick it out and play on through, because it gets much better. Beyond the nice upgraded graphics and framerate, Devil May Cry 4: Special Edition puts all of its energy into adding three great new characters and fighting styles to Capcom’s over-the-top action game. Trish, Lady, and Vergil are the best reasons to pick up this special edition, and they’re playable in every mode. It’s a bit disappointing that Capcom didn’t take this opportunity to delete the bad points while adding in new good stuff, which means that the backtracking and annoying puzzles that pushed some people away in 2008 will do so again in this edition.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	 [Editor's Note: Heads up: the PC version of Batman: Arkham Knight is experiencing major performance issues at launch.] Arkham Asylum, the first Batman game from Rocksteady Studios, had the sense of a fresh beginning for superhero action games. Batman: Arkham Knight has a sense of finality. It builds on the revolutionary strike-and-counter fighting style with powerful new moves  and enemies; it expands on Arkham City’s open world with a larger, more detailed version of Gotham; it introduces a new fully playable Batmobile and makes it an important part of the action and puzzles; and it brings all of Batman’s closest family of Gotham superheroes and rogues together for an amazing, great-looking finale.  Roughly 12 hours’ worth of story missions do a great job of playing up the long history between Batman, the three Robins, and Jim and Barbara Gordon. The plot does stray a little too far into the supernatural for my tastes -- in that I generally find the Dark Knight at his finest when the threats he faces are at least remotely grounded in reality -- but in doing so it drives wedges between allies and delves into Batman’s psyche in an interesting way. While the mystery of the identity of the Arkham Knight (a militarized anti-Batman who serves as co-antagonist along with the Scarecrow) fizzles out, there are other surprises to fall back on that kept me engaged in the twisting story. Plus, several strong performances gave it personality: the unsettling monotone voice of John Noble makes this the eeriest version of the Scarecrow yet, Mark Hamill returns for some excellent, darkly hilarious posthumous Joker lines and reenactments of some of the most famous scenes from the comics, and of course the definitive Kevin Conroy stars as Batman. Here and there a few cheesy, wooden lines pop up, mostly in the side quests, but the same is true of nearly any game of this size. And its size is significant. We’re now free to explore three islands of the dark and intermittently stormy Gotham City, which is given character and color by its many bright neon lights and noticeable landmarks like the Chinatown district, Wayne Tower, and Ace Chemicals. All of which are beautifully detailed, and the lighting effects reflecting off wet streets and capes highlight impressive texture detail. The city has been evacuated again, which conveniently makes it impossible to accidentally or intentionally beat up innocents, but the streets are far livelier than in past games thanks to vastly increased populations of criminals, both on foot and engaging in high-speed pursuits with Gotham Police cars. (The animation you get from countering them when they try to run you down is hilarious.) Notably, we don’t return to the Batcave in Arkham Knight, which is fine by me considering how much time was spent there in the past two Arkham games.  With the new moderately large open world comes improved transportation. Not only can you cape-glide much faster thanks to an upgradable grapnel, but we’ve also got the rocket-powered, transforming Batmobile, which is to the streets of Gotham City as the Kool-Aid Man is to brick walls. Nearly everything in your path crumbles in a satisfying way as you chase down criminals, and we get some impressive slow-motion explosions out of the simple vehicular combat. (Remember: Batman doesn’t kill, so we can assume everyone walks away from these fiery wrecks. The same goes for the thugs you run over in the street, who are both hit by a car and electrocuted.) These were the only moments I noticed the framerate dip a little, and it wasn't by much. The Batmobile can also be remote-controlled, which makes it a great addition to Batman’s environmental puzzle-solving toolbox. Need to be in two places at once to trigger two switches, or to sneak up on enemies who’ve got you cornered? No problem. And it can be summoned almost anywhere outside, leading to a fantastic move where Batman dives in as it zooms to him. The twist is that when you hold the left trigger, the Batmobile swiftly turns into a slower but highly maneuverable tank that you use to blow up battle drones. That’s... weird. On one hand, this is about as un-Batman an activity as I can imagine. He’s a hero known for using his fists, his non-lethal gadgets, and his wits to defeat criminals because his parents were murdered by a gun, and yet here he is, a knight in futuristic armor blasting away with guns galore. (They automatically switch to non-lethal ammo when targeting humans.) Rocksteady’s obviously aware of this, since more than one character comments on how it’s not exactly his style.  On the other hand, tank battles are good fun -- the idea of having hostile drones project a visible line of fire where they’re about to launch a shell gives you awareness of enemies attacking from all sides and lets you avoid them, and it gets tough when heavy and flying drones are introduced and you’re given secondary weapons, such as EMPs and missile barrages, to counter them. True, tank battles are nowhere near as interesting or replayable as the improved brawling and predator-style fights, but adding this third mode of combat to Batman’s repertoire does great things for pacing and variety, ensuring we’re never doing the same thing for long. Tank mode plays a big role in puzzles, too, thanks to a grapnel winch that pulls things down for you. Tank-based platforming puzzles are the one place where the Batmobile feels like a bad idea. They’re only slightly more fun than they sound like, because while it’s maneuverable and can strafe, driving up a narrow ramp is still frustratingly clumsy. Also, take note: both driving and tank combat became much more enjoyable when I switched the controls from the counter-intuitive default scheme to the more natural toggle mode, where you don’t have to hold the tank button down and the left trigger brakes (as every other driving game has taught us it should) instead of transforms. Find that in the Game Options menu, and thank me later. [Edit: Note that you have to reach the GCPD garage before you can enable this option. For some reason it doesn't show up at all until then.]  Meanwhile, Batman’s signature strike-and-counter brawling and stealthy predator fights feel better and smoother than ever, and of course they’ve been upgraded with dozens of powerful and interesting new mechanics and subtle tweaks that give us more to experiment with and master. Some of the new moves feel overpowered at first. In brawls you can pick up a dropped baseball bat or club, which gives you a few seconds’ worth of bashing through shielded or shock-baton-wielding enemies, and in predator fights the surprise multi-takedown move that knocks out up to five unsuspecting targets at once and the voice synthesizer gadget that can lure thugs into traps in predator fights both chew through thugs very quickly. But the increased number of enemies in play and new types, like the huge gatling-gun brutes and a medic who can protect his allies with electric fields (which must be shorted out with the Bat Claw before you can hit them) and revive anybody you’ve already knocked out, balance it out well. Also, being hunted by thugs who use denial tactics like firebombing ground vents, controlling hovering drones, deploying landmines, and detecting you if you use Detective Vision for too long made me change up my habits and targeting priorities. A few flashy fight scenarios in the campaign and side missions let you team up with an AI-controlled Robin, Nightwing, or Catwoman, and use them to execute some awesome dual-takedown moves that knock out any enemy instantly and temporarily swap you to control of your partner (while maintaining your combo count). It doesn’t add much mechanically, but fighting side-by-side with a sidekick is a very Batman thing to do. These climactic showpiece fights let Arkham Knight get away with almost entirely dropping the gimmicky boss fights that ended up as low points of previous Arkham games. In a way it’s a let down that there’s no direct physical confrontation with most arch criminals, but nothing is sometimes better than something annoying.  The campaign is complemented by a ton of mostly excellent side quests built around stopping villains like Two Face, Penguin, and of course The Riddler. Each mission series has its own gameplay style -- Riddler, for instance, has a mix of his typical riddles and novel Batmobile race courses where you have to speed through while tapping a button to extend or retract pieces of track or obstructions moments before you plunge to your doom or crash and explode; Two-Face’s crew robs banks, putting a timed twist on predator fights; Man-Bat requires listening for his echolocation screams and then performing aerial takedowns. Some -- namely the Arkham Knight’s mercenaries who generally require beatings -- get a bit too repetitive if done one after the other, but mixing things up and doing missions as you find them is worth easily another dozen hours of variety-packed gameplay. And that’s before you even get to the addictive challenge fights -- which include racing and tank battles -- and a New Game +. If this is in fact the last Rocksteady-developed Batman game, the series will end on a high note. Arkham Knight is the biggest Batman game yet, not just in map size, but in the wide range of different types of gameplay, and its collection of characters. The addition of tank combat thematically clashes with everything Batman stands for, but it is fun, and having access to the Batmobile for the first time gives us a new world of possibilities for interacting with Gotham City. Arkham Knight is an outstanding game on almost every level.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	" If I had to pick a highlight of my time with the console versions of The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited, it would be the moment when I logged back into the PC version and realized I missed the subtle differences I enjoyed on the Xbox One. There's no doubt that the textures and overall graphics quality of the PC version are more impressive, but something about this massively multiplayer online roleplaying game feels a little more like its cousin Skyrim – in a good way. There's a touch of it in the closer, over-the-shoulder point-of-view, and I like how it mimics Skyrim's menus. In that moment, I realized I wanted to make the Xbox One my main TESO platform, despite having put months' worth of time into my PC version, and that’s the greatest compliment I can give it.  Granted, the launch week has been hounded by server instability and lag (that seems to be clearing up in the wake of a couple of patches), and I'm still not a big fan of the console versions' voice-only approach to socializing. But at the same time, The Elder Scrolls Online feels at home on the Xbox One and PS4, as though it were made for them from the start. Developer ZeniMax Online has generally done a good job of transforming it into one of the best MMORPGs currently available on consoles. It also doesn't eat at your wallet. TESO scrapped its subscription free earlier this year, which means you can play all of its content without having to pay a dime beyond the initial purchase price. There's a cash shop called the ""Crown Store,"" yes, but it largely focuses on cosmetic items like guar mounts and costumes, and you could get the few buffs it grants by cooking or buying player-made food. At no point should anyone who chooses not to use the Crown Store feel at a disadvantage. In fact, I'd say the Crown Store is disappointing compared to what you find in fellow buy-to-play MMORPG Guild Wars 2, as the costumes are usually dull and there's no option for much-required services like appearance or faction changes. I'd like to acknowledge that this is a relatively quick review for such a massive game. It took me close to 100 hours of to reach the level cap when I originally reviewed TESO on PC last year, but I've never really stopped playing in all the time since. Because the console versions really bring no new content that isn’t present in the PC version's latest patch, I've spent most of my time seeing how the same experience translates on the Xbox One and PS4 – and that experience has been a good one. I’ve seen no sign of the infestations of bugs and bots that marred the first months of the PC version, and earlier this year ZeniMax Online introduced some much-needed features that make the experience of playing Elder Scrolls Online feel more like, well, Elder Scrolls. You can now kill and pickpocket non-essential NPCs, for instance, which makes you a fugitive until you pay off your bounty, wait out the debuff, or get killed by guards. It's a fun system, and it's a shame there's currently no PvP component in which you're allowed to hunt down players with a penchant for theft and murder (but the rumor mill suggests that may come in a future patch). I've noticed, however, that the system makes goofing around a lot more precarious than in most MMOs. I'm of those mildly ADD players who's constantly slashing swords and jumping for no real reason, and I tend to keep the feature turned off as it greatly improves my chances of accidentally cleaving a peasant.  Such slip-ups are uncommon. For such a massive MMORPG — filled with a sprawling PvP zone, four-man dungeons, and 12-man raid-like Trials — TESO is uncommonly suited to gamepads because it doesn't burden you with a truckload of abilities, as does Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Here, there's only an action bar for five buttons, which you can extend to 10 by swapping weapons almost instantaneously beginning at level 15. It makes combat fun and fluid, and the option to manually block and slash with the left and right triggers respectively grants a sense of interactivity that's usually missing in MMOs. The benefits of playing with a gamepad especially show up in lockpicking, which always kind of annoyed me on TESO's PC counterpart, but here the rumbler helps me realize when the springs are at just the right position, thus resulting in fewer broken lockpicks. Alas, not everything works so well. While the mapping setup is generally intuitive, the Swap Weapon and Crouch/Sneak buttons feel like they should be swapped themselves. You'll currently find Swap Weapon mapped to the ""west"" button on the D-Pad, which is a pain when you're using the left thumbstick to run away and want to swap on the move. Sneaking is achieved by pressing in the right thumbstick — which would be a more effective mapping for in-combat actions like weapon-swapping.  The rest of the buttons belong to the action abilities, and that's where TESO best reveals its Elder Scrolls-like freedom. In contrast to almost every major MMO out there, you can use any weapon and any weight of gear you want with any of the four character classes, thus allowing for a wide range of custom playstyles. The only limits are the abilities associated with the class-specific abilities of the Dragonknight, Sorcerer, Templar, and Nightblade, which lend each one a useful combat personality with powers that range from leaping toward enemies with dragon wings as a Dragonknight or summoning Daedra as a Sorcerer. The upshot of all this is that you can be a heavy-armored sorcerer who wields a double-bladed axe if you so wish, so long as you level weapons and gear by wearing them in combat and while turning in quests. When I first reviewed TESO, this freedom was only a reality for the initial leveling process. That's all changed now thanks to the Champion Point system that appears once you venture past the nominal level cap of 50 and into the 14 ""Veteran Ranks,"" as you can put points into constellations that can affect factors such as the stamina cost of abilities or the power behind crits. There's essentially no cap on these, though, and I worry that they'll leave newer players hopelessly behind months after launch. For now, though, they've done much to fix one of TESO's most glaring stumbles for its longevity.  Exploring the world generally feels like playing a game like Skyrim, even though it breaks with the open-world tradition of Elder Scrolls by ushering you through zones in a linear fashion. These are massive areas, though, and they're filled with ad-hoc group activities such as world bosses or the comparatively ho-hum dark anchors that occasionally dropped down from the sky in fixed areas. After having experienced each of the three factions stories twice now, I'm convinced that which one you choose to play first could greatly affect your perception of how good TESO's storylines are. To this day, I love the Ebonheart Pact's mix of lightweight puzzles and slaying, and the way its basis in the unique settings of Morrowind and Skyrim does much to break its adventures out of standard fantasy expectations. On the other hand, The Daggerfall Covenant and its focus on the predictable kings and castles of traditional fantasy bores me to tears every time, even with a somehow disappointing jaunt into the Alik'r desert. The elfy Aldmeri Dominion makes a good showing, too... but if you'll pardon my preferences, it's a little too pretty for my tastes. That's all good for the a solitary, single-player-style experience, but nothing makes me worry about TESO's multiplayer future quite like its approach to communication. It's entirely based on Group and Area voice chat, the latter of which allows you to listen to jerks playing Carly Rae Jepsen in the middle of Riften or little kids squabbling over a can of Coke in Mournhold. That background noise doesn’t do much to immerse me in the fantasy atmosphere, and there's apparently no option to mute specific players. To be sure, there are a few areas where this system shines: Automatically forcing random dungeon groups to use voice chat instead of typing, for instance, has resulted in much smoother first-time dungeon runs than I ever saw in the PC version. When you're able to immediately describe the cause of a problem in combat without having to stop to type or read, there's a much smaller chance for error. This is also true in the sprawling PvP zone of Cyrodiil, where I was better able to lead small missions into enemy bases by speaking to random comrades rather than typing.  But here's the problem: there's no option to use text chat. At all. That means that, so far, it's almost impossible to get groups together in the group-focused endgame zone of Craglorn since you can't call out for more people in zone chat. That means it's hard to invite people to or join one of the five guilds, which especially sucks because guilds and the associated guild vendors throughout the world form the backbone of TESO's economy. It's even more annoying when playing PvP in Cyrodiil, as it's almost impossible to find out where the bulk of the fighting is upon entering aside from subtle hints on the map. Some form of text entry is essential for this type of game. Neverwinter and FFXIV: ARR both wisely let us use peripheral keyboards if we wished, and the latter even allows a wide range of pre-programmed text macros for console players to describe what they need. TESO has none, and I can't help but feel that its multiplayer experience will suffer for it. Perhaps it doesn't need to. I've discovered that I enjoy the console versions of TESO precisely because of their comparatively leisurely pace, and that pace has helped me uncover a touch of that Skyrim feeling I sometimes struggled to find on the PC. I've also, oddly, discovered that I appreciate that TESO on consoles allows no addons, as it encourages active Elder Scrolls-style exploration. Here, there's no voice at the back of my brain screaming that finding all those lorebooks and skyshards for ability points would be a lot easier with a plugin. Experimentation with alchemy is more fun, too, since I don't have an add-on that tells me all the right combinations. (But man, I sure do miss instant gear and ability swapping.) Were it not for the problems with communications — and ZeniMax's decision to make distracting gamertags visible in the world instead of lore-appropriate character names — I'd easily say this was the superior version of TESO. It's relaxed version of an feature-rich MMORPG that originally seemed meant to butt heads with the like of World of Warcraft, and here on on consoles, here on our couches — perhaps this is where it was meant to be all along. There's a ton of great content in The Elder Scrolls Online: Tamriel Unlimited waiting for solo and group-focused players alike, including crafting, PvP, four-man dungeons, and raid-like Trials at the endgame. The gamepad controls are pretty good, which makes the action-heavy combat work well from the couch. And except for some limitations from the voice-only communication system, it nails most of what I love about PC MMORPGs."
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	 The Evil Within’s final story DLC takes the main game’s survival-horror genetics and throws them away in favour of a more conventionally violent, first-person action experience. It’s an odd choice, considering stealthy challenge and originality were such highlights of The Evil Within, and while The Executioner is a fun and rather cathartic change of pace, it’s missing something special. The Executioner’s three-hour story places you in the shoes of The Keeper, The Evil Within’s wonderfully weird box-headed bad guy. But while you may look the part, you’re merely a man inhabiting a Keeper’s body, searching for your lost daughter inside The Evil Within’s multiple-consciousness system, STEM.  There’s an elegance to this storytelling. An ongoing issue I’ve had with The Evil Within is its tendency to cram exposition in where it’s not needed, breaking up the flow of the gameplay. But your Keeper is a silent protagonist, and goes about his business with single-minded focus and little interruption from the outside world. This gives the father/daughter story real room to breathe, and it’s to developer Tango Gameworks’ credit that I got a little choked up at the end. The means by which you pursue your daughter, however, is fairly unimaginative. Though the idea of playing inside The Evil Within’s world as a hammer-wielding maniac is a novel one, in practice you and your blunt hammer are overpowered against weak enemies, and the lack of challenge - without the visceral thrill of combos - grew dull in far less than three hours. It’s a problem made worse by structure, as The Executioner pits you from boss battle to boss battle with a focus on very basic melee combat. Even when one strongly suggested I switch up this technique to something a little more inventive, I found that bashing its head in was a far more effective means by which to get the job done. The Executioner at least offers a multitude of unlockable weapons for all this bloodletting. I enjoyed the upgrade system here, primarily because it offered a little variation in combat, though I would have preferred to have access to some of the more interesting weapons - I’m looking at you, rocket launcher - earlier. The world sets an appropriately bloody stage for carnage. The Evil Within has always reveled in viscera, but The Executioner takes things to a somewhat ridiculous level. Upgrading, for example, involves you plunging your hand into a safe full of guts, while you can ‘teleport’ from one spot to another by tearing your own head off in a single bloody jerk. It feels like Tango just threw up its hands here, and it adds a sense of fun to The Executioner. But without challenge in a horror game, is fun enough?  While there’s some catharsis to be found in The Executioner’s overabundance of violence, combat simply isn’t exciting or interesting enough to single it out from any number of first person horror games. A briefly entertaining addition to The Evil Within, then, but not an essential one.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/destiny-house-of-wolves-review-2	 Destiny’s first expansion, The Dark Below, was a painful lesson, but House of Wolves learns from its predecessor’s mistakes. It doesn’t fix Destiny’s story woes or its stingy loot system, but it does introduce new, sensible gear upgrade paths, a fun new campaign with a few surprises, and rewarding endgame activities, as long as you have an established group of friends to run them with.   House of Wolves feels insistent to get players to the new level cap quickly. New legendary gear drops at a high light level so players don’t have to spend too long chasing Bounties and experience points to level up. Weapons still require some investment, but not nearly as much as they did before. Unfortunately, this approach only applies to the new House of Wolves exclusive gear, and Destiny’s loot system still feels as miserly as it did before. Given the effort a weekly Nightfall Strike requires, the chance that it could gift you with 10 Strange Coins feels like a paltry reward. A welcome in-game drop, called Etheric Light, does allow you to ascend previously acquired gear to the new damage threshold, but in typical Destiny fashion, it seldom drops in PvE. Speaking of PvE, the short five mission campaign is fun while it lasts, sporting well-designed encounters that add some fresh gameplay twists. For instance, the new Heavy Pike sets the campaign off with a blast - its side-mounted mine launchers are invaluable when taking on a Spider Tank head-on while hordes of enemies dog your flanks. The new Strike, “The Shadow Thief,” is arguable HoW’s crown jewel, with a novel boss battle that ends up stretching out over the better part of an entire map. Still, outside of livelier performances by characters Petra Venj and Variks, there’s not a lot of plot here, so don’t expect any storytelling miracles. The other piece of House of Wolves’ PvE is Prison of Elders, a fun wave-based activity that suffers slightly from lack of objective variety. For instance, there’s not a big difference between shooting mines and standing over them to disarm them. The higher level bosses at levels 33 and 34 spice things up considerably though. One forces your team to stay off the ground for a period of time while he burns the stage with rage, demanding strong communication and teamwork. It’s not as impressive as a new raid, which House of Wolves notably lacks, but it’s unique enough to stand on its own merits. The bigger blow though, is that the gear rewards seem insubstantial compared to the gear obtained from PvP. Expert PvP players have a lot to look forward to in House of Wolves though, thanks to Trials of Osiris, a hardcore 3v3 elimination mode that rewards top performers handsomely with great gear and weapons. A scorecard tracks your team’s record, and at three losses, you’re forced to cash out. Within a round, you can’t respawn on your own, so if you go down, you’re completely reliant on your teammates to get you up and fighting again, a fact your opponents will use against you. It’s tense, tactical, and the generous rewards for a perfect 9-0 run make it feel totally worthwhile.   House of Wolves wisely eliminates the worst parts of The Dark Below by offering a faster method to level gear, a better campaign, and varied endgame activities, assuming you have a regular crew to partake of them with. If you don’t, expect to get a lot less out of this expansion, but overall, it’s still a step in the right direction for Destiny.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	" The first thing I did in Life Is Strange -- Episode 3: Chaos Theory was check for texts from mom – it’s what I would have done in Max Caulfield’s shoes, and I was relieved to see a perfect string of sympathetic, loving texts with her mother. After that, Max comforted her devastated friends, pondered her existence alone after curfew, and commiserated with her close friend, Chloe. The events of Life is Strange -- Episode 2: Out of Time’s finale weigh heavily on Max’s shoulders, and Episode 3 shows how deeply they affect this cast of increasingly likable characters. Life Is Strange’s greatest success is in how grounded its world is, despite Max’s mysterious time-rewinding powers and the imminent end of the world. Episode 3 gives us time to breathe after Episode 2’s intense drama, but it finishes with something similarly bold. By the end of Episode 3, developer Dontnod takes an enormous and ambitious risk that succeeds in not only setting the story on a strong new path that broke my heart, but also left me ecstatic for Episode 4.  Episode 3 is where Life Is Strange finally makes the most of Max’s time-rewinding powers. Each time I think Dontnod has reached the limits of what the skill can do, it introduces something new or better. Verbal puzzles see Max learning secrets, going back in time, and leveraging the information against someone before they ever reveal it. I learned a lot about people I like and others I don’t, and my perspective toward some of them changed. Life Is Strange is so effective at humanity that I’m becoming more willing to overlook some of the imperfect performances and dialogue – partially because the dialogue writing is finally coming into its own and delivering on this story’s potential, and partially because I’m enthralled by these people regardless of their hilarious and continued overuse of the word “hella."" Environmental puzzles function similarly, and are bigger and more involved than in previous episodes. I enjoyed exploring Max’s school, the Blackwell Academy, after hours to find a build a DIY pipe bomb – despite its fetch-quest nature, it allowed Max time to monologue, giving me more insight into her state of mind, her thoughts on her friends and classmates, and how she’s dealing with the fallout of Episode 2. Using the explosive to blast a path open, entering a room, and then rewinding before a time the bomb was ever built makes Max feel powerful. In Episode 3, her odd gift no longer feels like a gameplay gimmick. It’s becoming something she understands – just in time for her to discover a new element of it she can’t comprehend. At the same time, while rewinding conversations, events, and major choices is the primary makeup of Life Is Strange, with these puzzles filling in the gaps between them, the power may running out of steam. I didn’t undo a single choice in this episode, because it didn’t feel necessary. The creative opportunities for rewinding time seem exhausted by now. Perhaps future episodes will prove me wrong, but Episode 3’s introduction of a significant change to Max’s abilities indicates a big shift for what she can and will do going forward. She’s able to travel farther back in time than ever, and the butterfly effect on the world is much larger than even Episode 2’s outstanding consequences. It weakens the importance of my control over the moment, because the moment feels less important than the bigger picture Max is gaining hold of. Because of this meddling with the past, Episode 3 rebuilds the world around Max. I’m intrigued about its new direction, and excited to see where she takes it next – and how her small-scale time-rewinding skills relate to the more expansive abilities she’s earned by the end. This episode leaves Max more lost, confused, and hurt than ever, and I feel awful for her and those hurting around her. When Episode 4 opens, and everything around Max is (presumably) different than she or I ever imagined, the first thing I’m going to do is check for texts from her mom. Click for all episode reviews of the game Life is Strange. Life is Strange: Episode 3 - Chaos Theory doesn’t bring many major moral choices to the table, but it doesn’t matter – Max’s evolving time-travel power is growing into something bigger and scarier than she ever expected. This episode poses interesting philosophical dilemmas instead: How far is too far? What is the cost of saving a life? Should anyone be allowed to have this power at all? The people at the center of this story are so engaging that I’m starting to outright ignore awkward dialogue, because the emotional gravity of its storytelling is so much stronger than the irregular out-of-place line or questionable dialogue delivery."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	 Unlike its predecessor, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt doesn't exactly come screaming off the starting line. Compared to The Witcher 2, where you're immediately plunged headlong into a sexy story of intrigue and betrayal, this main quest can seem mundane, even perfunctory at times. But each time I stepped off the well-beaten path to blaze my own trail, it turned into a wild, open, exhilarating fantasy roleplaying experience, rife with opportunities to make use of its excellent combat. Even after over 100 hours with The Witcher 3, it still tempts me to press on – there’s so much more I want to learn, and hunt.  The Witcher 3 is as dense and deep as the other two games in the series in terms of RPG mechanics, and the overwhelmingly massive open-world environment has at once made that depth more intimidating, and in the long run, more rewarding. It’s difficult to express just how huge and open this world is: verdant, rolling fields liberally dotted with swaying foliage of every shape and size fill the space between loosely connected, ramshackle townships where people struggle to scrape by. A full day/night cycle and dynamic weather pull it all together, cementing The Witcher 3’s landscape as one of the most authentic-feeling open worlds I’ve ever seen. A handy minimap points you where you want to go, which might seem like a crutch, but honestly, without it, I’d have been hopelessly lost. That a world this size still feels so purposeful, and full of things to do is quite an achievement. The one caveat on all that though, is the technical performance on both the Xbox One and PS4 versions. 30 frames per second was sometimes too much to ask, transitions between The Witcher 3’s two main maps are just a bit too long, and minor glitches do pop up from time to time. None of it ever impacted gameplay in any meaningful way, though it did compromise the beauty of the experience ever so slightly. Thankfully, PC players can expect a lot more. On a GTX 980, Witcher 3 ran at 60 frames per second at all times on ultra settings. This new open-world map obviously has ramifications for the structure of the story, and though there are flashes of greatness, the main story is ultimately the least fulfilling part of The Witcher 3. You might call it another case of The Elder Scrolls Syndrome. Our tale begins as a multi-continent search for Geralt’s long-lost lover Yennifer, and Ciri, his surrogate daughter. My single biggest issue though, is that it never becomes much more: the overly long main story is essentially just Geralt running errands for people in exchange for information on Ciri’s whereabouts. It effectively maintains focus and momentum, but it feels more like a wild goose chase than an intriguing mystery to unravel, like the one we got in Assassins of Kings. Thanks to lots of excellent dialogue and voice acting there is some emotional payoff along the way, but it’s mixed in with too much padding in the form of meaningless fetch quests and collectathons. Every time I felt like I was on the verge of an interesting revelation, I’d have to suddenly stop to escort a goat, or search for a lost, narcoleptic dwarf. Heck, even Geralt can barely hide his frustration with the constant parade of menial tasks at times. It’s also worth noting that though you will get along fine without playing the first two games in the series, without the context provided by the Witcher novels, Ciri is more or less a complete stranger until the last quarter of the journey, which made it difficult to care about finding her as much as The Witcher 3 expected me to – especially given the slew of intriguing characters who are relegated to supportive background roles.   Thankfully, they all get chances to shine once you venture off the beaten path, and that’s where The Witcher 3 gets nearly everything incredibly right. Depending on your decisions in The Witcher 2 (which can be handily recreated via some dialogue early in the game), you’ll see lots of familiar faces returning to play a role in Geralt’s search, and once they have, they offer you a secondary line of quests that typically provide far more interesting scenarios to dabble in. Underground turf wars, assassination plots, love triangles, and unexpected alliances are all part of these optional romps. They’re all so meaty and full of rich story content that they feel like they should have been part of the main story. The same can be said for a lot of the side quests you pick up in the field as well. Aside from the bevy of standard side-quests, monster lairs, and bandit camps generously littered about The Witcher 3’s gargantuan land mass, you also get a bunch of monster-hunting Witcher contracts to persue. Geralt's quarry ranges from ethereal wraiths that need to be made tangible before you can harm them, to Foglets who conceal themselves in thick smog, waiting for a chance to strike. The payoff here is twofold: in keeping with the lore, these represent your most reliable stream of income, which is refreshingly significant due to an appropriately stingy in-game economy.  The other upside is that, more often than not, these hunts and other side activities provide interesting insights into a land being destroyed by war, and the many forces that play a role in shaping it. Best of all, you’re one of those forces. It may not shift the main story’s conclusion in monumental ways, but I often returned to places I’d visited earlier to find that a seemingly small decision played out in a very big way. There is no morality meter, no paragon or renegade rating. In the grayscale world of The Witcher 3, there is only cause and effect; the decisions you make, both big and small, can legitimately change the world around you – far more so than most games that make similar claims. Character progression and equipment choices are equally impactful. Relative to The Witcher 2, I found that Witcher 3’s RPG systems have been streamlined in some ways, and made more complex in others. In both cases though, the result is the same: a better experience. Simplifications to how you restock and use potions and oils makes them feel more practical and immediately useful, as you no longer need to meditate to do any of it. Sure, the old way was more in keeping with Witcher lore, but in a wide open world, it makes less sense to expect players to predict and prepare for everything they might come across in advance. On the flip side, there’s a wider variety of powerful, interesting potions than ever, including those that greatly enhance mounted combat, and others that restore health as you cast spells (or Signs as Witchers call them).  Speaking of Signs, they’ve been improved across the board with alternate casting modes, and a wider variety of upgrades, making them impactful in every fight. It’s actually entirely viable to build a sign-focused Geralt. I played him a lot like a Jedi actually, able to influence people’s minds in conversation, a powerful long range “force” push, and the ability to reflect crossbow bolts back to the sender (a returning ability that’s been made far more usable). The new skill system provides a good deal of flexibility while still rewarding players who want min/max for the best builds, and weapon and armor crafting is as deep and nuanced as ever, if not more so. All of this shines through in The Witcher 3’s responsive, brutal real-time combat. Where combat in this series has up until this point felt vague and even a bit clunky, here it’s so fluid and satisfying that I walk around hoping for bandits to jump me just so I can repel their attacks with magical barriers, parry their blows with uncanny precision, and relieve them of life and/or limb with the occasional gory flourish. The Witcher has always done a great job of making me feel that I’ve outsmarted my foes, but for the first time here, controlling Geralt feels tangibly badass with every successful fight.  Though the straightforward and fetch-quest-heavy main story overstays its welcome, the option of joyfully adventuring through a rich, expansive open world was always there for me when I’d start to burn out. Even if the plot isn’t terribly interesting, the many characters who play a part in it are, and along with the excellent combat and RPG gameplay, they elevate The Witcher 3 to a plane few other RPGs inhabit.

Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	 Wolfenstein: The Old Blood is a strange beast. As a six-hour, stand-alone prequel to 2014’s excellent Wolfenstein: The New Order, it puts us through a grinder of tense, exciting, and memorable shootouts in some really great settings. But while The New Order shined brightest during its quiet moments of exploration and character development, The Old Blood never really gives you time to catch your breath during its descent to zombie-filled strangeness. That unrelenting pace makes it lots of fun, but not as thoughtful as its stand-out predecessor. Taking place during the late ‘40s, The Old Blood once again places you in the blood-soaked boots of B.J. Blazkowicz, back before he saved the world from Deathshead’s alternate-history evil. The story this time around has you infiltrating mountainside fortresses, escaping Nazi prisons, and fighting waves of zombies, but nothing about the story ever really felt memorable. Like so many entertaining but forgettable shooters before it, The Old Blood comes across more like an automated shooting range, most notable for presenting you with diverse locations to shoot all manner of baddies in. From the torchlit halls of Castle Wolfenstein to cryptic caves underneath burning villages, you briskly move from place to place, and encounter to encounter. While this speed keeps the action hot, I really did miss New Order’s surprisingly effective detours into character relationships, non-combat areas, and story. That felt brave and bold in a way this doesn’t.   In place of those palate cleansers, The Old Blood uses stealth puzzles that act as nice buffers to the action. Many of these have you sneaking around rooms and turning off electricity to hulking, tethered mechs, taking out sentry guards in heavily fortified areas, and using your all-purpose pipe weapon/tool to climb up walls and jimmy open doors. These scenes turn down the volume, but keep the tension high, as many enemies are able to tear you apart extremely quickly if you get caught. While checkpoints are generally plentiful across The Old Blood’s eight chapters, there were a few tough stealth sections where I managed to remain hidden for well over 10 minutes, only to be spotted within sight of my goal and frustratingly forced to repeat the whole thing over again. In addition to these scenarios, I really appreciated the various nods to other Bethesda-owned games peppered throughout The Old Blood. During my time in this alternate history, I spotted Fallout’s Nuka Cola, a Dragonborn helmet from Skyrim, and a pixilated model of Quake 3’s rocket launcher. When you do find yourself in combat, which I promise happens quite a bit, the scenarios are by and largely satisfying. Arenas are multi-level, filled with cover points, and peppered with secret passages. Each weapon, from the precise Bombenschluss to the room-clearing Kampfpistol, has a balanced use throughout the campaign. Managing scarce ammo, knowing which weapon to use on which type of soldier, and constantly surveying the surroundings for cues make these fights more interesting and satisfying than the typical run-and-gun. But while the weapons all feel good in their own right, none of them really do anything unique when it comes to genre. Shotguns, sniper rifles, and explosives act exactly as you’d expect from a shooter in 2015, and while that makes for some fun encounters, they don't really deliver any surprises. Apart from this, it was nice to see prototype versions of what would become standard enemies 20 years later in The New Order, like a janky version of the mechanical dog that stalked us back in 2014’s game.   That said, I’m disappointed that The Old Blood didn’t take the opportunity to fix some of New Order’s nagging issues, particularly the repetitive effort required to pick up items. I was already tired of hitting a button every time I want to grab health, armor, ammo, or a collectable when I got here, and Old Blood only exacerbates this problem by throwing even larger piles of items at you. There’s no reason you wouldn’t want to pick up everything, so the lack of streamlining this action definitely adds a layer of tedium. The other weird issue with The Old Blood is the bizarre tone shift from Nazi-killing and espionage to apocalyptic zombie horror that occurs about two-thirds of the way through the campaign. It might’ve felt justified if zombies were something more than dumber, bullet-spongier versions of regular enemies, but that’s all they are. They’re not scary, they’re not interesting. They’re just...there, being dumb zombies. Strategy and excitement definitely takes a hit in the final chapters, but the variety and action carry this short shooter through to the end. Wolfenstein: The Old Blood places almost all its bets on the intense combat carried over from the game that came before it. The weapons feel great, and the arenas are interesting and filled with opportunity for some strategic creativity. But by doing this, The Old Blood misses out on some of the quieter moments that made The New Order so special. The Old Blood doubles down on blood and guts, but in doing so sacrifices some of its heart.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/06/project-cars-review	 Project CARS isn’t for everybody. It’s a serious, deep, and demanding racing simulation for people who like their motorsport pure. There’s no pop punk soundtrack, or explosive takedowns, or generous rewinds. Developer Slightly Mad Studios set out to capture the experience of manhandling a real racing car around a long list of some of the world’s most famous racing circuits, and has thoroughly succeeded. Tough but satisfying and cruel but fair, Project CARS is a truly fantastic racing game with the potential to become a real force in the genre. It is, however, for anybody – and this is an important distinction. Project CARS is probably the most user-friendly racing sim I’ve ever played. Even a layman who wants to learn can delve into Project CARS and be able to find a series of settings and options that will massage it into an experience that suits them, because the list of things to tweak is frankly exhaustive. There’s a lot to admire here, from the incredibly authentic handling to its lavishly detailed cars and tracks and its potent sound, but I’m seriously impressed at just how malleable this game is.   Project CARS features all the typical crutches, from braking assistance to stability control, but the options keep coming. Don’t like where the on-screen track map sits on your HUD? Move it somewhere else. Do you play with a steering wheel peripheral and find it distracting to see an on-screen steering wheel too? You can delete the wheel from the dash. It’s exceedingly well thought out. What I like most, however, is the way Project CARS allows us to fine-tune the overall AI difficulty and race length before every single session. The AI operates on a slider from zero to 100, which gives you the freedom to find a sweet spot that matches your ability. Find yourself out-qualifying the pack by several seconds? Maybe dial the AI up a few notches until they’re on par with you. Settled on a satisfying level of challenge but need a little more race time on a short track to realistically challenge for top spot? Increase the amount of laps for this event. Racers like the Forza Motorsports series traditionally offer similar scope to increase or decrease the overall challenge before races, but the implementation here is markedly more elegant and nuanced. Project CARS is at its best with evenly matched opponent cars, where every overtake is a small victory and it may take a lap (or several) to set up for a pass, but if you prefer to feel like a hero and blast past the whole pack in two laps from last place on the grid you can do that too. You can ask Project CARS to be either of these extremes and it will instantly oblige. Low-level opponent AI is quite nervous off the start line but, in general, all opponents display good situational awareness and are satisfyingly aggressive without being total bullies. I’ve found myself tagged by passing cars only occasionally and, for the most part, opponents seem pleasingly adept at avoiding race incidents. On one occasion I was beaten by a jerk AI driver who (illegally) didn’t make his mandatory pit stop until the last lap of a race and won by passing the finish line in pit lane, but it’s otherwise mostly well behaved. The autodrive needs a little work though; on one occasion I got hung up against some kind of invisible barrier while stopping for tyres at Bathurst but as you don't have manual control during pit stops I couldn’t rectify it and had to quit the race.   Project CARS’ player-first philosophy extends to its meaty career mode too, which is divided across open wheel racing, touring and GT racing, and prototype racing. They key point of difference is that, while there are a series of tiers available in each to progress through, you can start your career wherever you’d like. Want to start in karts and work your way up through the various open-wheel racing leagues before you finally land a seat in the top LMP1 league? Not a problem. Rather go straight to the top? Also not a problem. Enjoying your stint in GT4? Re-sign for another season, and another. You don’t have to move up if you don’t want to. Start where you want, stay where you wish. It’s not entirely dissimilar to Codemasters’ Pro Race Driver games, and the more recent Grid Autosport; the idea is to simply earn drives with various racing teams. Offers for stints in upcoming race seasons from team principals will come through your career email; all you need to do is accept the one you want. The team provides the car, so there’s no need to grind for cash or purchase cars. You just need to perform as well as you can over the whole season. I like this as it properly tempted me to challenge myself, and there is a lot more satisfaction to be gleaned from a real dogfight to defend a top-10 finish in Project CARS than there is farming first place trophies for cash in other racing games.   You can also have multiple careers on the boil if you wish. I began my first career in a one-make Renault Clio championship and moved up to GT4 racing, but I wanted a crack at the Endurance racing and LMP1 racing, so I started parallel careers in both of these. The only rigid part of the career mode is the three career goals – Zero to Hero, Triple Crown, and Defending Champ – that are available for you to attain, but it’s entirely up to you whether you try to achieve them all or focus on one in particular (or none, I guess). A taste of other forms of racing outside your active career(s) is available by diving into Project CARS’ one-off race weekends. The individual race weekends differ from the events you enter during your career by allowing you to determine things like how the weather will change throughout the race. You can activate several weather “slots” and choose what will happen in each, as well as how fast the weather will shift. I ran into an odd glitch here in this mode that hasn’t occurred elsewhere; it seems to try and place two opponent cars in the same spot on the starting grid. It causes a bit of a fuss but it doesn’t ruin proceedings. You get a similar level of control when setting up online races. The online racing has seemed robust and reliable on track during testing, although there are some quirks in the race set-ups that have emerged that will need addressing. In one case, a player that had joined our session after the warm-up period was driving an LMP1 vehicle that drastically outclassed the GT3 cars the rest of us had to choose from in the lobby. It’s unclear to me why this was possible.   Project CARS is an extremely handsome racing game across PC, PS4, and Xbox One, but it’s the little touches I like most. The leaves whipped up in the wake of cars ahead of you. The shards of light stabbing through tree tops obscuring a low-hanging sun, or the bobble of the rubber marbles accumulating just outside the racing line as cars rumble past. That’s a subtle flourish only perceptible in replays but programmed in nonetheless. The effect of rain on windscreens isn’t as remarkable as it is in Driveclub (it isn’t sloshed around by the wiper blades or cornering/braking forces) but the weather effects overall are great, and the tracks look spectacular in the wet. It makes up for its minor shortfalls (the animated pit stops present in the pre-release builds have been removed for the moment) with some cool attention to detail elsewhere, like the ability to monitor your opponents’ section and lap times from the garage during qualifying sessions. Project CARS’ vehicles also ooze detail, and are certainly on par with the competition. The range of vehicles varies across a large number of categories, from GT cars, to Le Mans prototypes, to a smattering of tracks toys, hypercars, and classic racing cars. Most, but not all, are licensed models. I’m not quite as smitten with this vehicle roster as, say, the slightly more rounded selection curated for Grid Autosport, but I still found quite a lot to like about it, even though some of the categories are a little less populated than others (and Japanese marques are virtually unrepresented).   That said, the vehicles in Project CARS feel far, far more distinct from one another than the cars of Grid Autosport do. The difference between a purpose-built race car and a regular, road-going hatchback is expertly translated by Project CARS’ supremely capable handling model. The former feel light, agile, and grippy; they’re stable in corners, but when pushed to the brink they snap in an instant, and it takes a deft touch to rein them in. Road cars feel almost whale-like in comparison. Even a performance hatch like the Focus RS feels heavy and understeers like a pig when you try to wrestle it through bends. The effect is amplified tenfold with a steering wheel, but survives translation on a gamepad too, although I found it worthwhile to play with the controller filtering sensitivity and other settings to find a feel that suits best. Either way, forget the problematic input lag from Slightly Mad Studios’ previous racer (the otherwise underrated Shift 2: Unleashed). I will say I don't like the karts in Project CARS, though – they're just too frenetic for me. The important thing is Project CARS makes me feel like a racing driver, just like FIFA puts players on the pitch in their favourite football team. When my race engineer told me someone in my virtual pit crew had just fumbled a wheel nut in a particularly time-sensitive stop, seconds felt like hours – as they likely would to a real race driver. Exiting the pits after a botched stop is tricky; I wanted to curse and push hard to try and claw back some time, but was invariably on cold tyres. It’s not a good feeling; it’s annoying, actually. But it’s not like getting annoyed at a cheap glitch; it’s a simulation of the kind of pressure on a driver suffering the consequences of a pit lane mistake. It’s a new feeling, a realistic one – and it’s one I’ve never had before in a racing game. And that, I appreciate. Deep and demanding but incredibly user-friendly, Project CARS looks great, sounds fantastic, and feels even better. The action is ferocious and tactical, the weather effects are awesome, and it’s brimming with content to explore. This is real racing done right.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/23/the-evil-within-the-consequence-review	 A direct continuation of The Evil Within’s superb first story DLC The Assignment, The Consequence is torn between wrapping up a complicated story and delivering a stylish stealth experience. Thanks to gorgeous environmental design and great boss battles it's still a compelling experience, but it's also a disjointed one. As protagonist Juli Kidman is propelled by malevolent forces toward her fate, the team at Tango Gameworks have clearly rushed to tie up the first installment's loose ends. I continue to appreciate The Evil Within’s nutty psychological horror concept for what it is, but ghostly real-time flashbacks and encounters with Juli’s ominous boss are too frequent here, taking on an air of insistent - and lifeless - pantomime.   Their constant interruptions break up the tight stealth gameplay that was such a highlight in The Assignment. While Juli’s still without a weapon for most - but not all - of her journey, The Consequence struggles to maintain an air of tension while moving the story forward, and enemies, poised on precipices for a pre-determined shove or thrown carelessly beyond the obvious route, feel like an afterthought. More problematically, The Consequence struggles to know what to do with its Big Bad, Ruvik. Now something of an overexposed figure, his ‘all-seeing’ presence is mostly relegated to the clunky abstract in The Consequence, and one miserable sequence saw me lighting paintings of his face on fire in order to ‘break his demonic hold’. There is a fun to be had once Tango throws up its hands and gives Juli a gun later on in proceedings. She’s only a little stronger with a weapon in her hand - unlike The Evil Within’s tougher Sebastian, she is killed in two hits - so every bullet counts. A stealthy approach might have been more interesting, but it’s hard to deny the satisfaction of downing five enemies with five bullets in the chamber.  And fortunately, originality blooms elsewhere. The Consequence has some of the creepiest environments in The Evil Within to date; the series’ trademark askew camera angles and ghostly filters complement body-horror walls and narrow corridors. Tango has always enjoyed messing with time and space, and here its set-pieces shift in wonderfully bizarre - and disorientating - ways.  Of particular note are its boss battle arenas, which pulled the rug from under my feet so frequently I felt genuinely panicked; which is, of course, the point. It doesn’t hurt that these bosses are truly unnerving creations. Tango continues to be happy tapping into horror cinema - more specifically, Adrian Lyne’s hugely influential Jacob’s Ladder - and has riffed on the familiar to create new frights. While the terrifying ‘lamp lady’ returns here with style, one boss - in the throes of Lyne’s ‘judder’ effect - spooked me in a way no video game nasty has before or since. The gorgeous environments and ridiculous boss battles in The Consequence are among the best in the series, but an overabundance of exposition interrupts its flow too frequently. This is still a good entry in The Evil Within’s universe, but it falls short of its predecessor's greatness.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	" When I reviewed State of Decay on Xbox 360 on June 5, 2013, I gave it an 8.9 – the highest end of “great” on our scale without graduating to “amazing.” Here’s how I summed it up then: ""State of Decay’s ambition reaches farther than most $60 titles, so its value is unquestionable as a $20 download – especially given how it manages to successfully meet so many of its lofty goals. I spent about 12 hours in this Zed-infested world, and while I saw most of what’s there, I could’ve spent a few more hours exploring. And since I focused on melee weapons the first time, I fully plan to start another game with a gun-centric character...Decay belongs in the pantheon of great modern zombie games alongside Valve’s Left 4 Dead series and Telltale’s Walking Dead episodes.""   Coming back to it on the Xbox One for the Year One Survival Edition, I realized I’d forgotten how much I love State of Decay. It’s deep, raw, unforgiving, and even emotional -- all in the very best of ways. It’s neither a pure action game nor your typical open-world action-adventure. It is, in fact, a systems-based role-playing game with permanent (and sometimes far-reaching) consequences for your characters. You’ll need to manage: relationships with fellow survivors, your group’s resources, injuries to you and your group, your backpack weight, your influence, your fatigue, and more. That may sound like an intimidating list, but through an easily understood and managed interface (press up on the D-pad to access it anytime), Decay’s elements are intuitive and digestible. Year One Survival Edition also bundles in State of Decay’s two excellent expansion packs: Breakdown and Lifeline. Each tells a side story with a different gameplay angle: the former being a sandbox-emphasizing, challenge-oriented romp, and the latter letting you play from the perspective of the military -- a group at odds with the player in the primary campaign. Each is clearly meant to be played after you complete the main game, but it’s refreshing that neither is simply more of the same.  Unfortunately, being re-released on a more powerful console has not cured its technical and presentation-based ills like I’d hoped (and reasonably expected) it would. Clipping bugs, warping characters, and frame rate problems all still plague State of Decay on Xbox One. Even running in 1080p with higher-resolution textures and a few other minor cosmetic upgrades, Year One Survival Edition still very much looks like an Xbox 360 game. At least the annoying screen tearing has been rectified. But, please, do not judge this book by its cover. Everything I said in my original review still rings true: This is a special game, and captures the post-zombie-outbreak survival experience I’ve always wanted to play. Is it worth double-dipping if you already played the heck out of it on 360? If you haven’t played the expansion packs, I’d say yes -- particularly when existing State of Decay owners get $10 off YOSE’s $30 asking price. If you’ve already squeezed every last drop of fun out of this game on 360 or PC, though, the additions here are minimal.  State of Decay deservedly shattered Xbox Live Arcade sales records in 2013: it is a potent mix of RPG gameplay systems that all fuse together to create an unpredictable and tense survival experience. Time hasn’t taken anything away from that for Year One Survival Edition, and though it hasn’t fixed its technical problems either, this zombie-bashing, resource-managing post-apocalyptic gem still stands out from the horde of brainless zombie games."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/assassins-creed-chronicles-china-review	 Assassin's Creed Chronicles: China is a decent attempt at converting the Assassin's Creed experience into a side-scrolling form-factor, but it lacks heart. The pieces are all there, but they are patched together in a dry, passionless way that left me feeling emptier the longer I played it.  Chronicle's uninspired story is probably the best example of this. It's stitched loosely together with still drawing sequences that bookend each level. Apparently the main character, an assassin named Shao Jun is out for revenge against the Templars for...something. The voice actors playing the two main characters sounded positively bored throughout, making it hard for me to connect my actions with their motivations in any meaningful way. Fortunately the game itself is more well-constructed than its story, though it feels no less dispassionate. Chronicle's muted colors and sparse environments make levels feel hollow, but they're incredibly well laid out. Smart use of multiple background layers makes each area feel like a place rather than a flat plane these characters exist on. They also stretch out as far vertically as they do horizontally, providing multiple paths to your objectives. Exploring and seeing how the different paths connect to one another is probably the best part of Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China. Except, perhaps, for the occasional sections where you need to make a fast getaway, fluidly running, sliding and killing without missing a step. In these moments, Chronicles feels like an endless runner, and it’s almost better off for it; the actual stealth gameplay that makes up its core feels safe, even tepid by comparison. There’s a pleasing number of variables in play: differently-armed enemies that require specific attacks to defeat, the ability to hang off ledges, and the option to grapple your way up to certain ceilings. Particularly for a side-scroller, there’s a lot of tools at your disposal. Variety isn’t the problem, rather, it’s the simplicity of the answers. Chronicles gives you lots of different tools and obstacles, but the one you’re supposed to use at any given time is pretty obvious. There’s some room for improvisation, but it usually boils down to playing by the unwritten rules, and waiting a few seconds for guards to return to their regular patrol routes if you break from the script. Rarely did I feel rewarded for being clever. Even direct combat, which usually makes me feel powerful in other Assassin’s Creeds, feels oddly subdued. Battle animations are smooth, but devoid of style or energy. Interestingly, it’s more challenging than the combat found in the main series, with precision timing being required to even block incoming attacks. Coupled with the fact that you can only take a couple of hits before going down, and suddenly, taking on even two enemies at once becomes a test. This places a pleasing emphasis on staying out of trouble, with the option to fight your way out if you have the skill, but combat is conveyed in such a visually lackluster way, that it never felt thrilling. In fact, being a skilled assassin never felt so plain. There are many ways in which this Assassin’s Creed could have gone terribly wrong, but didn’t. Its problems lie, instead, in its inability to truly let the player off the leash, and its uncharacteristically soulless presentation. Assassin’s Creed Chronicles: China is by no means a poorly made game, it’s just an un-exciting one   Vincent Ingenito is IGN's foremost fighting game nerd. Follow him on Twitter and argue with everything he says about them.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/13/mortal-kombat-x-review	 Let’s just get this out of the way: Mortal Kombat X is the best Mortal Kombat, period. It’s deeper, mechanically richer, and more fully featured than any of the nine games before it, hands down. On top of that, developer NetherRealm Studios has taken a bunch of risks by adding eight entirely new characters to the MK roster, while introducing fun, distinct variations to returning ones. Each of these risks pays off to varying degrees, but they also serve to highlight some of the ways in which the franchise is stuck in the past. As a whole, Mortal Kombat X is an excellent fighter, and the most fun I’ve ever had with a Mortal Kombat game. The first thing MKX does to make itself feel new and exciting to both old series fans and casual fighters is a major roster shakeup. Before DLC ever enters the picture, MKX sports a respectable 24 fighters, and a whopping one third of those are honest-to-goodness new characters; not palette swaps or tweaked alternate versions of existing ones. Few fighting games with such a deep vault of fan-favorite characters have cleaned house so completely, and MKX is so much the better for it. Sure, I go way back with guys like Kabal and Smoke, but fresh faces like Takeda and Kung Jin bring so much novelty to the table gameplay-wise that it’s hard to be sad about their absence. Takeda is the most eye-catching new design, and he exemplifies what MKX does right with its new characters. He fights like you’d imagine a 21st-century ninja might, with an interesting mix of traditional weaponry and high-tech gadgetry. He’s got remote-controlled laser swords he can plant and recall at will, explosive kunai throwing knives, and arm-mounted, retractable grappling hooks that can open up into imposing blade-covered whips. He wields it all with a confident martial arts swagger that makes it all seem somehow plausible. In fact, everyone conveys their fighting style more effectively than in NetherRealms’ prior games thanks to the much-improved animations. Injustice was a step in the right direction of addressing the shortcomings of 2011’s Mortal Kombat, but MKX gets the rest of the way there: dash and hit animations no longer look like hapless flailing, for instance. Little details like this used to distract me from the fighting all the time, and I’m glad to see them finally ironed out. This helps MKX feel like the smoothest-playing Mortal Kombat ever. Walk speeds are snappier, pokes feel more useful, and with the awesome new variation system that gives each character three possible abilities to choose from at the beginning of a match, there’s more to explore, discover, and exploit than ever before. Liu Kang has a variation where he can switch on the fly between healing and damaging stances, new grappler Torr employs an assist character to double-team opponents, Kotal Khan can place totems to grant himself temporary buffs – this is the kind of stuff you usually see in games like Persona 4 or BlazBlue, and seeing NetherRealms open up so many fun new doors is really refreshing.  One mild distraction from the excellent combat is the visual inconsistency between characters. Some fighters, like Scorpion or newcomer D’vorah, look excellent, with tons of little details in their faces and costumes. Others, like Sonya and Jacqui, look far less detailed, with comparatively plain facial textures. It stands out because of the high peaks MKX hits during its best moments. With two of the better-looking fighters duking it out against one of the many beautiful backgrounds, this is one of the best-looking console games around, so it sticks out when everything isn’t up to the same high quality level. The inconsistency that sticks out the most for me, though, is the content of MKX’s so-so story mode, and how completely at odds it is with the dark and gruesome aesthetic Mortal Kombat has built over the years. Again, NetherRealms has created something substantial for folks who like a single-player experience, but it’s far less successful than previous attempts when it comes to providing a meaningful context for the bloody brawls. The spotty writing and voice acting are largely to blame, but the real issue is that it’s weaving a tale of family and young adults coming of age in a world about death and brutality. Without the storytelling wit to do something interesting and unpredictable, it’s simply a poor fit.  The chapters set in a civil war-torn Outworld fit the Mortal Kombat tone the best, but there is just no reconciling the feel-good tale of a single father who loves his daughter in story mode with the image of him gleefully tearing a hole in her chest and proudly standing over her fresh corpse in every other mode. Yes, of course, Mortal Kombat is ostensibly “about” Fatalities, and they’re gorier and more satisfying here than ever, but MKX’s story mode also wants to be about characters with deep ties to one another: fathers and sons, estranged lovers, budding romance, and long-standing blood-feuds finally laid to rest. Adding all of that drama to a series that began as a thrown-together story of a bunch of loners fighting to their deaths for their own reasons in strange, dangerous-feeling places leaves MKX feeling a bit confused in that regard.  There’s a small bit of this inner conflict in the excellent combat engine as well, but fortunately it matters far less. The bi-directional block button is back, and after being free of it in Injustice it simply feels limiting to come back. Scream “sacrilege!” all you’d like; the block button is a poor mechanic. It completely removes the left/right mixup that cross-ups are supposed to create in 2D fighters, eliminating an entire axis of mind games and setups without offering anything interesting in return. Still, there’s a ton to sink your teeth into here. Each character has a long list of attacks and combo chains that serve different purposes, from high/low mixups to safe block strings and juggle starters. X-Rays, the MK equivalent of super moves, have been retuned to be more worth the resources they cost to execute, and throws can be canceled out of and linked into full combos, giving you another meaningful way to spend meter. This makes resource management decisions that much richer. Most importantly, the ability to choose between three version of every character means there will be more matchup-specific stuff to learn, since playing against Sonya’s martial arts-focused Special Forces variant won’t prepare you for the oki setups she can create with her Demolitions style.  That’s what really matters in the end. Sure, the three or four-hour story mode experience feels middling and largely out of place, but story mode isn’t really what a fighting game is about. It’s endless nights in the lab and the joy of outsmarting your opponent in single combat. MKX provides all this with an incrementally improved version of the same great training mode from Injustice, and a solid suite of online features. The best of these is King of the Hill, which allows you to queue up and chat with a bunch of players while training, watching live matches, and paying respect for performances that impress you. It’s a fun, social way to play and learn with other people. The netcode is mostly up to the task of keeping online fights reasonably smooth, but there was usually just enough input lag to throw off my combos or punish timings relative to what I’m used to playing locally. Still, that’s a huge improvement over Mortal Kombat 9, and while online isn’t a replacement for in-person competition, it’s close enough to keep me learning and playing for a long time.  One more thing that will keep me coming back is the returning Krypt, where you unlock MKX’s humorously massive cadre of costumes, finishers, and supplemental materials. More than ever before, this interactive unlockable menu feels like a game of its own. There’s a certain thrill to spending your hard-earned “koins” to open up treasure chests that could have anything in them. That joy is somewhat dampened by the knowledge that you can just buy your way out of the entire thing with a separate $20 unlock key. It’s not the only thing that’s been monetized, sadly: new options for executing easy, two-button Fatalities or skipping story or tower fights require tokens, which are also sold on PSN and XBL. It’s worth noting I never felt outright pushed to get any of this stuff, but between all that and the big “push X to buy Goro” message that appears when you cursor over him on the character-select screen, it’s a bit too much in-game marketing for me to be okay with. It didn’t impact my enjoyment of the experience exactly, but even a hair more aggressive, and it would have. It’s sad that we’re even in that territory.  Story only matters so much in a fighting game. Combat is king, and there’s a ton of depth to mine from Mortal Kombat X. A much-needed transfusion of new blood, along with the ability to choose between three variations of every character means we’ll be learning, grinding, and discovering for a long time to come. Its universe keeps getting harder and harder to take seriously, and its microtransactions are borderline gross, but Mortal Kombat X is a great fighting game all the same.

Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/neverwinter-xbox-one-review	" Console MMORPGs are apparently tricky affairs: regardless of how much effort developers put into them, something always seems too off — too complicated — and up until now the genre's thus largely remained a PC thing, especially in its purest sword-and-sorcery form. But Neverwinter for Xbox One gets closer to the ideal than any other EverQuest-inspired console MMORPG before it. I’ve played and enjoyed Neverwinter before (when I reviewed it on PC two years ago) but this time its Dungeons & Dragons-themed online action hit almost all the right spots. As a free-to-play game, it blazes a trail for others to follow with generous content and great controls for its fast and fluid combat. I can’t ignore the deafening silence of its community and some potentially deadly performance problems, but Neverwinter stands among the finest free-to-play MMORPGs on consoles to date.  My own enthusiasm surprises me because I've already done this twice before, when I leveled two characters to the level cap of 60 on PC. Not much has changed about the core leveling process in the intervening two years, apart from the introduction of two new classes and new races, but interestingly, elements that I formerly found disappointing on the PC version have assume an odd sort of appeal on the Xbox One. Take the environments. Neverwinter isn't without its moments of beauty, and only a few hours in, I found myself looking forward to the moment when I could again ride up the haft of Lakkar's Axe, a skyscraper-sized greataxe that forms a bridge across a chasm on Mount Hotenow as though Marvel's Galactus had dropped it while trying to chop down Yggdrasil... or somesuch. The problem is that most of Neverwinter's heavily instanced zones are as linear as that haft, and many consist of little more than long paths as you bounce forward from quest to quest. Sometimes the path widens considerably, yes, but it's an experience that's not terribly unlike the opening 100 hours of Final Fantasy XIII, where the action unfolds across unrelenting, ill-disguised corridors before at last opening up to wider vistas. You eventually get that here at the level cap, but only in the form of slightly less linear instances. But on the Xbox One, I find that's not so much a problem. The focus here is on combat in the style of God of War or Darksiders, and Neverwinter usually keeps me so focused on it that I rarely find cause to miss more open surroundings. I like to smash things, and it obliges with simple controls that make use the seven classes’ diverse abilities. As a person who usually plays warriors in MMORPGs, I tend to judge them on how satisfying they make it to beat things down with a big hammer or blade, and regardless of Neverwinter's other issues, few MMOs beat it in this regard. I might hit the Y button to activate Restoring Strike, and boom, up goes my greatsword knocking back a dead enemy like Babe Ruth hitting a homer. I'll let my Daily powers build up, and bam, I shoot down to the Forgotten Realms with a slam that sends enemies reeling. Using these abilities with the Xbox One controller's rumble would make them even more exciting, which is why it's so bizarre to find it missing in action. I was surprised by that because developer Cryptic gets so much about the gamepad right. The number of active abilities is small (compared to what you'd find in, say, World of Warcraft or Lord of the Rings Online) but that means that they're easily mapped to the Xbox One gamepad, and to good effect. Pressing the left or right trigger activates the ""at-will"" powers, granting a hefty sense of swinging a mighty sword that I believe the keyboard often lacks. The rest of the active combat abilities fit comfortably on the X, Y, and B buttons, leaving room for interaction with objects on the A button. Non-combat stuff is neatly tucked away behind the Start menu and the bumper and D-pad buttons, allowing me to access my inventory almost as easily as I might with a keyboard hotkey. It's a model of intuitive design, and future console MMO developers would do well to study it.  What’s missing here is a reliably stable frame rate. Most low-level players will only see the framerates dip consistently in the combat-free streets of Neverwinter itself, where the crowds of players and NPCs sometimes overwhelm the hardware at moments when it can do the least harm. But in the higher and more detailed zones, like Icespire Peak, the environmental detail and weather effects sometimes slowed my Xbox One’s frame rate to a crawl. I can blame at least one death on Neverwinter’s frame rate causing a command to drink a health potion to go unheeded; when the world started moving again, my poor Great Weapon Fighter lay dead on the dungeon floor. To its credit, Neverwinter's combat is fun enough that I found myself looking forward to attempting the battle again, with a more careful eye on my health. The other major letdown is in a lack of communication. Without an equivalent of the useful communication prompts in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Neverwinter leaves everything to limited voice chat or text messages. The effect is that I leveled almost to the level cap without seeing a single player ever say anything in group, general, or looking for group chat. I once told a player I was ""headin' out"" using only my gamepad, but the ordeal took me what felt like half a minute. Connecting a USB keyboard or using the SmartGlass app on my phone was easier, but no one seems to be taking advantage of that.  That's a shame, as Neverwinter actually does have some good group content in the form of skirmishes, dungeons, and PvP arenas, but it's hard to make friends and socialize when communication is so unwieldy. (On the other hand, the silence also keeps the trolls who spoil the fun in World of Warcraft quiet.) Voice chat works fine, though, and I had my best time with Neverwinter when I grouped with a pre-existing Xbox Live friend with whom I could chat about life as we quested. Neverwinter does allow you to use voice chat in almost every group scenario accessible through the queues, but based on my extensive experience, almost no one keeps it on. I find myself wondering what this means for the future of Neverwinter's Xbox One community, particularly since this version lacks the player-made Foundry missions that emerged as the most memorable part of the PC version. Without that alternative to PvP and dungeons as a means of filling Neverwinter's inevitable XP gaps as you venture from one zone to the next, I did feel the grind a bit.  There is a built-in solution for that, in the form of purchasable experience booster packs from the cash shop. Neverwinter is, after all, a free-to-play MMORPG, but it sports one of the more generous models in that it lets you play through the entirety of the leveling content and beyond without spending a dime. Most everything available for sale is for convenience that I can generally deal without. The drawback, though, is that when you do want that convenience, Neverwinter saddles it with a literal high price. Almost everything in the shop is breathtakingly expensive – the smallest batch of coins costs $9.99. I was most interested in the Dragonborn Legend pack, which unlocks the Dragonborn race and includes a highly useful 30-slot bag among other things, but doing so would require that I fork out about $75. At that price, I'd be afraid of what people would say about me in-game. But then, nobody's talking anyway. Neverwinter's gamepad-friendly combat and intuitive interface make it the best fantasy MMORPG I’ve played on a console yet. Even with its frame rate issues and the persistent feeling of loneliness in a crowd, it's well suited for drop-in, drop-out gameplay, and its friendly free-to-play design makes it easy to come back to after a long absence."
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/rbi-baseball-15-review	 Every Major League Baseball team starts the season with the same record, but it doesn't take long to know whether a team will be a contender or a cellar-dweller. With RBI Baseball 15, I knew a championship wasn't in the cards after my second at-bat.  After David Murphy started my first exhibition as the New York Mets against the Boston Red Sox with a blistering single that almost reached The Green Monster, a sacrifice bunt by Michael Cuddyer led to a phantom out on first despite the fielder never tagging the runner or touching first. The rest of that game went without catastrophe, but that goof-up put an asterisk next to the result. Pretty much every subsequent has game mirrored that initial outing; while I'd go multiple innings at a time enjoying the decent (if shallow) arcade-style hardball, sooner or later a glitch or gross misrepresentation of the MLB experience would sour my attitude. To its credit, the on-field experience in RBI 15 has improved dramatically. (Though given how deficient last year’s RBI Baseball 14 is in terms of gameplay options, that’s a fairly low bar to clear.) If you prefer a static ball-height indicator that shows where a ball will land over RBI's default moving target that expands and contracts based on height, you now have an option. If you prefer mapping throws to each base to the corresponding face buttons on your controller instead of last year's inaccurate option of pressing a spot on the d-pad to correspond with the base while pressing the throw button, you can do that. There's a few more minor additions too, like the ability to choose between moving an individual baserunner or all players at once, and varying pitch speed by pressing up or down in conjunction with the throw, and the end result is a slightly more enjoyable day at the ballpark than last season. But wait, there are more glitches to rain out your fun! I've discovered some sort of Bermuda Triangle on the pitcher's mound where no AI opponent can pick up the ball (and I couldn't move onto the next batter unless I took advantage of the glitch and had all baserunners score). There's no manual button for diving to catch a ball, which can be frustrating when a ball runs millimeters from a fielder's grasp. Errors only occur when fielding, never throwing or catching throws, which makes it weird when outfielders consistently nail pin-point throws to home base from anywhere but the warning track. Starting pitchers still tire too easily, rarely making it into the sixth inning, even when I was extremely conservative with fastballs and rarely went deep into counts. Roster management is midway between the Mendoza Line and All-Star status. It’s improved over the miserable RBI Baseball 14’s missing stat tracking, but it’s still lacking. While I was able to get well into the first month of the New York Mets' 2015 campaign by keeping my players atop the league leader lists, managing my bullpen to keep relievers fresh, and tweaking my lineup to maximize production from the best of my bench, its shortcomings soon became obvious. Without the ability to trade players or having to worry about injury (or even fatigue for non-pitchers), I wasn't long before I grew tired of my simple 25-man squad. While there are hints in the UI that there will be roster updates (only the mobile version of RBI Baseball 14 had any last year), right now RBI Baseball 15 is still playing catch-up with games I played 20 years ago. If RBI Baseball keeps improving at this rate, it should catch up to Sony’s MLB: The Show series by 2045 or so. While there are a few improvements worth celebrating in RBI Baseball 15, and its arcade-style play has become slightly more attractive, the fact that I could barely get through a game without hitting an error that made me want to charge the virtual mound keeps it on the bench unless you’re extra-desperate for a baseball game on your Xbox One.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/31/forza-horizon-2-presents-fast-furious-review	 Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious is a short yet cleverly executed little crossover package that combines the beautifully balanced driving dynamics of the genre-leading Forza Horizon 2 with a smattering of some of the cars from Fast & Furious 7. It’s a fun way to spend an evening, although I noted it’s an experience largely built by repurposing wholesale slabs of Forza Horizon 2 content rather than doing much new or interesting with the movie license. Unlike last year’s Storm Island expansion, FH2 Presents Fast & Furious takes place on part of FH2’s main map but is an entirely standalone game (although this means a confusingly hefty download, even if you already have FH2 installed on your Xbox One). It’s basically a chunky, themed demo for FH2. It limits us to the French portion of the pre-existing map but it does cover quite a few event types in its brief two- to three-hour duration. There are tight street races around Nice, high-speed blasts through the countryside, a small clutch of stunt challenges, and a pair of the series’ trademark Top Gear-inspired Showcase Events (which, in this case, pit your car against a helicopter and a plane). As you’d expect, the racing and driving here is just as blissfully brilliant as it is in FH2. Several driving aids can be toggled to hone the experience to your liking, and there’s a huge amount of joy to be gleaned from tearing up France in the Fast & Furious series’ iconic black Charger, watching the butterfly valves on the blower work overtime as you poise nearly 4,000 pounds of Detroit metal in the perfect drift. The one notable new mechanic is a nitrous boost mechanic – an obvious inclusion for a Fast & Furious tie-in – and it’s been implemented well. When triggered, the screen shakes and there’s a nice, powerful shift in the already excellent audio. The overall effect on your speed doesn’t cross into Hollywood absurdity, it’s more subtle and realistic, but I think the latter is more fitting for Forza. It’s only available during events, however; you can’t activate nitrous in free-roam. It’s an odd design choice and one that’s slightly disappointing. But again, owners of Forza Horizon 2 will find little more than that by way of new content. The intro of FH2 Presents Fast & Furious, which drops you into a yellow Lamborghini Huracán, is largely a rehash of FH2’s introduction. The two Showcase Events are actually just repeats of existing Showcase Events in FH2 (the chopper race in the Xbox 360 version and the cargo plane face-off from the Xbox One version). The cars, weather, and time of day are different here, but the routes are identical, which feels a bit cheap.   With so much recycled, it’s somewhat strange that several regular Forza features have been plucked out. There’s no economy here; you simply earn the available cars by winning them over the course of a short series of 11 events (the action is narrated by Fast & Furious series actor Chris “Ludacris” Bridges, who provides the game’s credible but admittedly loose association with the films). There are also no visual customisation features either, nor is there any upgrading or tuning. Each car comes pre-tuned to the top of its class and you can’t apply custom designs. Perhaps most disappointing, the new cars built for FH2 Presents Fast & Furious aren’t able to make the trip back across to FH2 (or, least, they aren’t for now) if you own both. It’s a small shame because, once I’d clocked the available events and reaped most of the Forza Rewards points on offer via the Forza Hub (where it’s listed as a separate game), I’ve felt little reason to go back to this version. Forza Horizon 2 Presents Fast & Furious is a lean tie-in that at least provides some great-looking new cars, a boost of nitrous, and a short but appropriately themed set of races. It’s fun while it lasts, but it’s also proved to be disappointingly built around recycled maps and events. (It is, however, completely free until April 10, 2015, so by all means grab it while you can.) As an introduction to Forza Horizon 2’s more substantial driving action it’s quite a good one, but for long-time Forza fans it’s only really worth the quickfire 500 points to your Forza Rewards Tier (which determines your monthly gift credits in Forza Motorsport 5 and Forza Horizon 2 on Xbox One).
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/26/dragon-age-inquisition-jaws-of-hakkon-review	 Dragon Age: Inquisition’s Jaws of Hakkon expansion is a familiar mix of fetch quests, trail-following, and fade-closing; in other words, Inquisition’s bread and butter. While it doesn’t stand out enough from the main game to prove essential, it does offer beautiful Lost World-esque environments to explore, some tough new challenges, and a story that adds an interesting, if surprisingly low-key, dynamic to the Dragon Age universe. Jaws of Hakkon introduces a sun-dappled region studded with fairy-tale mushrooms, prehistoric nasties, and tropical birds known as Frostback Basin. Not only is this addition one of the Inquisition map’s most immediately beautiful terrains, it’s got a fair bit of design depth to it, too. As I galloped my way through it, I was treated to a wide variety of locales; a muddy, foggy swamp, twisted, dizzying tree trunks twisted into pathways, and little villages where I began the quests that would occupy me for a good five or six hours.   While I found the basic thrust of these overly familiar – “Find X to complete the quest!” “Kill Y to complete the quest!” “Oh no, Z is mysteriously missing!” – Jaws of Hakkon provides an interesting context to give each more relevance. It turns out that the Frostback Basin is being terrorized by fevered fanatics of the God of Hakkon, which causes trouble for your Inquisitor as you search for the final resting place of the last Inquisitor, missing in the region for 800 years. It’s a surprisingly impersonal story – your Inquisitor status is rather meaningless, and while your party returns with their signature vibrance, they merely provide background colour – but at the very least, it highlights developer BioWare’s skill at world-building. There’s a real sense of history here between the Hakkonites and Avaar who live in the region, and their traditions and rituals have been obviously created with a great deal of thought and imagination. Jaws of Hakkon also gives a bit more screentime to one of Inquistion’s most endearing characters: Scout Harding. While she remains characteristically professional, Harding – and her wonderful voice actress Ali Hillis – reveal a little more of her heart here, and Jaws of Hakkon is a more touching story for it. It helps that Inqusition’s sense of humour is dryer than ever in this DLC. While I wouldn’t dare recommend one party member over the rest (ahem – Dorian), Hakkon’s banter game is strong, and some of the characters you’ll meet have some fantastic one-liners that made me genuinely laugh – always a tough feat in the frequently ultra-serious fantasy RPG genre.   The lightness is particularly appreciated later on, when Jaws of Hakkon ramps up the difficulty to a teeth-clenching degree. For those even at a highish level – I began at 22 – there’s real challenge to be found here. The more I explored the region, the more Hakkonites swamped me in numbers, and the Pride Demons at fade rifts grew more relentless. For the most part I welcomed the sudden upturn in difficulty, particularly as I’d begun to take my power for granted after 60 or so hours of Inquisititing. The exception is that I would have liked the option to have changed my party composition at a certain brutal point in the late game, where a combination of inexplicable finality on BioWare’s part and poor-decision making on mine almost cost me six hours of progress. My advice? Manually save – and do it often. Jaws of Hakkon is certainly a worthwhile addition to Inquisition’s enormous map, although not an entirely consequential one. While there’s a real charm to the DLC thanks to its gorgeous environments and a light tone backed by intensely challenging combat, I hope the next installment offers an ever-so-slightly chunkier hunk of flesh to sink my teeth into.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	 Sitting down to tear into Borderlands: The Handsome Collection, I couldn't help but be impressed by the sheer volume of content it wraps up: two great action RPG-shooters, 12 well-differentiated playable characters, and hundreds of hours of story and side missions that take you from Pandora to the moon and back again. It's truly an embarrassment of riches.  Aside from the 1080p resolution and beefed up textures and lighting effects, nothing has changed here for Borderlands 2 or The Pre-Sequel. They're all just as generous with loot, they still feature some of the best humor in modern gaming, and they both still wield irreverent goofiness like a deadly weapon. For a more detailed sense of why we think these two games are so darn great, check out our full reviews for Borderlands 2, and Borderlands: The Pre-Sequel. Not only do they function wonderfully as shooters, but their gear and skill progression are still some of the best you can find amongst action RPGs, with zany skill trees that still make starting a new character fun even after a few hundred hours. The Pre-Sequel is particularly strong here, with every character having at least one skill tree that requires you to commit to strange playstyles in exchange for big-time power, like constantly reloading to become a whirling dervish of explosive destruction. The issues I have with this package are matters of minor inconvenience more than anything else. For one, once you've chosen which game to boot into, there's no way to switch to the other without closing the application and booting it back up, which is a somewhat inconvenient oversight. Second is slightly inconsistent performance. Borderlands 2 is rock solid whether playing solo or with three friends split screen, but while the Pre-Sequel mostly stays at 60  frames per second in single-player aside from the occasional hitch, in four-player split screen, the frame rate is half that, and sometimes worse. What's more, the skill and inventory screens aren't scaled proportionately with your screen quadrant, so you can only see a slice of these screens at a time. None of this stuff is a deal-breaker, but it does make couch co-op just a bit less enjoyable. Minor quibbles aside, The Handsome Collection is a great package for any console-bound Borderlands fan. The fact that it collects every piece of DLC for both games, the majority of which is of very high quality, plus the fact that you can carry your last-gen saves and characters over, makes it a good pickup for returning fans and a great pickup for new ones.   Vincent Ingenito is IGN's foremost fighting game nerd. Follow him on Twitter and argue with everything he says about them.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-4-review-2	 Considering the sheer amount of plot threads dangling at the end of episode 3, there was a great deal of pressure on Resident Evil Revelations 2: Episode 4 - Metamorphosis to end its story in a satisfying manner. Although it takes a good stab at doing so, it loses much of its charm along the way, and some extra-creaky gameplay adds up to make the finale the the least satisfying episode of the entire series. The story this time around is told with po-faced sincerity, to its detriment. All humour is gone, replaced by unintentionally silly theatrics (“I am a god!” “Come out from behind the glass so I can choke a god!”). It reminded me of the clunkier dialogue in the original Resident Evil; funny, considering all the knowing winks and nudges toward that game in earlier episodes.  Worse, in an attempt to explain the complexities of the plot at the last minute, developer Capcom has taken to heavy-handed exposition via notes and additional reading material. Not only do we find an open diary revealing our villainous mastermind’s innermost thoughts, there’s a manifesto lying about in her lair titled ‘Hatred of (character X)’ followed by reasons why she hates (character X). Resident Evil has never been subtle - which is arguably part of its charm - but this is clumsy. Fortunately, there’s a breathless pace to Moira and Claire’s chapter that leaves little room to linger on the issue. It’s a single escape sequence that requires you to battle invisible enemies and work cooperatively against the clock, and while it’s not the most challenging of chapters, it begins and ends with a couple of big story moments that add to a sense of high stakes. The same can’t be said for Barry and Natalia’s chapter, which drags. While the section on a crane is a standout, most of the experience was totally forgettable, involving lots of walking back and forth, moving carts, and fighting the same clutch of enemies I killed last episode – including the same crummy boss. It doesn’t help that chunks of their chapter take place in poisonous gas, so I was doing much of this while listening to the pair cough in a non-stop loop. It’s a pace that carries on into the final boss battle. While Capcom’s artists have clearly had a ball here – the final form of the Overseer is the most delightfully gross monster in Revelations 2 – it’s a lengthy slog of a fight, and one with a surprising lack of any real challenge in Survival Mode. Still, the endings (a ‘good’ one and a ‘bad’ one) do clear up some of Revelations 2’s mysteries, even if it’s a case of piling more on as a lead-in to a sequel. The two bonus episodes, ‘Little Miss’ and ‘The Struggle’ fill in further gaps, and more, they’re nice little compact stories in themselves.   If you’re still playing the excellent Raid mode, Resident Evil Revelations 2’s shooting-gallery minigame, every gauntlet and character (including Alex) is now available to unlock. I continue to be impressed with the breadth – and addictiveness – of Raid mode, which extends Revelations 2’a shelf-life well after the credits roll. Episode 4: Metamorphosis does a satisfactory job at tying up Resident Evil Revelations 2’s mysteries, yet it also presents us with the clunkiest gameplay and dialogue we’ve seen in this series. While the bonus episodes and robust Raid mode extend the life of Revelations 2 beyond the credits, I wish it had gone out with a slightly bigger bang.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	 In Battlefield Hardline’s single-player campaign, I had as many chances to arrest the bad guys as shoot them – and I actually wanted to take them alive. That was only the first of many surprises.   Unlike most video game bad guys, these enemies actually respect the badge of a police officer, and that gives you options. If you can get the jump on a group of three or fewer, you can order them to freeze by pulling out your badge and shouting. From there, you can arrest them... or gun them down. If you can stay out of sight, cuffing them is usually the superior option because it earns you more points, which unlocks more weapons and gadgets. If you’re really good, these levels are designed intelligently enough to allow you to sneak around arresting bad guys one by one until, finally, when you look around, all you see are handcuffed, knocked-out criminals. It’s not the kind of satisfaction I expected from a Battlefield game, but it requires patience and skill, and I was constantly delighted to see my enemies’ numbers dwindle while my magazines stayed full. Again, you can also run around shooting everyone, and that works too. Part of Battlefield’s legacy includes realistic weapons that feel and sound great, and that’s no different here. When I forgot to disable an alarm and 10 enemies surrounded me, my rifle was a lot more effective than handcuffs.  Second, Hardline’s seven-hour campaign is – and I never thought I’d say this – just as fun to play in stealth as it is running in guns blazing. Before entering combat, you can scan an area and tag enemies, explosives, or alarm systems so they’ll appear on your radar. It’s rewarding to formulate a grand plan from afar before jumping into the action. With proper preparation, enemies’ cones of vision appear directly on your minimap, Metal Gear Solid-style. If you can avoid detection, it’s entirely possible to make it through most areas without firing a single lethal round. My biggest gameplay gripe is that the unlock system doesn’t appropriately award your playstyle. The best way to boost your level, which dictates the weapons and gadgets at your disposal, is to play stealthily. Strangely, mastering stealth mostly unlocks tons of big, noisy guns that made me want to shoot the place up. Likewise, if you want to shoot stuff all the time, you’re not going to get your hands on new guns as quickly as the stealth player who doesn’t need them. And there are very few unlocks that make stealth more interesting. The third surprise was that I cared about the characters. My disapproving partner, my stern boss, and the motley crew of ex-cops, coked-up criminals, and more than a few traitors – all of them felt like people, thanks to good writing supported by strong voice and animation work. Make no mistake, Hardline’s drug-peddling plot is one you’ve almost certainly seen before, but it does such a fine job of making its characters funny, sympathetic, and believable that I wanted to keep playing to see what would happen to them. Hardline has a few issues with some of its enemies though – specifically, a group of one-dimensional Tea Party caricatures in possession of a safe-cracking robot. They’re presented as over-the-top evil racists to give you an unambiguous sense of morality when gunning them down. They told my character “You look Mexican, so I’ll assume you’re a burglar.” An hour later I was facing off against their leader, who hooted and hollered as we engaged in tank-to-tank combat. It’s fun, but hard to take as seriously as the subject matter suggests it should be. By comparison, the story’s main villain is devious and cunning. He’s not the most interesting or memorable bad guy, but he’s the kind of narcissist who keeps the secret switch to his penthouse vault inside a carved bust of himself. I can appreciate that kind of vanity, and going after him was less of a black-and-white decision thanks to a few shades of gray. The last surprise Hardline’s campaign had for me was moments of comedy. Several laugh-out-loud moments make some self-aware fun out of its own crazy situations and mechanics. In one especially clever moment, after being flung into a room packed with enemies, the prompt to order enemies to put their hands up briefly flashes on the screen. In another moment, nearly $10 million worth of cocaine is ruined in an unfortunate forklift accident. It’s not forced, and those nods to Battlefield fans makes the campaign that much more enjoyable. Battlefield has a history of looking and sounding excellent, and Hardline continues the tradition (though resolution is a disappointing 720p on Xbox One and 900p on PlayStation 4). Through gunfights, car crashes, and explosions, it all runs at a smooth 60 frames per second that stayed rock solid on PS4 and Xbox One.   The tone of Hardline’s multiplayer is downright bizarre. If a smack-talking gamer kid grew up to be a cop or a criminal, this game would represent them. Through in-game emotes, the characters trash talk each other, recite internet memes, and blare loud, obnoxious music as they ride to war. I didn’t expect to hear my allies give their own takes on Oprah’s famous “You get a car” line, nor did I expect to hear “Woop! Woop! That’s the sound of da police,” moments before a cruiser ran me over. At least in the short term, the emergent comedy is unexpected gold – and sometimes you won’t see it until it literally flattens you.  New gadgets, like the grappling hook and zip line, add further options by letting you reach higher vantage points and move around quickly in a way we haven’t seen in a Battlefield game in 10 years. Plus, your team can use them too, so they can use their gadget slots on something else. The issue is that these mobility items don’t feel useful unless you grab both – a way to get up, and a way to get down – which limits your capabilities for what you can do when you’re up there. I often had to sacrifice body armor, breaching chargers, or some other useful gadget. The most astonishing thing about Hardline’s multiplayer is how successful it is in trying to please everyone. If you want more capital-B Battlefield, like the iconic Conquest mode and its large-scale vehicular combat, 66 players, and tons of weapons and gadgets to unlock, you’ll find it here. Even Commander mode is back, now dubbed as “Hacker mode,” and it lets you hijack cameras, release tear gas, and disrupt enemies across the map. It’s a great way to be proactive without firing a weapon, if that’s not your thing. If you’re feeling franchise fatigue, its new modes and gadgets alleviate that. Hotwire is Hardline’s fresh marquee mode, and it injects some much-needed mayhem into Battlefield’s 13-year-old multiplayer formula. Think of it as a special version of the traditional capture-and-hold Conquest mode, but, instead of holding structures, you have to keep control of moving vehicles; if you don’t drive them fast enough, you don’t get points. (It’s the sort of like the concept of the movie Speed, but gamified.) When the most contested combat areas are mobile, the flow of the fight itself becomes dynamic, and it’s difficult to skirt around the fight. A sniper might feel safe, for example, crouched on a crane near the edge of the map. Second later two vehicles might roar by, packed with thugs firing their assault rifles. Those cars might then attract the attention of a heavily armed helicopter, belching out bullets from both its sides.  Suddenly, your safety zone isn’t so cozy. War can descend on you at any moment. You’re rarely comfortable, and you’re never safe. That makes Hotwire a great mode that forces you to move around and adapt to new situations quickly. I had some trouble adjusting because of my old habits of patrolling one area (it’s not camping!), but I had a good time learning to adapt to the new reality. After a few hours of getting my butt handed to me, I was back in business. Some of Hardline’s other modes take everything Battlefield is known for and do the opposite: 5v5, round-based games that can be over in seconds. In one mode, the police must rescue a bound hostage and escort him to safety. In another, a VIP must be escorted from one side of the map to the other. In both modes, you only have one life. The action is quick and brutal, and the big, unfolding combat narrative found in typical Battlefield games is absent. It’s not missed, though, because, that “story” is replaced with awesome kills, tense standoffs, and plenty of amazing comebacks.  The payload of nine maps isn’t a ton, but because they’re so varied and change depending on the game mode, so I never felt like I was stuck in the same place for too long. Settings range from small, tight, urban areas to sprawling swamps, where an enemy could be prone behind any patch of grass or below any crippled dock.   Across both current-gen versions of Hardline, all of the multiplayer matches I played on launch day connected in literally two to six seconds. This includes both quick match games and games I connected to through the server browser. The connection stayed consistent too, and I was able to see them through until I won or lost. Battlefield Hardline impressively manages to please several different audiences at once. Its campaign is both a great shooter and a great stealth game, and its typical plot is spiced with interesting characters and sparse but punctual humor. The large-scale tactical multiplayer combat the series is known for is still as good as it’s ever been, but the speedy new Hotwire and round-based 5v5 modes provide both speed and thrills.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/final-fantasy-type-0-hd-review	" Final Fantasy: Type-0 had me in tears after watching a chocobo bleed to death in the opening scene, and for the next 40 hours I would experience everything from sadness to disbelief as the thin but reverent story unfolded. During that same time, the zippy action-based combat made running around the world of Orience a lively experience, though viewed through an occasionally obstinate camera. Type-0 has a strange dichotomy of action and emotion, but it comes together to create a roleplaying game that works on multiple levels.  Everything in Type-0 is tied to war, which makes for some intriguing presentation of the usual Final Fantasy features. Magic comes in the form of fire bombs, lightning missiles, and ice bullets, while the story progresses via military campaigns that involve liberating towns, defending bases, and invading cities. Even chocobos are bred for war; I liked that by capturing birds in the wild and correctly breeding them, you can hatch combat-ready chocobos that help fight in sorties, or can race across the world map to quickly arrive at a destination. The tale of an elite group of young cadets fighting an aggressive military empire serves as a reminder that it’s the young who die in war, and who are the first to be forgotten. Class Zero’s emotional struggles – like watching friends die on the battlefield and then feeling guilty because they’re unable to remember them, is incredibly moving. Unfortunately, the cringe-worthy voice acting in the English-language version sometimes distracted from the solemnity, especially when the class loudmouth Nine kept adding “yo” and “hey” after every bloody sentence. Luckily, there are humorous moments sprinkled in to lighten the mood and keep the story from getting too dark; I laughed out loud when a saucy cadet named Carla sweet-talked a military instructor, then turned around to brag about her manipulation skills. Campaigns that involve running through city streets or infiltrating fortresses were pretty fun, but I had a hard time with the real-time strategy missions that popped up here and there. I nearly rage quit one operation because the stubborn camera and clunky controls made it hard for me to move around the battlefield. These annoying mechanical issues were inherited from the original PSP version of Type-0 (which was released exclusively in Japan back in 2011), along with a few other noticeable limitations: NPCs have blocky faces, wall textures are blurred and jaggy, and dungeons and towns are little more than long, monochromatic corridors. I was so bored by most environments that I stopped caring about them halfway through the story. That said, the “HD” graphics in Type-0 definitely have some wonderful lighting and shading effects. This is especially apparent in the central hub area of Akademia, where marble floors gleam with a fine polish, and beams of sunlight stream brightly through large glass windows.  CGI cutscenes are especially well done, with detailed animations of Eidolons soaring through the sky, and brutal close-ups of soldiers being slaughtered on the ground. Developer Hexa Drive did a great job bringing these powerful scenes to full-sized TV screens. Final Fantasy Type-0’s best feature, though, is the rapid, action-based combat that allows you to mix and match party members to create versatile three-man squads on the battlefield. Each member of Class Zero has their own distinct weapons, abilities, combat styles, and speeds, which makes them feel like real individuals: Jack is slow-moving but can easily slice through monsters with his sword, Seven can nimbly dodge enemy soldiers while using her chain whip to deal out vicious attacks, and Rem can use her Undying Wish spell to temporarily prevent cadets from falling on the battlefield. And if one of your team members does fall, you can immediately summon another cadet from Class Zero’s reserves to replace them, or call on a powerful Eidolon to help thin out enemy ranks. (Eidolons tend to be unwieldy, though, and require the sacrifice of one of your party members in order to summon them.) You can even request NPC support units from Akademia to help you on campaigns, which is a nice way to earn special points that can be used to acquire rare items. Whether I was fighting mundane soldiers or taking on more exciting enemies like poison-spitting serpents and giant, angry snow beasts, I felt powerful because the combat was always super fast paced. In fact, many victories were achieved in less than a minute using the handy ""kill sight"" and ""break sight"" features, which allow cadets to heavily damage or even instantly kill an enemy with a well-timed attack. Levelling up so many cadets in order to make sure they were all combat ready required a lot of patience, but I didn’t mind since Type-0 includes a nice array of ways to beef up your characters. You can accept side quests from NPCs, train at Akademia’s battle arena, increase magic skills by attending a lecture, participate in random battles on the world map, or re-do story campaigns accessed from the main menu.  It may seem like it’s easy to overpower Class Zero, but almost everything you do is tied to the limited amount of free time you have between military campaigns. This clever bit of time management forced me to think carefully about which activities I participated in: did I want to spend two hours talking to an NPC, or leave Akademia and lose six hours so I could go on a monster hunt? Time was of the essence, and I enjoyed having to use it wisely. Finally, I had a little bit of an issue with the convoluted ending, which requires a second playthrough and a lot of reading up on Orience’s lore to fully comprehend. I didn’t mind relying on the in-game compendium for some things, but having to bend over backwards to understand what’s going on didn’t add anything to the story. Type-0’s gritty tone, fast-paced action, and strategic approach to time management is a welcome change of pace from the usual Final Fantasy experience. Though an exasperating camera and clunky mission controls sometimes dampened my fun, I enjoyed meeting the Class Zero cadets and guiding them through battle. There’s definitely no other class quite like them.   Meghan Sullivan is IGN's database master and a huge JRPG fan. Follow her on Twitter."
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/11/the-evil-within-the-assignment-review	 It’s remarkable how much of a departure The Evil Within’s first story DLC, The Assignment, is from the main game. Where the original is all about bullets and confrontation - albeit with a blundering lug of a character - The Assignment is more about staying in the shadows, avoiding enemies, and keeping a cool head in the face of terrifying monsters. It’s the sleek black cat to The Evil Within’s big shaggy dog, and a great addition to Game Director Shinji Mikami and Tango Gameworks’ new survival horror universe. The Assignment’s three-and-a-half-hour story runs concurrently with the main game’s, filling us in on what Juli Kidman – a detective, or perhaps an agent for a sinister agency? – was up to during her mysterious absences. Throughout, you’ll see original protagonist Sebastian and his partner Joseph in familiar situations, which adds to a sense of a much bigger and wonderfully ominous picture.  This story is still as high-concept as it ever was, but it helps that Kidman is a more knowledgeable character than Sebastian from the get-go, and more likable, too. Voiced with confidence by Dexter’s Jennifer Carpenter, she’s a more reactive, and therefore believably realistic, character. Carpenter even sells Kidman’s somewhat cliched backstory, told through audio tapes, with a performance that avoids theatrics. Physically, Kidman is less powerful than Sebastian. Roughly 95% of the time she is unarmed, and there is no upgrade system in The Assignment. Instead, her skillset focuses on stealth. Kidman can lure enemies by calling out while taking cover against walls or other objects, throw bottles to distract them, move without running out of puff, and auto-heal rather than use syringes. These abilities work well – for the most part. The Evil Within’s old-school controls don’t always lend themselves to fluid movements, and occasionally I got stuck to a surface or unintentionally popped out of crouch when trying to turn a corner. The ‘stealth attack’, introduced later into the episode, also feels a bit haphazardly implemented – that became an issue for me when a boss fight relied on it. But considering how thrilling it was to play a survival horror game with nothing at my disposal but a torch, I didn’t mind much. I spent a lot of the time running blindly with my heart thumping, hoping a distracted enemy wasn’t now in pursuit, or yelling in triumph after locking one in a room. Without a weapon, the tension builds quickly. Adrenaline is encouraged by The Assignment's sinister environments. Tango has once again done some wonderful things with lighting, with many of its twisted corporate interiors drenched in sickly, flickering fluorescence, and others in dirty, wet shadow. I frequently found myself crouched behind flimsy cover in the dark, terrified to turn on my torch, as footsteps ever so slowly made their way towards me.  Although their A.I. isn’t as sophisticated as, say, Alien: Isolation’s, enemies in The Assignment will pursue and kill you quickly, so you’ll want to avoid confrontation at all cost. While I would have liked a little more variation in enemy design, and perhaps more threatening enemies overall (l died considerably less here than in the main game) there is a particularly vicious recurring enemy in The Assignment that I loved. To describe it at all would spoil, but it’s up there with The Evil Within’s keepers and Resident Evil 4’s regenerators; in other words, a Mikami Special. The Assignment offers up a thrilling three-and-a-half hours in The Evil Within’s grimy universe. Its stealthy gameplay, beautifully designed environments, and refreshingly grounded protagonist make it stand out from the main game, and a cliffhanger ending suggests there’s much more good stuff to come in part two: The Consequence.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/10/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-3-review	 “I don’t know why that makes sense – but somehow it does”, says Moira Burton in Resident Evil Revelations 2: Episode 3: Judgement, as she completes a puzzle which - in typical Resident Evil fashion - is devious, but defies any kind of real-world logic. It’s a nice summary of this episode, as Judgement continues the twists and turns at a healthy clip. The original Revelations spent a great deal of time over-explaining the semantics of its complicated relationships; Revelations 2 is thus far content to let us sit back and enjoy the mystery, as Moira and Claire get closer to the truth, and Barry and Natalia get closer to Moira. (Whether or not it can tie up these plot threads together in a satisfying way, however, remains to be seen.) Admirably, there’s a real attempt to flesh out the characters here, too. While Barry Burton’s voice actor is better suited to gruff quips than spilling his guts, he has a nice little moment with Natalia that gives him a little humanity and grows him beyond his  “master of unlocking” legacy. Claire also gets to show an emotional side, and although both stutter through awkwardly written dialogue, I found their earnestness endearing.  But it's the clever riddles and traps in Judgement's (unfortunately still bland) environments I enjoyed the most here, which made me wonder why they were absent in previous episodes. Keeping with Resident Evil tradition, many of these are outright silly (like the one that causes Moira to get a little meta), but some incorporate genuinely clever level design. During one section, for instance, Barry and Natalia must move a box from one end of a level to the next. Throughout this task, you must use both characters’ abilities to keep enemies at bay, while placing and standing on the box to reach high spots and open gates. It’s a wonderful segment, and I wish more of Revelations 2’s unexciting corridor environments could have been spiced up in a similar fashion. Such inconsistency in design seems to be the common theme in Revelations 2 on the whole. Of the two boss battles in Judgement, one is a tense and thrilling affair in which Claire must face an extremely agile creature who can latch onto her like a lizard-tongue from long distances, while the other is dull and cripplingly unimaginative: Barry fights a creature with a glowing red belly that shambles at you slowly until you’ve plugged enough bullets into him. To me, it felt like the designers ran out of ideas, put this cheap guy in as a placeholder, and never took him out. Still, Judgement gallops along at a great pace, and ends once again on a very curious cliffhanger. I’m properly invested in Revelations 2’s pulpy, dime-novel story, which is a great thing to be able to say at the pointy end of the series; here’s hoping the final episode delivers on its many promises.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/dmc-devil-may-cry-definitive-edition-review	 When we reviewed DmC Devil May Cry on PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC, we called it a great game. Here’s what we said then: “Long-time Devil May Cry fans unsure of Ninja Theory's treatment can abandon their fears. DmC hurls Dante into a newer, better world, complete with a glorious combat system and enough style to make old Dante proud. This is digital action at its finest, steeped in the blood of angels, spiced with gunpowder, and garnished with a middle finger.”  You can say all the same things about DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. In fact, it’s added some fresh features to the already polished eight to 10-hour campaign to make it even better. Obviously, the most noticeable difference for this version of DmC over the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 editions is its looks and performance. The colorful, vibrant world of Limbo looks great in 1080p resolution, and runs smoothly at 60 frames per second. That makes a big difference for an action game. It also adds eye-catching layers of lighting and shadow effects, and all of this brings it more in line with the excellent PC version. A small selection of character and weapon skins lets you dress Dante up in his signature red-and-black outfits from previous Devil May Cry games for a little extra variety. The only hitch is that on both PS4 and Xbox One, I saw cutscenes drift out of sync with their audio. It’s just a little surprising, considering everything else looks so good. Its beauty is more than skin deep, too. DmC already had one of the most elegant combat-control schemes of any action game to date, but this Definitive Edition adds a lock-on system. That makes it easier to track enemies and execute signature lunge moves like the Stinger, or to focus on the biggest threat in a group of enemies.  Don’t like the sound of “easier?” Don’t worry, because the sublime combat system, which already offered lots of fun options with which to kick demon tail, can be sped up about 20 percent, which makes fights more intense. On top of that, brutally challenging new difficulty modes like hardcore or Gods Must Die will give any expert demon slayer a deadly run for their money. Toss in the rebalanced enemies with different attack patterns and tells, a new 60-floor arena called Bloody Palace made exclusively for Virgil, and you’ve got plenty of reasons to keep fighting the demonic hordes of DmC again and again. DmC Devil May Cry: Definitive Edition brings the same great game to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, along with a couple of tweaks to make it feel different for returning veterans. The sharper visuals, smooth 60-fps gameplay, and other features and enhancements gave me plenty of reasons to be happy about coming back, and to recommend that you pick it up for the first time.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	 Darkness, and the fear of what might be lurking in the shadows, can be terrifying. Or, it can also be deeply annoying – as exemplified by White Night, the adventure-game equivalent of banging your shins on a coffee table. The relationship between light and shade is brought wonderfully to life using a distinctive monochromatic graphical style, which lays the ground for an atmospheric and eerie adventure. Yet the same style undermines its exploration and puzzle-solving elements every step of the way.   The tone established by a near-exclusive use of black and white is definitely the best aspect of the experience. With a slow jazz piano playing softly in the background and darkness enveloping the lead character, I felt like I was stepping foot in a classic noir thriller from the ‘30s. I was drawn in by its heavy use of tropes, deliberately overwritten dialogue, crammed with outlandish similes, and its grizzled voice over – White Night wears its pulp influences proudly. But it’s also a haunted house mystery and a Hitchcock-inspired thriller. In short, there are a lot of influences swirling around, and while some overlap quite nicely – the damsel in distress reimagined as a restless spirit – overall I found it a bit of a muddled mashup. Where it definitely succeeds, however, is in creating atmosphere and a sense of place. Vesper Mansion is a gloomy, fascinating environment I initially loved exploring. Emptying the world of colour creates a stark and stylish take on reality, where darkness really can consume you and light really does feel like a precious and powerful resource.  Matches are needed to help you navigate the shadows, but they burn out quickly and provide no real protection from the evil ghosts that freely roam the gloomy corridors; electric light is the only way to permanently exorcise any nearby spirits. It reminded me of the original Resident Evil, where every room of Spencer Mansion had something cool or creepy to disclose, with the most disturbing secrets being buried deepest. Likewise, the spooks themselves are excellent; they’re fuzzy, flickering creatures that look tormented in death. You can just about glimpse them through the darkness, contorted in a variety of sinister poses, from facing a wall or swinging from the rafters. If a ghost spots you, it issues a piercing cry and chases you – and that, right there, is the moment when White Night stops being any fun at all. It is possible to evade them, but more often than not, being spotted means you’re heading back to the last checkpoint, which is usually a frustrating distance back. There’s literally nothing you can do, unless you happen to be next to an electric light at the time. Any tension I felt pretty soon gave way to frustration, then boredom. Who wouldn't want to go inside? You can only save when you find an armchair in which to have a bit sit-down (similar to the original Resident Evil’s typewriter save system) which would be fine if Vesper Mansion weren’t so sparsely furnished with them. I found myself returning constantly to the nearest armchair – even if nearest meant a bit of a trek – to save my progress every time I completed a stage in a puzzle I was in the process of solving, because it got to the point where I couldn’t face redoing it all again should I accidentally run into the ghost on the final step. That sounds whiney, I know, like I’m not up for a challenge. But the frustration I felt was exacerbated by another factor, one that unfortunately I have to traced back to White Night’s greatest strength: that art style. At the core, this is a puzzle game, in which you have to find items and solve problems. For example, you move an object and a ray of light falls to reveal a key. It’s neat, smart, and works well… but none of this is particularly aided by the near-absence of light or the insta-death enemies, and it’s actively hindered by the use of fixed camera angles. Seriously, for one reason or another, you can’t see what you’re doing most of the time. Mother! At the beginning, I thought these stylish shots were fantastic. There’s one shot early on which looks down on you from a bird’s-eye perspective as you walk up the steps of the mansion; it’s straight out of Hitchcock’s Psycho. But when I was trying to find a light switch, and the camera angle obscured its location until I stepped into a very small sweet spot, I could have quite happily done without the artsy presentation. Sometimes I even resorted to the boring-but-reliable tactic of sweeping the perimeter of a room to see if an interaction icon would appear. (If you’re ever stuck, it usually means a light needs to be switch on somewhere.) Welcome back to the tedious old days of pixel-hunting adventure. The art style and premise are great: as a detective, you’re meant to introduce light into White Night’s world of darkness. And early on, it definitely feels like this is going to be a neat, smart idea that’ll be central to everything. But once you get into the house, it mainly involves scrambling about in the dark and bumping into furniture you can’t see as you run away from ghosts you can’t see either. The bones of a decent procedural horror game are buried under roughly six feet of frustrating fixed camera angles, insta-death, and bad checkpointing. Ultimately, it’s just not that much fun being a detective in the dark.
Jake Magee	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	 Dragon Ball XenoVerse takes most of what I like about the anime and role-playing games and combines them into a single, great-looking package. It’s strange, then, that it mostly neglects the single most important thing that makes Dragon Ball Z great: the fighting. I had fun building a hero all my own, but her journey through the DBZ lore is deflated by one-sided fights and combat that boils down to what feels like glorified button-mashing. I was ultimately left wanting more than the shallow, frustrating, and repetitive combat.  As much as I wanted to love the combat, I couldn’t. Every different combination of face buttons and resulting varying animations led to the same outcome: punching your opponent and making them fly far away from you. The strategy behind these fights never gets very deep, and I settled into a repetitive but effective pattern of punching and kicking a villain across the map, then charging up to get enough Ki to use an ultimate attack. (Annoyingly, those miss half the time—even when an enemy stands directly in front of you as your worthless beams pass through their body). Defense is in the same boat: when an enemy starts to get a combo going, dodging isn’t worth the stamina cost and blocking requires almost psychic-like reflexes to pull off, meaning I never really used them. Instead, I helplessly took the assaults, then returned the favor until someone’s health invariably ran out. With combat a lackluster affair, the most enticing part of XenoVerse is the ability to create your own fighter. From Saiyans to Namekians, there’s a wide range of races to choose from, each with unique stats and fighting styles. Everything from their gender, size, shape, and voice is customizable. I settled on Muu, a mute female Majin known for her high defensive capabilities, fast speed, and slow stamina recovery. The story she starred in is straightforward but at least somewhat original; I’m happy it was more than a shameless rehash of the anime (though it felt like one at first). It was awkward to hear characters like Trunks and Goku refer to Muu as the gender-neutral “they” or, bafflingly, even as “he” during the in-game scenes, and the cheesy dialogue and terrible voice acting certainly didn’t help matters – but I’ll take that over playing as the series’ overused protagonists any day. With character creation comes leveling up and stat allotment – an odd choice for a fighting game all about aliens with world-destroying energy beam powers and masculinity complexes to feature such heavy role-playing influence, but it’s cool to see a character I invested time in grow and ultimately become more powerful. The pacing of character progression in XenoVerse is great, as new powers and skills are unlocked gradually – and there are a lot of them. Crafting a skill set of hard-to-acquire special moves that worked with my fighter was half the fun.  Despite enjoying the RPG elements of tailoring Muu’s stats, equipment, and moves, taking a health potion after having the tar beaten out of me just doesn’t feel right for the Dragon Ball Z universe. XenoVerse would have been far better off eliminating items altogether and just making combat a more balanced experience, because many fights are completely unfair. One early story mission put me up against 20 enemies, demanding that I keep two NPCs alive the whole time. This wouldn’t have been so bad if my allies weren’t completely worthless, but as it is, it became a race to see if I could destroy all 20 opponents on my own before they took out the teammates I was forced to babysit. Another mission late in the game spiked in difficulty so severely that I was forced to grind – a boring and arduous process – for several hours before I leveled my character enough that I even had a chance to proceed. In fact, after a while most missions became a frustrating tease. Just after expending most of my health potions to down a difficult enemy, a cutscene would play and the fight would resume with the majority of my opponent’s health restored. I’d lose, have to back out to the hub world, trek to the item shop to buy more potions, and repeat the process.  Fortunately, distractions from the 30-hour single-player campaign aren’t hard to come by in XenoVerse. I found more joy teaming up with other players to take on unique missions called Parallel Quests that rewarded me with money, experience, and new moves and powers. Those rewards often make them more valuable than story missions. Stages feel cramped and static, but Parallel Quests often feature multiple levels to give them some variety. Unfortunately, the competitive multiplayer battles are the shallowest of XenoVerse’s modes. Quick and dirty, they’re over in minutes, meaning I spent more time getting the tedious matchmaking to find a game than I did actually playing. On the surface, Dragon Ball XenoVerse seems like a great game for someone like me who enjoys anime, fighting, and role-playing games. Customizing my own character’s equipment and move pool is fantastic...but it’s hard to get excited when combat feels hollow, especially for a franchise all about heroes stronger than Superman. The unique story features a nice change of pace from the anime’s sagas, but unfair missions left me annoyed. Considering how boring the competitive multiplayer is, I found cooperative Parallel Quests to be the best way to take the action online.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/03/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-2-review	 With its furious pace, tough boss battles and punishing lack of supplies, Resident Evil Revelations 2: Episode 2 makes the first episode feel leisurely in comparison. While still defiantly an action game, surviving in Revelations 2 is now a much tougher prospect. In other words; now we’re in business. In Episode 2: Contemplation, Claire Redfield and Moira Burton continue to be taunted by a cryptic puppet-master in an intriguing story that’s getting more Saw-like by the minute. This baddie isn’t scary, per se - like a number of Resident Evil villainous overlords, she's all pantomime - but I’m enjoying the mystery of her, and the way in which she’s particularly adept at ushering her unwitting minions toward dastardly cliffhangers. Breaking Revelations 2 into episodes is a bit of a strange choice, but there’s something to be said for a bit of rest and contemplation between these breathless encounters.  As our villain becomes more wicked, so do the enemies that populate Revelations 2. One of my complaints in the first episode was the mundanity of its monsters, and while they haven’t grown more interesting, they’ve certainly grown more resilient (and in greater numbers). Coupled with a genuine scarcity of supplies, there are are a handful of of boss fights - and a ridiculously tense chase sequence - in Episode 2 that I had to do over multiple times. One in particular essentially required me to get a headshot with every pull of the trigger, while dodging charge attacks and fireballs; as you might imagine, the exhilaration of toppling the guy was immense. Considering both character pairs – Claire and Moira and Barry and Natalie – are unevenly balanced in terms of physical strength, such encounters require strategy, particularly when playing split-screen co-op. As the toughness ramps up, Moira’s weaknesses are put into stark relief; without a weapon, there’s little she can do but run. This can become frustrating, but on the other hand, it can be a thrill to play as “the bait” for your partner’s trap, if you’ve got the cojones for it. That you’re required to be so considered in co-op is a strength of Episode 2. More teamwork is required in this episode in general, and it’s better for it. Natalia’s formerly useless ‘pointing’ ability is suddenly given meaning in the presence of invisible enemies that only she can see, and her ability to see monsters through walls lends itself to a stealthy approach. The Last of Us vibe I felt in the first episode is even more prominent here, and the occasional opportunity to not go in shooting is refreshing.  On the other hand, I continue to find Revelations 2’s environments bland. While crumbling villages and deserted medical centers might be a traditional staple of the Resident Evil series, they’re boring, and the lack of environmental detail seems odd in 2015. Boxy design made sense in the Revelations console port in 2012, given its 3DS origins, but here it’s less excusable. Fortunately, Raid Mode continues to offer more variation, with its colourful urban arenas and the odd level plucked from Revelations’ Queen Zenobia. Episode 2 unlocks two new characters to play, Pedro and Gabe, whose Drill Charge and Ground Pound specials are wonderfully efficient at clearing out big groups of enemies quickly. Resident Evil Revelations 2: Episode 2 bolts through its four-hour campaign at a breathless pace, thanks to some hard-as-nails boss battles and tense stealth sections. Despite uninspiring environmental design, stakes are getting higher, enemies are tougher, and co-operative play is more essential. Now that’s more like it.
Miranda Sanchez	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/02/screamride-review	 Using the thumbstick to tilt the wrong way as my roller coaster approached a tight turn, I launched a car containing four shrieking test riders into the base of a nearby building. It only grazed the corner, and for a moment I was disappointed. Seconds later a car went up in flames, causing hidden explosives to detonate and demolish not one, but three buildings, which crumbled spectacularly. In Screamride, I flung, flipped, and exploded ride testers in the name of science, built roller coasters of doom, and defied gravity while speeding through twisting coaster tracks – and I had a ton of fun doing it. Screamride doesn't have a prominent story in its career mode, beyond some background radio chatter that explain tidbits about its world. This is a testing facility, so you'll jump straight into the action of riding, destroying, and building roller coasters with none of the park management of something like Rollercoaster Tycoon.  Each job – ScreamRider, Demolition Expert, and Engineer – has a distinct tone and atmosphere, and each can be played as much or as little as you please. If, for instance, I want to get my adrenaline pumping and test my reaction skills, I'd boot up a ScreamRider level. Combining time trials and obstacles, such as tracks where one rail drops out so you have to control your speed and tilt your car to keep your passengers from falling to their doom, this mode is a challenging and fun action roller coaster simulation. Often times gravity won, but that was no problem as my cart was equipped with explosives or a rocket booster, so when I inevitably knocked the cart off the rails, I’d do my best to launch my riders into one of the surrounding buildings for some fun destruction – I might not get a high score, but I’ll take that consolation prize. While getting back on the track or restarting the entire level was just a button press away, I noticed this transition has some frame rate issues in the larger levels, or when there was a massive amount of destruction. It wasn’t terrible, but it did pull me out of my adrenaline rush. Those performance woes are odd, because Demolition Expert mode doesn’t share them, and it’s much more about breaking things for entertainment. Using small coaster cars and two-person cabins, I flung ride testers into explosives, magnets, and other objects to help me do the most damage possible. The quality of the physics of each building tumbling down or exploding is impressive – instead of disappearing into the nether, a structure’s rubble piles up beautifully and can even pose as another obstacle. Explosions are especially satisfying to watch, as they usually cause a massive chain reaction. It was fun to just chuck the cars at buildings randomly, but Demolition Expert was even better when I finally figured out the cadence of each level.  Trampolines scattered in the water taunted me to hit them in a perfect order. Then I’d see flashing red explosives in a building not too far off that I could hit with the long-distance car. There’s an unexpected amount of strategy required to get the biggest explosions – and thus the highest scores – and it was incredibly satisfying when I finally set off a chain reaction. Screamride allows for some flexibility, though, so you could fling cars without planning and still be able to pass the level. With Engineer mode, I was given all the right tools to create my own awesome rides and death traps alike. Engineer is very similar to the Sandbox mode, but here there are restrictions in place that challenge your ability to manage resources. Some levels require you to connect several track pieces together while maintaining a high speed. Others would fail you lose any riders – yeah, if your G-Force is too intense, riders will fly out of their cart. I like how it doesn’t make you guess where you mess up, giving helpful hints by marking your trouble spots and where you hit achievements like high speeds. Constructing roller coasters in Engineer mode is a nice break from the chaos of the other two jobs; the music is relaxing, and the controls are simple yet complex enough to build intricate coasters. There are quite a few special loops, twists, reverse turns, jumps, and other special pieces that award extra points when used. For example, there’s an ejection piece that launches a few riders out of their seats which is useful if you’re trying to damage buildings or hit explosives.  Regrettably, this mode has some wonky camera angles. In one level I ended up staring at a pillar surrounded by water while I heard buildings crumbling. Whether I wanted to prevent future disasters or observe the results of my intentional one, that’s annoying. My frustrations didn’t stop there. Out of the six areas in Screamride, the last two had an annoying difficulty spike that didn’t really flow with the rest, which had progressed wonderfully with steady and enjoyable challenges. Even so, I found myself replaying the challenging levels as the leaderboards inspired me to beat my previous score. All the tools and lessons learned throughout the career mode culminate in Sandbox mode. Some of the cool amusement rides and building blueprints are locked until you reach a certain level in career mode, but there’s enough to play with if you’re only interested in creating levels. There are tons of building pieces in all sorts of materials and colors, so you’re not limited to just building roller coasters – you can design an entire island, its buildings, and attractions piece by piece, or you can use blueprints to speed up the process. Sandbox mode’s tools surpass Engineer’s, such as with the very handy copy-and-paste tool that makes creation fast and simple. While this mode mostly gives you free reign, there is a limit to how many total pieces you can use and the maps have size restrictions, but I never found these to be severe limitations.  It’s easy to jump between creating and testing, so I could constantly check whether or not my ride functioned, or exploded, properly. If I liked a specific ride or building, I could select the structure or a section of it and save it as a blueprint. What’s cooler is that I could then share that blueprint or the entire level by uploading it to the Level Center. Playing and downloading other players’ levels is just as simple. Screamride’s three jobs allow you to play and pass its thrillride levels in a variety of ways, but I reached the greatest satisfaction when I discovered the perfect way to traverse a track, build a coaster, or demolish a string of buildings in ScreamRider and Demolition Expert modes. Although career mode suffers from uneven difficulty and some situational camera issues, I happily replayed levels to improve my score sheet and climb the leaderboard, or just endlessly tinker with the Sandbox mode.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/24/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-the-bright-lord-review	" When I play an expansion like Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor’s The Bright Lord, I have to wonder if developers sometimes misunderstand what made their game so successful in the first place. In this DLC, Monolith goes out of its way to make up for the lackluster final boss fight in the main game by adding a challenging face-off with Sauron himself, but takes steps backwards when it comes to the reason I really loved Mordor: its dynamic uruk enemies that created countless mini-boss battles throughout the campaign.  A flashback story puts us in the still-corporeal shoes of Celebrimbor, as Sauron abducts his family. We know how this ends, and there are no twists – just Celebrimbor and Sauron smack-talking like pro wrestlers for four or five hours as you take over the Undun section of Shadow of Mordor's map (again). The good news is that Celebrimbor’s combat style shakes things up. Compared to Talion, he’s much more about branding enemies stealthily or in bulk and building up an army, using his Shadow Brand ability to brainwash any enemy you can see, or his improved Wraith Flash to brand multiple enemies at once. You can even summon a posse of pre-mind-controlled uruks to your side at almost any time. Those are wildly powerful moves (and hordes of glowing-eyed uruks can take a toll on frame rates), but they're kept in check by the fact that Celebrimbor can't take as much punishment as Talion, so every so often you have to massacre them all to restore your life and start the cycle over. Archery takes more skill, too, because you don’t get the slow-motion effect when you draw your bow anymore, so it's way harder to headshot your way through a crowd of incoming uruks. But Celebrimbor is wearing The One Ring, which he can charge up by branding enemies and activate for slow-mo and infinite, unblockable execution moves for around 30 seconds. (And that's before doing any side missions to upgrade the duration.) The effect of this power on Mordor's memorable Captain and Warchief fights is completely ruinous. Even though uruks can now reach level 25, any fight can be won by simply activating the ring and mashing the execute buttons until it’s all over - their resistances are completely nullified. It’s the same ridiculous ""win-button"" mistake Warner made with Batman: Arkham Origin’s Shock Gauntlets, and here you start out with it from the beginning. Power like this defeats the purpose of combat and makes wins feel unearned, and I found myself avoiding using it except when I absolutely needed to. Also, The Bright Lord actually makes its Warchiefs and Captains feel less dynamic. You can’t kill Warchiefs, only dominate them, because they’re actors in the story. Meanwhile, there are no captains jockeying for position or advancing independently of your actions in the background, so there are no dynamic duels, feasts, or executions to interrupt. It makes the world feel static and scripted, which is a shame, because the behavior of those enemies is what I like best about the main game. That final boss battle, though, is pretty good. It’s built around managing a large crowd of enemies to build up your powers before taking on the big threat, which is a heck of a lot more interesting than a quick-time event. I just wish the rest of The Bright Lord were built around enhancing Mordor’s strengths rather than patching up its weaknesses. When I recommend Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor, it's because of its outstanding dynamic battles with randomized uruk Captains and Warchiefs. The Bright Lord undermines that greatness with a new power that renders those fights irrelevant, and focuses its energies on  a big boss battle.   Dan Stapleton is IGN's Reviews Editor.

Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/24/resident-evil-revelations-2-episode-1-review	 No longer restricted by the limitations of a handheld original, the first episode in the sequel to 2012’s Resident Evil: Revelations delivers a tight and fluid action experience on current-gen consoles, with plenty of excellent options for co-operative play. While it curiously under-delivers on imagination where locations and enemies are concerned, Episode 1: Penal Colony marks the start of a confident action-horror story which contains enough pulp to leave me eager for the next three episodes.   Episode 1 dances between two pairs of familiar and not-so-familiar Resident Evil faces: Barry Burton’s teenage daughter Moira and Claire Redfield, and in a distinctively Last of Us-esque combo, Barry himself and Natalia, a little girl with strange powers. The mysteries in Episode 1 are big and juicy, and not over-explained; a relief considering Resident Evil’s tendency towards convoluted exposition. Further, it’s all a lot less po-faced than I have come to expect from this series, thanks to accomplished voice acting, amusing interplay between Claire and Moira, and some healthy self-deprecation (at one point, Claire mutters “I was almost a Claire sandwich”, followed by some severe eye-rolling). In a series so often bogged down in big science and ultra-seriousness, I enjoyed the dark humour. I was also relieved to find that significant improvements have been made to character mobility since the last Revelations. The dodge move, haphazardly implemented in the original,  is now easy to execute, and the quick turn similarly more intuitive. There’s a lot less stopping and starting in Revelations 2, and a lot more running and dodging; in other words, it’s kept up with modern action games. Co-op is now available in Revelations 2 from the get-go, and it works well. After the last game’s disappointingly useless puppet AI, remembered mostly for pumping ineffective rounds into enemies to give the illusion of teamwork, it’s great to see that this time ‘round he or she has a particular skill that is essential on the battlefield. Moira’s flashlight can be used to blind enemies and find hidden objects, while Natalia can crawl through tiny spaces, throw bricks, and use her “sight” to see enemies before Barry can. You can - and will likely want to - switch between characters on the fly. Although I would have liked more co-op puzzle solving, split-screen combat dynamics are particularly fun; as one character in each pair is significantly under-powered against enemies, you must learn to communicate with your partner in order to stay alive.  With the moment-to-moment gameplay so well orchestrated, I was surprised at how uninspiring Episode 1’s environments are. The prison where most of the action takes place is dull, its rooms and corridors dark and grainy and painfully samey, without an eccentric puzzle or elaborate trap to be seen. Such boring design feels like a real backstep, considering the grand, ornate interiors of the Queen Zenobia in the original Revelations (and indeed, the gorgeous interiors of the original Resident Evil). All told, the first episode’s campaign took me roughly three and half hours, though I imagine this would have been a significantly smaller number had I not spent so much time going round in circles. Enemy designs, too, lack imagination here. In 2015, brainless shamblers are merely heads to be popped, and in this episode at least, you’ll pop them easily. Considering how the Resident Evil series has evolved over the years, it’s barely worth pointing out that Revelations 2 sits more comfortably in the gung-ho action genre than in the one labelled ‘survival horror’, and I do recommend you play through the campaign on the harder difficulty if you’re looking for real challenge.  Fortunately, the Raid minigame is once again a highlight, played either solo or in split-screen co-op. These furious shooting-galleries - where the ultimate goal is to kill all the enemies in an arena below your level without healing yourself  - do offer real challenge; at least if you want to complete each at 100% in order to unlock the best bonuses you can. There’s a great deal of depth to Raid’s customization, via skill trees and collectable weapons, while beginner stats differ from character to character, making for interesting combos in co-op. For score chasers, this mode promises a great deal of longevity outside of the main campaign. Revelations 2: Episode 1 is let down by dull environments and creature design, but a terrific co-op mode, intriguing story, and replayable Raid Mode balances out its flaws. Not quite a headshot, then; but it’s left a bloody impression on me nonetheless.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/23/dead-or-alive-5-last-round-review	 Dead or Alive 5, in all its incarnations, is the best numbered entry in the long-running fighting game series in terms of raw mechanics, and Dead or Alive 5: Last Round doesn’t change that fact. It’s still the fast, fluid, accessible brawler it was when I reviewed its original incarnation over two years ago, and the PS4 and Xbox One versions look ever-so-slightly sharper than it did back then. But despite positioning itself as the definitive version of DOA 5, Last Round feels slightly weighed down by some problematic glitches, and uninteresting new characters that make it feel unnecessarily fan-service-focused.  First thing’s first: the fighting in Last Round remains as excellent as ever. You can read my full review of Dead or Alive 5 for details on what makes the fighting system so addictive, but in short, DOA takes the rock-paper-scissors idea that lies beneath the hood of most fighting games and bakes it right into your every move and decision. The triangular relationship it creates between throws, holds, and strikes make every moment an opportunity to outthink your opponent. Even before you start wrapping your head around a character’s extensive, varied move list, DOA empowers you to recognize your opponent’s tendencies, and punish them for them. This is the very essence of what makes fighting games great, and like its predecessor, Last Round does it incredibly well. Something else that’s set DOA apart over the years, is how distinctive, flashy, and fluid the characters’ many fighting styles are. Many of them jump off from a traditional martial arts base, and then start taking entertaining left turns with teleportation, elemental attacks, and spinning piledrivers that would make Street Fighter’s Zangief cry (very manly) tears of jealousy. DOA 5’s original cast still walks that line between authenticity and audacity with grace and energy, but the same can’t necessarily be said of the characters that have joined the cast since then. Dead or Alive 5 Ultimate introduced some new characters as DLC, and Last Round includes them all, plus two additional challengers, for a total of 34. This gives Last Round the largest playable cast in DOA history, but with rare exception, most of these newcomers and returning series favorites feel bland and forgettable, thanks to a lot of reskinned models and generic move sets. Honoka is probably the worst offender here: she’s just a generic-looking schoolgirl with a patchwork move list cobbled together from totally disparate styles across the the rest of the cast. Sure, having more options is great, but if they aren’t interesting ones, more ends up feeling like less. The more frustrating thing about these characters is that their inclusion feels, on one level or another, more like fan-service rather than good design. Ein and Leon are throwback fan-favorites from older games, but they’ve since been effectively replaced by Hayate and Bayman, respectively. Phase 4 is literally a Kasumi clone - the second Kasumi clone (after Alpha 152). Honoka and Marie Rose have completely forgettable fighting styles, but hey, who doesn’t love a couple of underage-looking girls to throw into a scandalous outfit or two, right? This is the old DOA mentality, the one I was happy to see banished in the original Dead or Alive 5. Seeing it creep back in is as frustrating as it is disappointing.  Not all the characters added since DOA 5 are a bust, though. Momiji and Nyotengu both sport fighting styles interesting enough to make me want to learn them. Nyotengu, like some of the less successful new characters, is a riff on an old DOA character, but one whose highly unorthodox move set has never been reused or repurposed. Momiji's style, while certainly reminiscent of the many ninjas of the cast, adds enough flaming flourishes and impressive acrobatics to set her apart. Watching the two of them face off falls somewhere between late-night Hong Kong wire-fu and a live-action Avatar fan-fic, in the best possible way. Feature-wise, Last Round is as impressive as its predecessor, which featured an excellent training mode and robust online features, like the ability to run online tournaments, kumite, or training sessions. Sadly, as of this writing, not all theses features are working as intended. Depending on which platform you’re playing on, you might encounter any number of game-crashing, save-data-corrupting bugs. One particularly troubling issue is the lack of support for MadCatz fight sticks on the Xbox One version, which Team Ninja is looking to fix, along with the many other known issues. It’s worth noting that while playing with online throwdowns turned off, I didn’t run into these issues on PS4, but seeing as Team Ninja is acknowledging them on its Twitter feed, it’s safe to say I’ve been lucky.  When you’re in the midst of a tense, down-to-the-last-read match in the middle of a battlefield erupting with explosions, Dead or Alive 5: Last Round is great. When that fight is compromised by out-of-place barely legal schoolgirls in bikinis or a game-crashing bug, it’s decidedly less than great, and the experience you’ll get will depend whether your online opponents choose to play as one of the more interesting characters. It’s an unfortunate asterisk to put next to an otherwise excellent fighting game; one which suffers from losing focus on quality in the interest of adding quantity and fan-service.

Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	" Bandits are such punks. There I am, minding my own business as I mosey down a typical dark, wooded pathway, when suddenly boulders start falling down toward my head like Louisiana rain. Luckily I survive. But barely has the dust cleared before I hear one of the morons asking his buddies if I'm still alive, and after all I've been through – after goblin ambushes, plague-spitting rats, and grumpy merchants – it's just too much to handle. I jump up toward them, prepared to teach them a lesson with the business end of my axe, and you know what? I do. Acting out this scenario, which sprung from a the hand dealt to me in a virtual collectable card game, in real-time action gave me more enjoyment than I would ordinarily have gotten out of this kind of simple attack-and-counter combat.  It's a competent collectible card game on one level, yes, but it's also an action-RPG with little sprinkles of choose-your-own-adventure stylings thrown in for good measure. The key triumph of Hand of Fate is that, despite some complications with the action, it manages to juggle such motley components without dropping and shattering them and the fun. It certainly doesn't hurt that this world oozes with personality, created by presenting a game within a game. My in-game character spends all of my sessions seated across a game table from a guy who looks like Richard the Warlock from the LFG webcomic, watching as he throws down cards with attractive art that draws obvious inspiration from Renaissance woodcuts. He's there for the duration, and it's a good thing that he's likable despite a faint air of menace. Always quick to deliver a dour quip in a sonorous voice (""For eons I have waited for an more appropriate player; it seems there are more eons ahead,"" as he says during a lull), he plays less like a Magic: The Gathering deckmaster and more like a tarot reader, revealing my fortune in familiar spreads like the Celtic Cross. In a sense, he is: his face-down placement of the cards resembles the rough outlines of a dungeon map, and progression hinges on moving a golden gamepiece from card to card, turn by turn. It sounds a tad complex on paper, but it's easy to learn the rules and quirks just by playing. It's crafted so well that, early on, it does more to recapture the open-ended nature of old pen-and-paper Dungeons & Dragons sessions than games that bury you under arcane stats and scripted scenarios. At the same time, it usually works so well in part because it's not completely random. My customized deck determines the possibilities of each level, and it's stuffed with cards for both weapons and encounters that I've won from tokens awarded after victories in the roughly 10-hour story mode. Early on I preferred the Helpful Priest card, which grants blessings if you give the poor sap half your food (the resource needed to make the jump from card to card). At other times I might uncover the Winding Trail, which might toss me into real-time battle for the chance to win access to one of the weapons I'd woven into my deck. It's a setup that would quickly grow boring and predictable if left alone, but Hand of Fate wisely complicates things by letting the dealer tossing in curses that sap life or food, or, in his better moods, friendly priests that can undo the damage. If there's a problem, it's that he's a tad too generous for the first few hours, as food replenishes quickly enough to make failure a near-impossibility. True, the Rock Fall described above originated from his cards, and it could have ended in death had I not drawn a ""Success"" card from the four cards he slapped down in response. And then there's the combat, which occurs when I reveal a card for, say, Goblins, and the dealer draws a numbered card specifying how many goblins I fight. The system smartly relies on risks for rewards. You start off with shabby gear with each ""level,"" but opportunities to pick up better stuff continually present themselves depending on how you've structured your deck. Throw a ""Embertown Hero"" encounter card in your deck, for instance, and your travels might lead you to a dying knight who offers to give you that godly frost sword you stuffed in your deck if you agree to kill some random enemies for him. It's a shame the combat encounters never enjoy the same sense of freshness of the card game that surrounds it. They're certainly attractive enough, and they feature a hero who looks like someone imported Ragnar from the History Channel's Viking series into the world of Fable II. (Tough luck if Ragnar's not your type, as customization's a disappointing no-no here.) Considering how brief they are, they're surprisingly visually diverse. Some maps feature our cartoony Ragnar dodging flame throwers and spikes in a maze; others have him bruising heads in a tavern or on the outskirts of a primeval forest. Again, though, it's the combat itself that sags a tad. Consider it Batman: Arkham Asylum (or these days, Shadow of Mordor) lite. Our hero uses the X button on an Xbox controller to slash at the enemy, the Y button to counter after the prompt appears (if you were smart enough to stash a shield card in your deck somewhere), and the A button to dash out of harm's way. And that's about it. Sometimes I activated special abilities with the left and right bumpers, but battles usually end so quickly that it's rarely necessary save in the boss battles that cap each level. Battles never deviate from this structure, and their difficulty usually varies only in terms of how many enemies are on the field (although this gets quite difficult late in the game). If the dealer draws a Four of Skulls, you can rest assured you'll be fighting four skeletons, who take at most 30 seconds to kill. And so it goes on forever, particularly in the tremendously replayable ""Endless"" mode, which pushes you to outlast the dealer for as long as you can. In such extended playthroughs, it's perhaps inevitable that the dull pangs of repetition set in, likely because Hand of Fates component features are relatively simple despite their depth when mashed together. On the bright side, I found that stepping away from the game for a few hours was enough to rekindle my interest. Usually I found myself more bothered by technical issues, such as the way the dealer's shuffling animation bogs the Xbox One down to a crawl or how the music and the dealer's voice often cut out on the PC version. Of the two I sampled, the Xbox One version seems far more stable. Hand of Fate takes familiar elements from collectible card games, action RPGs, and choose-your-own adventure games and jumbles them all together to create an experience that generally feels unique and fun. Isolated technical glitches, an overly generous dealer, and simple combat dampen some of the fun, but the novelty of the design is usually strong enough to pull up the slack.

Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	 Where a lot of high-concept games start with big promises and end in scaled back disappointment, Evolve achieves exactly what it set out to do. Through an array of intelligent design choices, developer Turtle Rock Studios has created a smart, asymmetric, multiplayer monster-hunting game that plays unlike anything else. It’s tactically deep, bursting with character, and once you get past its mildly obtrusive progression system, it offers a level of nuance rarely found in multiplayer shooters.  A core concept as novel as assuming control of a hulking behemoth and facing off against four player-controlled humanoids could easily have fallen into gimmick territory, if not for the thoughtful way that Hunt, Evolve’s core mode, is structured. Having the monster start out relatively weak, only to feed and grow in power as the match progresses generates a lot of tension for both sides. The monster needs to move quickly and carefully, balancing the need to put distance between itself and the hunters with the need to find food to level up. It’s a high-stakes tightrope act that requires good map knowledge, and a strong grasp of the monster’s surprising number of non-combat abilities like climbing, sneaking, and sniffing around. For as effectively as they exude an intimidating physical presence, playing the monster successfully requires patience and skill. Overpowering the hunters is really just your reward for outsmarting them, which makes ripping them to shreds as a max-level monster feel just as satisfying as it looks and sounds. As the hunters, the continually interesting challenge is to find a cunning monster that doesn’t want to be found amidst the sprawling and beautifully realized planet of Shear. Fresh tracks and startled birds are among the more obvious clues, but following them like a bread crumb trail is rarely enough. You need to reason out where the monster is headed, and make effective use of your team’s amusing sci-fi gadgets. You might tag tempting wildlife with a tracking dart, so that when the monster eats it you can get a bead on its location, or pursue a monster with an unmanned drone to relay his position to your teammates. Since every second that passes without the monster in your crosshairs is another step closer to it becoming nigh-unstoppable, hunts are every bit as thrilling as they are nuanced.  Though it’s hard to take it all in when you’re embroiled in an intense monster fight, Evolve looks and sounds remarkably good.  The ground rumbles deeply with Goliath’s every step, and Kraken’s Lightning Strikes light up the screen, sending Hunters tumbling in every which direction while startled wildlife scatter in fear. Each individual element is well executed, but combined as whole during a match’s most pitched moments, the complete picture really is a sight to behold. The true beauty of Evolve, though, is in the subtle details that flesh out its world, its characters, and its mechanics. Characters preen and pose on the title screen, emoting with a cartoonish flare that makes each one memorable. From playful pre-match banter to defiant mid-match monster-taunting, the plentiful voice overs are well written and delivered. Maggie in particular stands out with her fiery intensity and rich cultural history, which gets unpacked in pieces the more I played her – and after more than 20 hours played, I’m still catching bits I never heard before.  The real genius behind Evolve’s gameplay is the way each character’s abilities synergize, and how each has importance beyond its basic functionality. For instance, Val’s tranq gun is primarily used to slow the monster’s movement, but since it reveals the monster’s position through walls, it allows Cabot to make better use of his structure-penetrating rail cannon. It can be tough to land a hit on a moving target with Hank’s Orbital Strike, but once Abe tosses out a Stasis Grenade or two to lock the monster down, you can nail it with no problem. This leads to some rich decision-making at the character select screen, where team composition becomes incredibly important. Evolve is full of tactical possibility, and fortunately, the AI-controlled bots are good enough to test a lot of this stuff out when playing single-player. Annoyingly, some of that possibility sits locked behind a progression system that, while not unreasonable, feels unnecessary. With all 12 hunters, three monsters, and all their perks unlocked, Evolve feels complete and fully fleshed out, but getting there can take anywhere from a few hours to a couple of weeks depending on how good you are and how frequently you play. This makes Evolve seem more limited than it actually is at first, which is a shame because once it’s all opened up, it’s anything but.  With the default Hunt mode being so central to Evolve’s identity, it’d be easy to forget about the Nest, Rescue, and Defend match types, but I’m glad I didn’t. Their more straightforward, objective-focused styles make for a nice change up, and they all provide new opportunities to apply your characters’ skills and gadgets in different ways. Bucket’s Sentry Turrets and Markov’s Arc Mines take on a whole new importance in a mode like defend, and Lazarus’ ability to bring colonists you’re trying to rescue back to life effectively gives the team more time to get to them. Considering that Evolve’s unique mechanics feel specifically crafted for Hunt, the fact that they work in equally interesting ways in the other modes was a pleasant surprise. It’s rare for a big multiplayer game like Evolve to feel so considered and intelligent. Everything – skills, mechanics,  and design choices – seem to interlock in a way that’s both natural and purposeful. That it’s so mechanically rich and still conveys the raw energy and fun of duking it out with huge monsters and action-figure-esque hunters is a real design feat. Its progression system stifles it a bit early on, but regardless, Evolve is a deeply rewarding multiplayer experience that packs both brains and brawn.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	 As I creep though the familiar-yet-eerie corridors of Resident Evil, I can't help but feel terrified of Crimson Heads. Even 12 years after I first encountered them, it's genuinely frightening every time they spring back to life to try to tear a hole in my esophagus, but they're also a great example of why Resident Evil still holds up. While inconsistent art and persistent clipping problems give away that this is an update of a 1996 survival-horror game, the scares, puzzles, and atmosphere of the creepy corridors of Spencer Mansion are as potent as ever.  Ever since the tweaks made in the 2002 GameCube remake, Resident Evil has been a tense game of resource management. The makeover to the many rooms, puzzles, and monsters give it an edge that significantly surpasses the original game. Every zombie you spend precious ammunition to kill becomes a ticking time bomb that’ll turn into something much more deadly if you don’t dispose of them properly with fire or headshots. That persistent danger is what makes the frequent backtracking through this labyrinth of locked doors something more interesting than typical busywork. As Resident Evil uses adventure game-style design to send you looking for keys and objects that have to be examined closely to solve puzzles, then brought back to the right location, you can feel the stakes rising as the chances of getting mauled or caught without the right resources increase. Resident Evil is a gauntlet of twisted monsters and hard decisions. Make the wrong choice or take too long on some objectives, and sometimes you’ll pay for it with the death of a comrade or missing out on precious resources. It’s punishing at times, and managing the different inventories of two playable characters forces you to be smart and frugal with regard to what you carry with you. The constant pressure makes it a difficult game to play by design, but one that still manages to be fair. This HD remastered edition of Resident Evil looks pretty good on the new-gen consoles, thanks to 1080p resolution and some nicely touched up backgrounds and textures, with the PC version offering the highest settings and a nifty option to switch between 60 and 30 frames per second. The biggest improvement across all versions is the ability to scale the experience the way you want to play it. You could choose between 4:3 or 16:9 aspect ratios, and you can swap the original “tank-style” controls for a more modern setup that moves your character in the direction you push the stick. As an old fan I prefer the original controls, but the new controls help make Resident Evil accessible without sacrificing the tense nature of combat. You still have to stand your ground in order to shoot zombies and deal with the pressure of enemies getting closer. Since most face-offs happen in tight spaces, it’s not super easy to pull a juke move on multiple zombies, even with the new controls. Purists can have it the way the designers originally intended. Newbies can jump in and not completely break the game. Dimly lit rooms with ambient effects like lightning or floating dust particles are some of the best to look at in this update. However, some backdrops look garish under a lot of light, and there are some noticeably blurry textures and pixelated art. I’m also disappointed that the major clipping problems still haven’t been fixed. Maybe in the next remake, Capcom? I love coming back to Resident Evil, and this version does a good job of updating the look and feel of an old game for a modern audience. Some of the older visual flaws detract from the experience and pulled me out of tense moments, but the gameplay hooked me right back in. Resident Evil relies on atmosphere, tough limitations, and danger creeping around all corners, and this port recaptures the formula of a classic, relentless survival-horror game.
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/saints-row-4-re-elected-review	 When IGN reviewed Saints Row IV in 2013 on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC, we awarded it a score of 7.3, for “good.” Here’s what we said then: With its recycled map and wildly overpowered abilities, playing Saints Row IV feels a lot like enabling god-like cheat codes in Saints Row The Third and going nuts. Its ridiculous story, goofy characters, self-aware humor, and amazing character editor make it all work, especially for those of us who’ve played the previous games and can appreciate its in-jokes. But its appeal is shortened by the ludicrous speed at which we can zip across it and grow tired of its lack of challenge.   It's just as much fun in Saints Row IV: Re-Elected for Xbox One and PlayStation 4, which repackages the old-gen original with all of its DLC and a strangely paced but creative new standalone adventure, Gat Out of Hell. Visually, Re-Elected offers a small but noticeable improvement over the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions of Saints Row IV. Obviously it’s higher resolution, the lighting's a bit nicer, character models are slightly more detailed, and everything moves a little more smoothly as you glide past at high speeds. It's not a huge bump, though, and it's still not quite as good-looking as the PC version was in 2013. Also, Re-Elected's only new gameplay features are a spate of neat-but-superfluous voice commands – which save you the trouble of using the d-pad to switch powers, or the pause menu to summon AI partners – and the option to use the PS4's touchpad during quick-time events, so there’s no real replay value if you played the original. Then again, Saints Row IV was never notable as a technical marvel. Its appeal comes more from bounding through its familiar, bland city of Steelport – now with an alien, intentionally glitchy-looking makeover – with upgradable superpowers that make its highly customizable vehicles completely obsolete after just a couple of hours. Its weapons are bizarre (and occasionally obscene), its character-customization options are wildly varied, and its map is littered with destructively fun things to do. And while its story missions annoyingly strip you of your powers, they compensate with unique and unexpected experiences that range from quasi-2D beat-'em-ups to narrated text adventures. In these respects, Re-Elected still holds up beautifully. It also piles on content, including two short expansions: Enter the Dominatrix, the deliberately unfinished DLC that Saints Row IV grew out of; and How the Saints Save Christmas, a cheesy adventure that involves mowing down malevolent gingerbread men in a bid to free Santa from alien captivity. The centerpiece, however, is Gat Out of Hell, a fun, four- to six-hour single-player or co-op adventure that sees Kinzie and Johnny Gat diving into Hell to rescue the President. Using Lucifer's stolen halo, the pair can use familiar superpowers to explore the underworld – which, despite being completely new, feels strangely like a smaller Steelport with an infernal re-skinning. However, being able to explore Hell by actually flying feels even more liberating than SRIV's jumping and gliding, and it makes hoovering up collectible power-up orbs even more enjoyable. And the new weapons, including a minigun-equipped armchair and the Ark of the Covenant – which uses enemies as ammo – are a blast for mowing down guardian demons. Interestingly, Gat Out of Hell doesn't really feature traditional story missions. Instead, it tasks you with completing handfuls of side activities for its condemned supporting characters, and triggers cutscenes once you've finished a certain number of them. It's an odd, somewhat repetitive approach, although making side tasks key to story progression does make them feel a lot more worthwhile. Especially because said story – which involves dead historical figures, fourth wall-breaking cameos, and a Disney-esque musical number -- is one of the more entertaining to come out of the series since, well, Saints Row IV itself. It's just a shame that Gat doesn't stand up quite as well as Re-Elected, performance-wise; not only does it look similarly last-gen, but at one point it bugged out badly on PlayStation 4, stuttering and halting until I reset it. It's also worth noting that while Gat comes on the Xbox One version's disc, playing it on PS4 requires a 7GB download using an included voucher. Saints Row IV is just as much silly, largely challenge-free fun in Re-Elected as it was originally, even if it doesn't look as impressive as other recent remasters. Gat out of Hell’s short but fun demonic adventure doesn’t really justify re-buying the whole thing, but the Re-Elected package is the best way to experience Saints Row IV’s power trip for the first time.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/13/idarb-review	 Watch a match of #IDARB, a 2D competitive multiplayer game for Xbox One, and nobody would blame you for feeling bewildered. It’s fast-paced, chaotic, and often incomprehensible, but the winning team didn’t get to the top of the leaderboard by chance. Part combo-based arcade game, part hockey, part basketball, and part Super Smash Bros., #IDARB is an intelligent, technical, and highly enjoyable little eSport. Just make sure you have a good number of players, or your teams will end up lopsided, bored, or both. #IDARB moves fast, and with two teams of two, matches are chaotic and ripe with opportunity for memorable plays. With four players on each team, #IDARB is borderline impossible to keep up with -- which makes playmakers feel all the better when a plan comes together. Setting up those big moments earns teams more points, too, and that’s the hook. Accuracy and precision takes skill, since you both move and aim with the left stick, and firing off a high-speed shot (or missing a pass) could cause the ball to bounce off the edges of the opponents’ net and back into your defensive zone. Everything about #IDARB relies on your reflexive, instant reactions to always-unpredictable events. Scoring is hard, but because #IDARB is so responsive and skill-centric, it makes getting a goal all the more rewarding -- and it gets even better as the player count increases.  Passing the ball to an airborne ally creates a combo multiplier that pays off with more points when they score, particularly if they’re farther away from the goal -- the farther you are, the more points you earn. The satisfaction of having a risky play send your score soaring over an opponent’s keeps both teams striving to make big moves. When a massive play failed, our room full of local players burst into hysterical screaming -- one side relieved, the other horrified, both ecstatic for their next opportunity. A team of two is enough to get in position, pass the ball between players, and score goals by throwing the ball into a blocky net. Skilled players reveal themselves when intercepting passes and setting up alley-oop shots. Causing turnovers by blasting the offender with a burst of energy is essential as well; it disjoints possession, sending the ball loose into the multi-tiered playing field. Erratic shifts in who’s carrying the ball causes frantic communication in teams who play to win, which is simultaneously part of what makes #IDARB entertaining, and why it’s smart. Clearly explaining where you are, when you’re available for a pass, and what you’re planning, is challenging but crucial. Helpful visual language, like the line popping out of players calling for passes, give ball-carriers information amid the babbling chaos of their couch competitors. And #IDARB is at its most enjoyable with a large competitive couch crew -- online multiplayer works, but I ran into persistent and significant problems. Most notably, it suffers from inconsistent latency issues that made each match a crap-shoot in performance; one would run smoothly, while the next had an unbearable frame rate that destroys the split-second timing that makes #IDARB a great game. Also, when playing alone at home, you can’t queue into a multiplayer game with custom settings -- playing alone means playing 1v1. Playing with one local pal means queuing into a 2v2, etc. #IDARB’s online multiplayer is neutered by an absence of matchmaking options, and I constantly wished I could jump into a four- or eight-player match when I didn’t have guests. This extends to local play somewhat as well. If you have, say, three or five players, the teams end up uneven, and there’s no way to fill the spot with an online player or A.I. bot -- and unbalanced teams led to one unhappy team every time.  Customization options are excellent, though. If you’re all-in on #IDARB, you can create your own character sprites using a simple sprite editor. It’s too small to allow for much sophistication, but it was enough to use that I could recreate my favorite Dota 2 Heroes, and recognize dozens of the pre-made Halo, The Walking Dead, Super TIME Force, and suspiciously Disney Princess-esque characters. Using your sprites, or the included ones, you can create teams for tournaments, as well as give them their own intro music using #IDARB’s easy-to-use and surprisingly great music tool. I spent a couple hours composing little themes, messing with drum rhythms, bass lines, and goofy sound effects, and found the editor fun to use because it’s simple without sacrificing depth. It only allows for four instrument layers, but it was sufficient enough for my musician coworkers to create awesome compositions. #IDARB is a jack-of-all-trades package. It brings a lot to the table -- frantic, intelligent competitive gameplay that’s fun to watch and play, plus easy-to-use music creation, simple sprite tools, and streaming options. With fewer than four players, IDARB sparks, but never quite catches fire. In a local environment, it’s madness at its best -- our spirited competition brought huge noise and joy to the room. Online options are seriously lacking, though, and you’re limited to just 1v1 matches if you’re the only one on your couch. But, with the right composition of friends holding controllers, IDARB becomes a ridiculous, intense sports game that is much smarter and more technical than its silly presentation may lead you to believe.
Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/12/assassins-creed-unity-dead-kings-dlc-review	 The Dead Kings DLC takes Assassin’s Creed: Unity somewhere the series has rarely gone before: underneath the streets as well as above them. Arno’s adventure in the dark and sometimes disorienting catacombs beneath Franciade changes up the established AC formula and provides some excellent opportunities for stealth, though Ubisoft once again fails to prop it up with a solid narrative. What most surprised me about this first DLC pack (other than its apologetic price tag of $0) is the sheer size of it. I'm not only referring to the scope and scale of the new city of Franciade (modern-day Saint-Denis), but also to how densely packed its streets, rooftops, graveyards, and catacombs are with new missions, activities, and collectibles.  While the new location itself is large - easily one-fourth the size of Ubisoft's Paris and bigger than the starting area of Versailles - the above-ground sections don't feel all that different from the areas that we left behind in Paris. Arno will still shove his way through the same crowds of repeated NPCs (that occasionally float over one another) and clamber over similar rooftops, so the only thing that separates these streets from those in Paris are the permanently overcast skies and a haunting layer of fog that blankets the city. It provides an interesting new aesthetic, but I was glad to see the familiar setting disappeared almost entirely once I descended into the labyrinthine tunnels that make up two of Franciade's five districts. Exploring the maze-like crypts and catacombs of Dead Kings is, at least at first, both entertaining and a refreshing spin on Unity's gameplay. These subterranean areas are much larger than I expected, and the tight, narrow passageways that give way to huge underground caverns help create a genuinely tense feeling of never knowing what’s around the next corner. Couple that with some of the simple-yet-satisfying puzzles found underground, and I half-expected Arno to don a whip and fedora and start grumbling about Atlantis. However, some of the winding corridors and overlapping pathways of this decidedly unique setting make it a bit too easy to get lost in the darkness, even when using map waypoints. After finding myself hopelessly lost for the fourth or fifth time, I realized that I had no desire to return to the underworld of Franciade after completing the main story missions (aside from my borderline compulsive need to collect everything).   The story certainly didn’t give me a reason to replay the new missions. Dead Kings’s plot spends its roughly two hours focused on Arno retrieving an artifact from deep within the tombs beneath Saint-Denis for the Marquis de Sade, but this simple heist becomes much too complicated much too quickly. Former allies become enemies with hardly any explanation, supernatural forces appear, and Arno even has his very own annoying Robin-style kid sidekick. It almost feels like four or five different storylines were shoehorned into one. Even so, these story missions provide some of the best stealth segments in recent Assassin’s Creed history, due in large part to the addition of a new enemy Raider faction. These treasure hunters for hire are individually weak, but only appear in large groups. The only way to avoid fighting each and every Raider is to locate and assassinate the group leader (or spending hours painstakingly avoiding detection). A foreman's death will cause the rest of the group to panic and scatter, which allows you to freely explore each cave and cavern. That’s a great incentive that created several exciting cat-and-mouse moments in almost every mission.  Dead Kings also whips up some new equipment for your Assassin's arsenal, and they feel specifically engineered to deal with these new threats. Items like the Guillotine Gun, with all the functionality of an axe duct-taped to a grenade launcher, provide fun and unique (and loud) solutions to the new combat scenarios. I'll admit that as a stealth-minded player I found it essentially useless while sneaking, but I can't deny the satisfying feeling of sending a whole group of flaming Raiders soaring through the air with one well-placed mortar bomb. Unfortunately, Dead Kings also introduces a refillable lantern which, outside of serving as an obscure plot device, is overused as a tool for navigating and unlocking many sections of the underground passages. While the use of fire and light adds a few clever puzzles to later missions, I couldn't help but roll my eyes every time I had to pull out my lantern just to scare away a group of roaches so that I could climb to the next ledge.  On the upside, the three new surface districts are full of collectibles, as well as the side activities that were the most enjoyable aspects of Unity's original release. Murder Mysteries, Paris Stories (Franciade Stories?), and even an updated version of the Nostradamus Enigma puzzles put the best of Unity's open world back in the spotlight, easily adding a few extra hours of things to do. They also included three new Far Cry-esque Outpost missions, which are challenging and fun to stealth your way through - though they lack replayability after the first or second attempt. Dead Kings offers a surprisingly large bundle of new content that expands and improves on some of the best aspects of Unity's gameplay. Despite a lackluster story and some unnecessary new obstacles, its large playable area and unique underground locations give you lots of opportunities to use its explosive new weaponry, hone your stealth or combat skills or simply experience more of what you enjoyed about Unity’s original release.
Miranda Sanchez	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/12/funk-of-titans-review	 For a game with a premise about representing and saving funk, a musical genre known for a smooth bass line that inevitably makes me sway, Funk of Titans is seriously lacking in groove. It’s a short endless runner that only begins to pick up speed by the time it ends, has a very confusing story, mostly dull level design and, strangest of all, boring music.  A few short text blurbs set up the vague plot: Zeus, who in this reality is a big fan of funk but not so much other music, assigns his son Perseus to fight and take down the titans of pop, rap, and rock. It’s not clear why their music is bad — at one point a character admits that pop music is really catchy — or why these other genres can’t peacefully coexist. But okay, let’s kill them. That’s a silly, absurdist premise that might’ve worked if properly developed... but Funk of Titans doesn’t even seem to try. Aside from a few stone hands making “rock on” signs in the Rock world, the three worlds’ environments don’t represent the genres they’re supposedly inhabited by at all. Instead, there’s a stereotypical ancient Greece setting for pop, a bland frozen wasteland for rap, and a rocky underworld (but not that kind of rock) for rock. Inexplicably, the worlds don’t even have background pop, rap, or rock music until you reach the boss. At least the cartoonish art style is pleasing, but only while you’re zoomed out – cutscenes and close-up interactions with characters reveal ugly models with bizarrely misshapen limbs. All of that is, of course, the icing on the mostly boring cake that is Funk of Titans’ gameplay. Most of the first 26 of its 39 platformer levels are too easy to be a challenge for even young gamers. This is a simplistic endless runner – it’s just A to jump and X to attack anything in the way. That’s fine if there’s an interesting series of obstacles to avoid, but there are shockingly few, and only three enemy types. Platforming through these levels virtually uncontested isn’t fun or satisfying. Only the final world’s 13 levels feature many new obstacles and objects, such as levers, cannons, and elevators. Where was all this stuff for the first two snooze-worthy worlds? Boss levels are even worse. Their biggest highlight is that I finally got to hear a bit of the music Zeus is trying to eliminate, and the bosses themselves are trippy (like the rock-themed centaur) but that’s about it. But the battles themselves are just three rounds of simple quick-time events. Funk of Titans does have a leveling system for progression, but even that was a bit convoluted. To level Perseus up, I needed to complete Zeus’ Heroic Missions, which weren’t really all that heroic. For the most part they completed themselves, since many objectives were things like “Jump 75 times.” Leveling didn’t seem very important either, as it only unlocks items in the shops. Most are purely cosmetic helmets, though a few are required to complete Heroic Missions. The weapons are also mostly cosmetic, but a select few will break special barriers that block the way to the special minigame item found in levels, the Pegasus. They may not do much, but at least the Star Wars or Lego references in these items makes Funk of Titans a little less dull.  For almost the entirety of the two and half hours it took me to complete Funk of Titans, I was bored. The world design is awkward, and for a game about music, it lacked a variety of catchy tunes or even appropriate themes. I chuckled a bit at the silly hats and weapons, and some of the final levels showed a spark of life, but Funk of Titans is ultimately an unsatisfying experience.
Brendan Graeber	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/12/sunset-overdrive-mystery-of-the-mooil-rig-dlc-review	 It may be hard to picture an off-shore oil rig as a colorful and unique place, but Sunset Overdrive’s outrageous and vibrant treatment at least briefly pulls that off in the Mystery of the Mooil Rig DLC. This brand-new area just outside of Sunset City includes a new batch of weapons, amps, collectibles, and more, but the biggest reinvigoration is a set of traversal methods that let you dive, dash, and leap across the water with Aquaman-like speed.  Seven story missions reunite you with the bionic Troop Master Bryllcream, who proves his worth in hilarious fashion by launching you face-first at the opposition. Sadly, the only thing new about this variety of OD is a fresh coat of petroleum and seaweed – a simple reskin of the original enemies – as they don’t offer any new challenges or opportunities for new tactics beyond the occasional pool of ignitable oil. The hostile scab workers are also more of the same. The Mooil Rig itself, on the other hand, is a wonderful extension of developer Insomniac’s level design. Its brightly colored shipping crates, life rafts, and shipwrecks offer platforms with a great deal of verticality. The new aquatic traversal methods make zipping around the new area easy and fun as you dodge massive tentacles that destroy platforms left and right, or protect targets from incoming mortar fire. It’s all backdropped by a picturesque sunset that frequently bathes you in orange hues as you glide across the water. In the weapons department, this DLC is batting .500. One of my prayers from the main campaign is answered here with the Feel The Burn, a close-range flamethrower. However, the Rivet Blaster, which you can only buy after finishing the missions, feels out of place on the oil rig. It’s great against robots, but there aren’t any here. While Mystery of the Mooil Rig is delightfully varied by having you pilot the Glider one moment, and chasing a giant tentacled beast the next, the whole thing feels like just the tip of an iceberg that melted before I could get my fill. I managed to complete everything in around four or five hours – and that included all of the story missions, two side-quests, 20 collectibles, and handful of challenges. It’s definitely time well-spent, though, and the excellent humor that had me chuckling frequently. There’s plenty of pop-culture nods, and Insomniac isn’t afraid to point out after a Psycho-themed sidequest that, “The saddest part about that whole thing is, most people under 30 won’t get the reference.” For all the laughs however, the story barely has enough time to lay itself out before it’s all over, and the main objective of the story-based DLC ended so suddenly I wondered if I’d missed the punchline. Thankfully, the story culminates with a decent final boss fight that lets you switch up your tactics, and incorporates your buddy Bryllcream in an ingenious fashion.  You’re rewarded for the quick romp with two new guns and amps that prove useful both on the oil rig and back in the main map, as well as the ability to use your new water traversal methods back in Sunset City. There are a lot of laughs in The Mystery of the Mooil Rig. A great new location, some creative missions, and a much-needed flamethrower make this off-shore excursion entertaining, but it felt like it ended just as it was getting started.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/31/the-walking-dead-a-telltale-game-series-season-2-review	" ""Hope"" is one quality that you will find quite little of in Robert Kirkman's graphic novel series, and the same goes for the TV show and now game series that it inspired. Dire circumstances and consequential choices continue to hang heavy on Season 2 of Telltale's The Walking Dead game series. Whereas the first game at least gave players two protagonists who could rely on each other as they faced the bitter reality of a walker-overrun world, Season 2 focuses on young Clementine and her desperate, lonely battle for survival. Though she will meet other living souls along her journey, her life ultimately depends on the choices and actions that she makes ... the choices that you, the player, will make. IGN has individually reviewed all five episodes of The Walking Dead: A Telltale Game Series -- Season 2. You can find links to these episode reviews for The Walking Dead: Season 2 through the links below. You can also read IGN's reviews for episodes of The Walking Dead: Season 1, The Walking Dead: A New Frontier, and The Walking Dead: Michonne Miniseries to catch up with each season of the game.    The Walking Dead: Season 2, Episode 1 Review -- All That Remains VERDICT: Season 2’s premiere of The Walking Dead is predictable in good and bad ways — its character drama is strong, its technical prowess is not. Clementine’s character development highlights the fact that she was a secondary character, someone to look out for, in the first season. Here, she’s come into her own, learned from the Lee Everett we knew more about, and is stronger than she’s ever been — both as a person and a story’s subject. For now, Season 2’s meandering main story is too vague to be exciting right now, but if the writing so far is indicative of how Telltale will handle the remaining episodes, The Walking Dead could bottle lightning twice.     The Walking Dead: Season 2, Episode 2 Review -- A House Divided VERDICT: Episode 2 of The Walking Dead: Season 2 is one of the best Telltale has ever made. It’s big, full of great dialogue, devastating consequences, memorable and fun action scenes, and places a smart, scary plot at center stage. Clementine’s character growth remains the most interesting aspect of Season 2, and The Walking Dead is walking her down a more brutal, disturbing path than ever before.     The Walking Dead: Season 2, Episode 3 Review -- In Harm's Way VERDICT: Speaking with friends around a campfire, or fighting zombies to save their lives, humanizes The Walking Dead’s cast better than most games characterize their protagonist. My dialogue choices reflect what Clementine and her friends need, rather than what I stand to gain as a player. In Harm’s Way deepened my empathy for characters I’m legitimately worried will die, or worse. Sometimes, I made choices in hopes that I could stop that from happening. I put others before myself, and that got a lot of us hurt, Clementine included. Maybe these were the wrong choices. I don’t know. I’d rather not think about it -- but I can’t stop.     The Walking Dead: Season 2, Episode 4 Review -- Amid The Ruins VERDICT: As ever, I’m confident in Telltale Games’ ability to tell a strong story and end it with panache, but Episode 4: Amid the Ruins is the weakest episode of The Walking Dead: Season 2. Despite its major changes -- both regarding Clementine as a character and the roles of those around her -- there are too many out-of-left-field events to build tension convincingly. I’m excited for the conclusion -- but I’m not in love with the way we got there.     The Walking Dead: Season 2, Episode 5 Review -- No Going Back VERDICT: It is surprising how much The Walking Dead: Season 2’s finale accomplishes in just two hours. Each scene studies a set of characters, analyzing their goals, their nature, and what they’ve become in the two years since the undead started roaming. No Going Back poses challenging questions about people you love, people you might be using, and those you might loathe. It is, ultimately, a test of these characters’ wills, and a look at each of their limits. Telltale Games crafted brilliant no-win scenarios for Clementine, and the outcome of each is a result of what your Clementine is willing to say, lose, or do for herself or her family. Sometimes, those two can’t be reconciled, which leads to devastating conclusions. This is perhaps the most heartbreaking and tense episode of anything Telltale has ever made. How Clementine braces for the impact of everything in front of her is up to you -- and where that takes her left me in awe."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/18/destiny-the-dark-below-review	 If someone had secretly installed Destiny’s first expansion, The Dark Below, onto my hard drive without telling me, it would’ve taken me a while to notice. To call it an “expansion” is generous, roughly equivalent to calling a moped a motorcycle. The dearth of completely new content for the price is only half of the problem here though; the other half is how recycled and tacked on nearly every element feels.  Let’s get this right out of the way: the new raid, Crota’s End, is the best, and perhaps only reason to purchase The Dark Below. Just as the Vault of Glass raid did for the core Destiny experience, Crota’s End introduces objective-based gameplay that’s more interesting and varied than anything else you’ll find in this add-on. It’s an infuriating peek at the excellent game Destiny could be – provided that you have five friends with level 28 characters you can round up via text message or phone (seeing as there still isn’t any raid matchmaking). That inconvenience alone is frustrating enough, but it’s compounded by how little there is to do in The Dark Below aside from the new raid. I blazed through the three story missions and the one new strike in under two hours, and in that time, I saw barely anything substantial that I hadn’t seen in Destiny before. A strong sensation of déjà vu crept in as I tore through Earth and moon areas I’ve visited and revisited countless times since Destiny’s initial launch. The strike mission felt particularly samey, lacking the extra challenge and sense of urgency that make the original group of strikes my go-to grinding activity. Also disappointing is how The Dark Below fails to flesh out Destiny’s anemic story content. There was an opportunity here to take a more active approach to storytelling, but developer Bungie passes on it, opting to stick with expository dumps before and after missions to inform us why we should care about the things we’re about to shoot. It didn’t work for the core game, and it doesn’t work here either. In the time it’s taken me to write this much, I’ve already forgotten what I did or why I did it. Sure, it’s a new voice feeding us the story, but that doesn’t make what’s being said any more interesting.  That voice belongs to Eris, a new NPC standing around in the tower, handing out new bounties to pursue. Well, kind of new. Essentially, these are the same “kill X number of Y” tasks you’ve been doing, though they sometimes have minor twists, like a requirement to use a specific damage or weapon type. The main reason to do these is to increase your faction standing with Eris in order to purchase new cosmetic items and…that’s about it. She’ll toss you a new weapon every now and again, but for the most part, she offers little more than meaningless stuff to grind for, and Destiny already had plenty of that. In fact, there’s even more of that meaninglessness in The Dark Below, thanks to the fact that the new raid gear you earn from Crota’s End requires an entirely new resource to upgrade – a resource you can only earn by running the raid over and over and over. So yeah, you can use that fancy new gear you earned wherever you want, you aren’t going to progress with it. This narrows the experience even further for high-level players.  Of course, none of this changes that Destiny is still fundamentally sound in the mechanics department. The act of combat isn’t any less enjoyable in The Dark Below, but it’s no more enjoyable either. Yeah, some Hive Knights will drop the same sword we played with for one mission in the original (which is a blast while it lasts), and you get a hoverbike that can do backflips in mid-air, but neither addition is supported by gameplay that makes them feel necessary or even useful. The Dark Below is a huge missed opportunity, a mish-mash of recycled ideas and content that fails to reinvigorate Destiny or address any of its biggest problems. The new raid is great, and the combat is as strong as it was before, but the new progression systems are limited and ultimately unrewarding, leaving me to wonder where Destiny will wind up if this is a sign of what’s to come.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/16/kalimba-review	 Throughout Kalimba’s many color-coded puzzles, I probably swapped the positions of my two grim-faced totem pieces over a thousand times. Far less frequent, but far more dramatic, were my shifts from marveling at the clever tandem-character puzzle-platforming (the gameplay equivalent of patting my head while rubbing my belly) to frustration at some iffy anti-gravity physics and disappointment at the plain presentation. But I always quickly shifted back to enjoying it, especially in the demanding two-player co-op levels.  While Kalimba's minimal visual style, scarce soundtrack, and mostly-forgettable dialogue are all a bit basic, simplicity is molded into something special when it comes to the puzzle-platforming level design. In single-player, it's all about guiding my totem pieces through obstacle-course levels; if either piece touches a liquid that isn't their color or an enemy (provided you're not larger than one), both pieces die and are sent back to a generously placed checkpoint. While overcoming obstacles usually requires stacking the two and switching their placement (which happens instantly at the touch of a button), certain sequences require using obstacles in the level to put space between your pieces and being carefully aware of their movement. Throughout my five-hour single-player journey, there were enough tweaks to the formula that I felt challenged and interested in what new ideas the next level would add. Whether I was flying through the air via trampolines and cannons, or experimenting with elements that mess with the normally parallel movement and make one of the characters larger or stationary, most of the additions to Kalimba's solid platforming and puzzle mechanics are welcome. The only parts I wasn't fond of were those that relied heavily on puzzles where gravity is reversed for one of the totems, causing the one on top to walk on the ceiling, and the way they bounce off each other meant dealing with very touchy physics. When I got a top score for finishing a level without dying and collecting all 70 items stashed within, I felt a sense of pride few games have given to me lately. Typically, when I made a mistake near the end that ruined such a run I'd curse, but there was an undercurrent of happiness – a feeling that I was just a retry away from attaining perfection. However, when a slightly mistimed anti-gravity move shot a totem into an obstacle, the lack of control in these situations led to more anger and less motivation to return to a level. Those aren’t too frequent, though, and it's to Kalimba's credit that I’ve felt an urge to return to its world since completing the campaign, thanks to a multitude of additional modes. I've made a few valiant-yet-ill-fated attempts to conquer “Old School” mode, where high scoring runs are the only way to add to a very limited supply of lives. Kalimba's co-op campaign, where each player controls a pair of totems of one color through specifically-designed levels, is an additional treat that taxed my brain in a whole new way: I had to verbalize solutions to a partner and sometimes synchronize movement to a degree that illustrates why Kalimba's co-op is strictly local. I’m eagerly awaiting completion of co-op to unlock Shorthanded mode, where I'll have to control both of the co-op totem pairs on a single controller (it reminds me of the underappreciated PS2 puzzler Cookies and Cream). Unfortunately, some of that sense of progress was stymied by a bug that erased more than half of my single-player progress and some of my co-op work when I was switching between apps. The publisher has stated that this will be fixed in time for launch, but I haven’t been able to verify that fix yet. Much as it might take close examination to appreciate the amazing craftsmanship of a totem pole, the plain presentation of Kalimba shouldn't turn you away from the originality and fun harnessed locked within this puzzle-platformer. Save for a few puzzles that lose luster due to unintuitive and touchy physics, I mostly enjoyed testing both my platforming timing and my problem-solving skills with Kalimba's brain-busters.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	 A puzzle game should be quick and easy to pick up and play, but deep and challenging enough that it’s difficult to put down - that’s the cliche ideal. Threes is the embodiment of that ideal. Its elegantly simple matching gameplay and surprising layer of charm and subtle personality put it up there with the classic Tetris as one of the very best of their kind. A four-by-four grid full of numbered cards makes Threes look like a math-based game at first glance, but there’s virtually no calculation involved in this mental exercise. Simply swiping up, down, right, or left causes all cards on the board to move one space in that direction (if possible), and matching cards that are pushed against an edge combine and collapse them into a single, higher-value card. For example, smooshing a 3 into another 3 makes a 6; smooshing that 6 against another 6 creates a 12, and so on. Every move you make adds pressure by bringing in a new card from the opposite side. This simple idea grows increasingly complex and tough when the board inevitably fills up with cards, and space becomes scarce. Getting a high score and topping the leaderboards – the sole goal of Threes’ only mode – becomes all about learning to see several moves ahead, and visualizing what the board will look like after several swipes and card combinations. You can “peek” by sliding a card most of the way over to see what the board will look like (on the Xbox One, this is done with the right stick). But because of the random placement of new cards in one of the four slots on the side opposite your last move, Threes isn’t a solvable puzzle or a fair and level playing field, and that means it’s endlessly challenging. It’s similar to the brinksmanship created by luck of the draw in Tetris, when you risk everything betting that a long piece will finally materialize at the last possible moment before the board fills up. What’s more, the brilliant puzzle is set to a catchy, accordion-heavy theme song that feels like something out of a Parisian cafe. Even though it’s just one track, it’s long and sufficiently varied that I’m still humming along after hearing it literally hundreds of times – in fact, it’s often playing in my head even when Threes isn’t running. Sound design is also brilliant, granting each numbered card a distinct voice and personality – something I wouldn’t have thought possible upon hearing the description of its simple look. The high-pitched and childlike “Hello!” of the 3, the “Sup?” from 6, 48’s dopey “Oh garsh,” 96’s angry-sounding “Grrrr,” 192’s snobby “Hello gentlemen,” and so on often trigger when numbers appear, and they’ll let out exasperated sighs or prod you with “Go already!” when you take too long (for their taste - there’s no actual time limit) to consider your move, and a “nope!” or “nuh-uh” dismisses your attempts at invalid moves. All the voices have several different takes on their lines, and they don’t play at every opportunity, ensuring they don’t quickly wear out their welcome. Threes is a brilliant puzzle game that can pass spare minutes, hours, or pretty much however long you’ve got. Its simple matching mechanics take only moments to learn, but training yourself to see several moves ahead while anticipating the possible variables is a challenge that’s gripped the puzzle center of my brain as tightly as classics like Tetris ever did. An unexpected element of outstanding music and personality makes every game a pleasure, even if my scores can’t top the leaderboard.
Zack Stein	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/just-dance-2015-review	 Two words sum up the five-year-old Just Dance series: “predictable” and “fun.” You know you’ll get recent pop hits, a few disco classics, and a smattering of novelty tunes, accompanied by color-saturated videos displaying simple dance moves for you to imitate. And you’ll earn some points, whether you’re trying your best or napping on the couch. But with impressive video production, more precise player tracking (thanks to the Xbox One’s Kinect, which is all but required to play), and a fully realized social component, Just Dance 2015 is a welcome, surprising reinvigoration of the series.  The 45 songs included in Just Dance 2015 are mostly of the pop variety, including recent earworms such as Pharrell’s “Happy,” “Let it Go” from Disney’s Frozen, and Katy Perry’s “Birthday,” but there are several curveballs as well. Classics like “Ain’t No Mountain High Enough” from Marvin Gaye and Tammi Terrell sit alongside “Holding Out for a Hero” by Bonnie Tyler and “Xmas Tree” by Bollywood Santa. Want to dance to the Tetris theme? It’s in there as well, along with Frankie Bostello’s “Mahna Mahna” (which you probably know from The Muppets). You truly see your moves registering on the Kinect, and the sense of accomplishment from nailing a move is that much more gratifying because of it. However, while Just Dance 2015 is better at rewarding good dancing than past versions, it’s “points-for-all” scoring system means anyone who’s detected by the Kinect will end up with a score, regardless of whether they were moving at all. That forgiving nature will always be its Achilles heel, and reduces the sense that a high score was well earned. Dance Central this isn’t. I’m not much of a dancer, and I wasn’t any better after playing, but that’s just fine with Just Dance. It’s more about having fun while moving to the beat. I’m guessing professional dancers look at Just Dance the way professional drivers might look at the Burnout series. These aren’t moves you’ll pull off in real life, but they’re certainly fun in a video game. The Kinect controls are responsive, but my family and I often found ourselves reaching for the controller to navigate the menus. It’s just faster and easier, but even then, the menu and navigational systems continue to be as confusing and frustrating as ever. The new glossy look and fun graphical touches can’t hide some of the mind-boggling decisions made as to how this whole thing operates. For instance, you can’t just hit B to go back. Whether you picked the wrong song, or you’re looking for a different menu, you have to wait for a back button to appear at the top right, move the cursor up there, and then click. And the badges icon on the home screen that tells you how many you’ve earned -- that’s not a button. To actually look at your rewards, that’s a different button top right. Considering all the other upgrades Just Dance has received, it’s time the menus and navigation received the TLC they deserve. The one thing it does very right, though, is the voice-activated “Just Dance!” command that gets you right into the action once you’ve selected your song. That never got old. Up to six people can dance at once locally, and players can jump in and out of a song as they please, making it ideal for parties or ending fights between children. And while I’m 6’4” and my youngest is three feet tall, we were both seen and scored appropriately (I won!). Then my wife and my seven-year-old joined in, and Just Dance 2015 adjusted without a hitch (my wife won).  Where you’ll really see Ubisoft’s effort is in the music videos for the dance numbers. While Just Dance has always been a celebration of color saturation, this year’s videos are, for the most part, much more creative and unique. For instance, this version of Katy Perry’s “Dark Horse” is inspired by the original, Egyptian-themed music video. A lead dancer, initially dressed as Cleopatra, morphs throughout the song into a variety of elaborate costumes. A chorus of digitally added dancers backs her up across a variety of dissolving Egyptian backgrounds, and it’s all impressively choreographed and lit. It’s truly entertaining, even if you’re a wallflower. Meanwhile, the evolution of Just Dance into a multiplayer game has made huge strides this year. The series has flirted with social interaction in the past, but Just Dance 2015 is a full-fledged virtual dance party. Hopping onto the World Dance Floor takes you to a lobby where you can choose to dance against another player one on one, or jump right into a dance party with up to eight players competing for the high score. It all worked seamlessly, free of hiccups or lag. Another social addition to Just Dance 2015 is the ability to take on a “ghost dancer” challenger, which reenacts another player’s high-scoring performance on screen and reveals how it was done as you compete against it. Similar features have long been a motivating part of racing games, and it’s nice to see this integrated so well here. Watching videos uploaded by other dancers around the world is strangely compelling, and it’s fun to see how your videos have been received by the community. The Video Gallery is also proof that there are a lot of good dancers out there, and that Just Dance players are quite the diverse bunch. If you don’t have a Kinect, you can play Just Dance 2015 by downloading the Just Dance Motion Controller app to your smartphone, using the motion of your phone to track your moves -- like a hi-tech maraca. It absolutely dilutes the experience, but it is an option. It would be easy to dismiss Just Dance 2015 as the “same-old-same-old,” but that would overlook this finely tuned party game’s special-effects-laden dance numbers, complete with chorus lines and elaborate sets and costumes, and the social integration that holds the world-wide Just Dance community together. Though its overeagerness to hand out points and make everyone feel like a winner robs it of some competitive value, Just Dance 2015 just works as a fun, get-up-and-move game, with a wink and smile along the way.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	" Returning to the isometric-perspective template set by Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light after watching Lara’s personality shine in last year’s Tomb Raider reboot seemed disappointing at first, but Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris was quick to remind me that energetic adventure through visually impressive locations and dangerous, puzzle-filled ruins is what this series is all about. This story-light, puzzle-heavy, co-op adventure is almost as essential as Lara's third-person excursions.  There's really only one thing missing from this version of Lara Croft: personality. The high-angle isometric perspective may work in terms of showing large sections of the visually distinct temples and properly framing the brain-bending puzzles, but even when engaging in rare banter with her team of co-op allies, this iconic adventurer heroine doesn't show anything resembling emotion or even vulnerability as we watch her explore the gorgeous yet dangerous environments from afar. It’s the Temple of Osiris itself that fills that void with creative level designs: From the lavish golden flourishes of a mirror-based temple to creepy green eyes adorning the poison-tinged traps, the biggest carrot dangling in front of me wasn't the resolution of Lara's battle against the Egyptian god Set or more loot, it was seeing what new hazardous wonders awaited Lara Croft and company. Much like Lara Croft's original adventures, combat in Temple of Osiris largely exists to fill the gaps between puzzles. While there's a level of excitement that accompanies testing every new gun as you find them – machine-gun pistols, a magic staff, a rocket launcher, and a high-powered rifle – the resurrected rank and file populating Egypt never really poses much of a fight, save for a few boss fights and wave-based battle challenges available in the hub world. Fortunately, the obstacles put in Lara's path more than make up for the average gunplay. The pacing of the puzzles throughout this six-hour adventure is the key. As you start each of the nine tombs you're given an introduction to the core puzzle type, whether it be reflecting the orb-destroying beam from the staff of Osiris, lighting torches that power gates, or finding the correct path through spike-laden grounds that escalate quickly into some truly tricky trials at the end of an excavation.In addition to the stages througout the campaign, there are also five ""Challenge Tombs,"" each featuring a puzzle even tougher than the mandatory stuff.  What’s really impressive is how the puzzles in Temple of Osiris scale in scope when you’re playing them by yourself or with a party of up to four. Where a solo puzzle had me pushing combustible orbs to temporarily depress switches or using my momentum while rappelling down a wall, replaying it with partners added variables. Switches would be moved to different areas, orbs would removed entirely, and brick walls would be put where a clear path used to be in order to force teamwork and communication. It's a bit jarring to go from having a full suite of puzzle-solving tools on hand as a soloing Lara to depending on one of the two magician class characters to properly wield the essential Staff of Osiris.I found my couch co-op experience far more conducive to the adventure than playing online; I could easily point my partner to a specific spot where I wanted them to go, or even switch controllers if I felt their skills were better suited to use the archaeologist-exclusive grappling hook to solve a given puzzle. When playing online, those things become a bit tricker, but either way, working out a complex puzzle with a friend or team is even more fulfilling than solving a single-player stumper. Additionally, a strictly solo experience won't include cooler, action-packed co-op activities like flanking enemies, rappelling off a partner, or doing a tightrope walk between two tethered friends. Playing solo, the first run-through for each of the nine temples took 15 to 20 minutes, though there's are plenty of reason for return visits. Beyond gathering the new weapons, you can collect gems to spend on treasure chests that contain one of two accessories. More common are rings that can increase attributes like bomb radius or rate of fire, but often detract from another, such as defense level. Even rarer are items that change your projectile weaponry to add fire damage or transfer enemy damage into your health. However, since rings only affect combat, which isn’t anything special, their usefulness is limited. I wish the amulets could have come into play a bit more, but they're only activated after amassing multiple kills or collecting a lot of gems, and the effects run out pretty fast. Additionally, the amount of single-hit kill obstacles like spikes or pits that drain your entire combo meter in death often render amulets useless. That led to a trickle-down effect where jostling co-op partners for our own gem collections wasn't as competitive as it could be, since the bigger-ticket collectibles like permanent stat boosts and new weapons are shared amongst the group. The real treasure in Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris wasn't Lara’s story, bipedal alligator warriors, or a bounty of gems, but solving complex and varied environmental puzzles with friends. Playing alone, discovering the different flavors of each new temple and figuring out the solution to a brain-busting puzzle all by myself is satisfying; replaying with others doubled that satisfaction because developer Crystal Dynamics renews the challenge with creative new twists on previously conquered obstacles that require teamwork to overcome."
Nathan Lawrence	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/rugby-15-review	 Rugby union fans have been starved for authentic video game representations of their beloved sport for years now, with the last truly strong rugby game being Rugby 08. Sadly, Rugby 15 is not the game to break the drought. In fact, it’s an utter disaster. Of all the various sports that share the ‘football’ classification, rugby union is one of the trickiest for newcomers to wrap their heads around thanks to a myriad of rules and complexities. While scoring points is the same logic as other forms of football—getting a ball across a try line or kicking a ball between goal posts—converting kick-off to try time involves a number of key set pieces. Mauling... For instance, ground is gained by a kicking game, that’s governed by specific rules of whether the ball lands out on the full, bounces before the out-of-play line or is caught on the full behind the 22-metre line and ‘marked’. The team in possession of the ball can run as many phases as they like, unless there’s an infringement or they kick the ball. When tackled, the player holding the ball must release it, as players from both sides pile in and form a ruck, which can only be entered from the side. Scrums and mauls can be used to drive the ball across the try line or gain precious metres, while line-out kicks are essential for gaining ground. In short, rugby union is a tricky game to learn, and developer HB Studios deserves kudos for condensing the complexities of the game into a relatively simple arcade-style control scheme. Unfortunately, for gamers hoping Rugby 15 will be the gateway to understanding union, there’s a lack of a meaningful tutorial, or any specific training modes for the various components of the sport. Instead, you’ll have to learn by way of ten static training screens and in-game control reminders. For the most part, the controls are all very easy to come to grips with, but it almost instantly comes apart after kick-off. As I played, it became increasingly clear to me that the gameplay stops and starts based on what the player is doing. While it’s nice to be at the centre of the action, it makes for boring rugby, as both sides stand around waiting for you to act. For instance, at kick-off, your AI teammates only start moving after you’ve fully completed the drop-kick start of play, and the kicker stands stuck on the spot for a second or two before being able to move. Even if you switch players immediately after kicking, it’s impossible to perform cheeky ten-metre starts/restarts that give you the opportunity to gain possession and make easy ground. Similarly, there were times when I pulled the ball out of the back of a ruck and just stood there watching the opposing team stand around, oblivious to my possession until I took a step forward. The best tactics were to deliberately relinquish possession to gain easy metres. I found the most successful and repeatable tactic, regardless of difficulty level, was to perform a box-kick from the back of a ruck to gain ground. As long as the kick stayed on the field and outside of the 22-metre line (where the AI will take a mark), it’s incredibly easy to force a turnover. ...stomping... Basic tackling is as easy as guiding your selected player into the opposing player with the ball. Or any opposing player for that matter, as you never seem to get penalised for tackling players that aren’t carrying the ball. In fact, outside of ruck infringements, I rarely got penalised for anything. Forward passes were never noticed or penalised, whether performed by me or the opposing team, and off-side penalties were only awarded about ten percent of the time. As for ruck penalties, they’re incredibly easy to avoid. Once the player carrying the ball is tackled, you have to push the right stick into a predetermined sweet spot that rushes from red to yellow to green, then you can take possession of the ball. Attempting to take the ball when the meter is red results in an instant penalty; yellow is a risky grab that may result in a penalty (and is, surprisingly, easier to get away with in hard difficulty); while green is safe to grab, except when the referee erroneously pings you from time to time for a legal grab. The ruck mechanic is glitchy when in possession of the ball, meaning I had to hit the right trigger to release the ball before attempting to play the meter game. If I didn’t do this, Rugby 15 stopped registering controller input for a few precious seconds. This is a problem that plagues that PlayStation 3 version of the game more than anything else (also outside of rucks). Given the specific way you’re forced to ruck, it’s best not to be in possession of the ball until you’re within ten metres of the try line, so you don’t have to deal with the incredible frustration of losing possession because the game bugs out. Even on the supposedly hard difficulty, it’s incredibly easy to win back possession in a ruck once you learn the right-stick sweet spot and perfect timing combination. By far the biggest problem I had with Rugby 15, though, was that it rarely felt as though skill or tactics played into scoring tries. When running with the ball, you can flick the right stick up or down, or twirl the stick around completely, to sidestep opponents, but even that mechanic only seemed to work sporadically for me. The game seems to predetermine the outcome of specific plays before the animation occurs, resulting in an inability to pass the ball if it decides you’re about to be tackled, or a lack of a sidestep if that stationary player in front of your guy is destined to take you down. Similarly, partial AI control over the player-controlled footballer means that sidesteps and fends automatically occur at the game’s discretion, while players will regularly run off on their own accord, even if they have the human-controlled icon above their heads. It feels more like rugby roulette than rugby union. ...kicking balls. What a sport! When you eventually make it to the trial-and-error-style try-scoring mechanic, you’ll discover that there are two ways to score a try. The first, game-encouraged option is to click in the left or right stick to score a try. This proved to be a risky manoeuvre, though, as full-speed players had a tendency to dive over the dead-ball line, resulting in a penalty. Even the opposing team was guilty of this on one occasion, in an uncontested try opportunity. The second, guaranteed option for scoring a try is to run your player over the try line and wait to be tackled. There’s no option to get a player beneath a try attempt to stop them touching down the ball, and a button for charging down a kick is sorely lacking. While there’s no sprint option, stamina didn’t appear to come into play (despite its presence in the options menu), and pursuing players rarely catch up to a running player, even if their stats determine they should be able to. There are rare moments where the intended gameplay formula bounces to the top of the heap, and local co-op/competitive play improves the rhythm as it helps get around dealing with the atrocious AI. Local multiplayer has its own specific issues, however, particularly in regard to the weird system of tracking and switching players during co-op. It’s worth noting the game looks decidedly last-gen, with dated visuals that can become confusing in certain matches where jersey colours are indistinguishable between friend and foe, especially when you consider how frequently players flock in front and behind the off-side line. The PlayStation 3 version of Rugby 15 is particularly ugly, with a lower resolution, darker presentation, plenty of jaggies and a terrible frame rate, to boot. Combine the unappealing visual presentation with the aforementioned game woes, and the PS3 version is unplayable in its current form. I went in to Rugby 15 with the hope that the arcade presentation would result in a fun, pick-up-and-play rugby game, but my expectations were quickly tackled by a never-ending stream of bugs and paradoxical design decisions. Overall, this is an experience that’s so broken it’s hard to recommend. The best thing you can do is pass.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	 The Crew is an immense and unique online-only racing game that, above all else, boasts an ambitious open world of such preposterous proportions it ought to rank amongst some of the year’s most remarkable technical accomplishments. Its size, however, has taken a toll on The Crew’s visuals and effects, and its problems don’t stop there. Sound generally lacks oomph, the economy is stingy, the multiplayer community is only loosely connected, and the missions are too often undermined by some incredibly frustrating AI that brazenly cheats in a misguided attempt to ratchet up the tension. What The Crew gets right is its stylised and scaled-down version of the entire continental USA. Cities are shrunken caricatures, but the truly vast sweeping tracts of land between them means traversing it really does capture the spirit of a cross-country, city-to-city road trip better than any driving game before it. Plenty of racing games curate a bunch of different backdrops into their track selections, from urban street races in major American metropolitan centres to icy blasts across snow-swept mountains, flat-out sprints across the baking desert, or muddy expeditions through giant Sequoia forests. The Crew admirably does all this in a single game world you can drive across in one lengthy session. This girth has come at a cost, though. It’s a world that looks fine whipping by you at speed, but it favours sheer size over the kind of granular detail we now expect in modern open world racers. Cities are smattered with recognisable landmarks but don’t really seem built to stand up to stationary scrutiny. Combined with low-detailed NPC cars (complete with entirely black, opaque glass), some forgettable effects (splashing water is especially dire), no weather, and the fact that the models of the 40-or-so cars are in a league below those of contemporaries like Forza Horizon 2 or Driveclub, The Crew struggles to shake the look of a game several years older than it actually is.  There is, however, a charming sort of daftness to this condensed ode to the US. The Crew’s version of Californian race track Laguna Seca is hopelessly primitive compared to the renditions available in dedicated tracks racers like Gran Turismo 6 or Forza Motorsport 5, but being able to drive off of it in real time, leave the facility and be drifting around a space shuttle in Cape Canaveral on the other side of the country within the hour has a certain infectious appeal about it. The Crew bills itself as an MMO but it felt largely like a single-player experience my first time through the campaign. There were definitely other players on the map in my vicinity, but I only rarely saw another car close up, and only twice all week was I invited by a random stranger to join his or her co-op mission. I tried on multiple occasions to trigger co-op missions myself but these invitations time out if nobody accepts them, and time out they did. I found myself launching the missions solo rather than waiting patiently for no-one to respond. I’d suggest finding some like-minded friends to play the co-op story missions with rather than relying on the game to find willing strangers from your session, as it feels like the most reliable way to experience co-op in The Crew. It’s certainly the most entertaining way to play it, and it only takes one human player to nab the objective for all of you to successfully complete the mission. It also means you’ll have a better chance of emerging victorious against the often overpowered AI and makes the sometimes irksome takedown missions a lot less punishing, considering there will be up to four of you trying to slam a single vehicle off the road. Said overpowered AI is perhaps the most frustrating trait of The Crew; it’s obsessed with making sure the computer-controlled opponents you face, race, or chase in the game’s solo and co-op missions can always keep up with you, regardless of how completely outclassed by high-level cars they should be. It’s especially exasperating towards the game’s end. The supposed difficulty of an event is determined by what your car performance level is compared to what’s recommended. The thing is, I’d attempted to complete a race with a car level a fraction below what was recommended and found it impossible to keep up with the pack. It seemed like a reasonable enough outcome until I went back to replay a previously completed race, against cars with a significantly lower car level than mine, and found I simply couldn’t pull away. In fact, some of them were blitzing past me, even after they’d crashed out just a minute before. Normalising the AI to be able to match pace with the monster you’re driving undermines the whole upgrade system. It also extends to the AI-driven cop and enemy cars, who have a supernatural ability to bend the game’s driving physics to their whims and capture you surprisingly rapidly, even if you’re reversing away from them at full throttle with nobody blocking the road behind you.  The Crew is an arcade racing experience through and through, and it’s one that actually improves as you progress and your cars’ stats are buoyed by earning vague performance parts via completed missions and driving challenges. These challenges, which test your speed, control, and off-road abilities, are dotted all over the map and can be triggered on the fly, and the process of picking one up is seamless… until you succeed, at which point the barrage of overlays beaming numbers into your brain concludes with a short loading screen, after which you’ll find your car stopped dead in its tracks. It’s a real momentum killer. At any rate, I like the handling more than, say, the slightly floaty and imprecise old Black Box-era Need for Speed games, but it’s a little less honed than the likes of a responsive arcade driving game like Driver: San Francisco. Importantly, I found the default driving settings, with a host of driving aids activated, far too muted. I’d recommend experimenting with the sport and hardcore presets. Less appealing is the vapid story that’s supposed to be coaxing us through The Crew’s 30- to 40-hour main salvo of missions. Ubisoft has shirked the slightly quirky approach that worked so well for Driver: San Francisco and opted for a far more po-faced plot plucked from the same pile of napkins EA uses to scrawl down story beats for Need for Speed. So we’re down-on-his-luck street racer and Gordon Freeman cosplayer Alex Taylor, framed for murdering his own brother, working with the FBI and a crew of other ne'er-do-wells to clear his name. To do so he needs to infiltrate a nationwide racing gang with the most contrived internal ranking system this side of a criminal empire conceived by Hot Wheels. It’s asinine stuff, even for a video game. There’s a fairly narrow selection of main mission types dangling from this hokey narrative thread, and they’re all generally riffs on a few core concepts. You’re mostly either partaking in some standard racing (to be honest, these are generally the best events), escaping from the cops, or chasing down an “enemy vehicle” to shunt off the road. Later on The Crew adds off-road barrel smashing runs (that seem inspired by a similar mission type in Driver: San Francisco) and occasionally mixes things up with fun multi-class races that put you in a slower car that’s nonetheless able to take shortcuts your opponents can’t. The mission set gets repetitive but the locations are pleasantly ever-changing: one moment you might be negotiating the grid layout of Manhattan, and an hour or so later you’ll be tearing up a dirt track as you weave through a Louisiana bayou.  Sticking to the campaign isn’t as lucrative as I’d anticipated, however, and at the end of it all I found myself at the level cap, out of story missions and without enough cash to buy any of the most-desirable cars (of which there aren’t as many as I’d anticipated there would be; far less than even the likes of the original TDU, The Crew’s spiritual ancestor). You’ll need to put in a good deal of work to build the funds you’ll need to afford the game’s hypercars (without stooping to investing real money in The Crew’s wholly unnecessary microtransaction system). Happily there’s still plenty to do following the conclusion of the main thread and once you hit level 50 you unlock the ability to secure ‘platinum’ car parts (as opposed to gold ones) that come with a random car stat boost. It’s at this point The Crew truly settles into its RPG groove as you’re encouraged to grind challenges until you score the best possible drop of car loot for your ride. You’ll need these platinum parts to make any sort of meaningful dent in The Crew’s PvP lobbies. There’s another layer of very lengthy events outside the main story thread (at least one of which warns us it will take four hours to complete) but I found the PvP races are actually a far better source of cash. The online racing is robust and, although it’s biased towards whoever brings the fastest car (unlike the single-player, for better or for worse), it’s very generous with cash prizes. Whether you’re winning or not (and I generally wasn’t) I always felt incentivised to keep plugging away. The PVP racing itself, which you can compete in either individually or with teammates, was dependable during testing but at its most enjoyable with collisions turned off. I particularly like how the enormous nature of the world means discrete tracks appear to available in spades, although it could probably do with some kind of voting system for event types to make things more democratic (rather than leaving it solely to the racer in first place). I’ve enjoyed the PvP but I don’t know that I’m engaged enough to keep coming back to it. The Crew deserves credit for the frankly staggering size of its open world, and the fact that it’s absolutely filled to the brim with racing, challenges, a fat multiplayer offering, and exploration potential. This scope, however, has resulted in some noticeable visual concessions, the racing itself is too often hamstrung by AI prone to unfair bursts of speed that do nothing but frustrate, and I was surprised at how unwilling the community currently seems to join co-op missions and just how difficult the game’s often miserly winnings makes collecting the cars.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/game-of-thrones-episode-1-iron-from-ice-review	 The world of Game of Thrones is a bleak place where life is never fair, and doing the right thing more often than not results in terrible consequences for honorable people. The first episode of Telltale’s six-part Game of Thrones game represents that cruel reality explicitly; in two hours of dialogue decisions made with the knowledge that being good and noble might mean the downfall of House Forrester and the original characters you control, it sets up great anticipation for future episodes and delivers a strong ending of its own.  First, a warning: definitely do not approach this game as a way to introduce yourself to Game of Thrones. It’s made for existing fans, in that it requires a good amount of knowledge of the story, and it begins with a massive spoiler for anyone who hasn’t seen the first three seasons or read through the third A Song of Ice and Fire book, A Storm of Swords. For that matter, you’re best off skipping this review until you’ve gotten that far in, since the entire story revolves around fallout from those events. The game mimics the structure of the show (and the books) by jumping between the perspectives of three characters: Garred Tuttle, squire to Lord Forrester; Ethan Forrester, who must step up to rule the Forrester seat of Ironrath in his father’s absence; and Mira Forrester, Ethan’s older sister and handmaiden to Margaery Tyrell in King’s Landing. Each of them has their own distinct role to play in attempting to salvage House Forrester’s future, and each maintains the pace with a few difficult decisions to make. Garred’s scenes involve a lot of simple, straightforward quick-time event-style action. It’s not challenging, but it breaks up the dialogue with brutal bloodshed, and it sets a tone that raises the stakes of the diplomacy that follows. His decisions of whether to try to save everyone or sacrifice them for the greater good are tense, thanks to the ticking clock that adds urgency to almost every dialogue choice, but typical. His bigger quest is to deliver a secret only to certain ears, which is a bit silly because you’re never given a reason to want to divulge it. You have to deliberately choose to fail. (And yes, I went back and replayed just to see what would happen if I haphazardly blurted it out at every opportunity.) Scenes from Ethan’s perspective are some of the strongest. His heated negotiations with the lord of a rival house, while receiving guidance from his advisors, are especially well written and acted. Later, the decision of which of his advisors to elevate above the others also carries weight - not because it has any major impact on this episode, but for the implications for the future aggressive or diplomatic stance of the house. And we get the opportunity to establish our version of Ethan as a harsh or lenient lord. Mira’s scenes in the capital city of King’s Landing are a good change of setting from the grays and browns of Ironrath, and playing her small part in the power struggle between Margaery and Cersei adds another layer of intrigue to the plot. Choosing just how much to ask of Margaery and how far to bend to appease Cersei – and whether to trust offers of help – are some of the most interesting from the big-picture perspective. Across the board, acting is up to the high standards Telltale has set with its past games. Plus, all the characters from the show who appear - Margaery Tyrell, Queen Cersei and Tyrion Lannister, and Ramsay Snow – are authentically voiced by their TV actors, and the likenesses are good enough that details like Cersei’s signature lopsided sneer and slightly raised eyebrow come through. Those portrayals are undermined slightly by occasionally glitchy animations, with characters or limbs sometimes warping into place or briefly vanishing. And while the painterly art style generally looks quite good, the brushstroke effect on backgrounds can be distracting when the camera moves and causes the strokes to shimmer around. It’s important to note that most choices in Episode 1 have little or no significant impact within this two-hour section of the story. In fairness, it’s an episode that positions itself as a prologue, concluding with “Your story begins,” so much of what makes this a great start for the series is the promises it makes – or implies – for what’s to come. It caps off with a powerful and shocking ending that reminds us both of the kind of harsh world we’re in, and also that the major events of this story are going to be beyond our control. Tough decisions, well-acted original characters in interesting situations, and a strong, provocative ending kick off Telltale’s new Game of Thrones series in a great way. Its nature as a side-story to the HBO show means we won’t get to decide the fate of Westeros, but this introduction is convincing evidence that the future of House Forrester puts enough at stake to make choices matter.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/wwe-2k15-review-ps4xbox-one	" When Rocky Maivia made his WWE debut in 1996, he had the look and the talent, but he hadn't yet developed the star power that would make “The Rock” famous. WWE 2K15's debut on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One has a similar mix: it looks and feels top-notch, but doesn't have the feature depth the series has previously delivered, making it feel like a step backward in a lot of important ways. WWE 2K15's most notable improvements are apparent from the first bell. The frenetic pace that’s characterized WWE on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 has been slowed considerably, and it's mostly for the best. Take the start-of-match chain-wrestling sequences. These exchanges won't decide the direction of the contest, but they can start the superior technician off with slightly more momentum. While it’s an option that can be turned off, the sequences are enjoyable and tactical enough that I never wanted to.  As the bouts progress, the slower combat is both a blessing and a curse. Punches and kicks feel like they hit harder, thanks to precise collision detection. More importantly, the slower speed makes strikes easier-to-counter, allowing you to effectively shut down annoying strike-spammers. The realistic stamina system isn't quite as beneficial. As matches hit their endgame, things slow down far too much. Weakened competitors will slowly rise from attacks, crawl to the ropes, and stagger across the ring, which can make the final moments of a match either exhilarating or exasperating. While I enjoyed feats like making a desperate push to tag in a fresh partner or slowly draping an arm to make a pin on an equally depleted opponent, there were many more instances where I ran out of gas far too early and became more of a bystander than competitor. The new-gen exclusive MyCareer mode is that same sense of purgatory writ large. I spent well over 10 hours bringing my created superstar from NXT tryouts to WWE Pay-Per-View matches, and ultimately, to championship gold. Along the way, however, not much else really happened. I ran afoul of some factions, had a few one-on-one feuds, and occasionally had to endure difficult tests from authority figures, but I also had to endure an excruciating amount of filler. In between these major events, the vast majority of MyCareer is spent taking part in storyline-free tune-up bouts and dark matches. I would have gladly traded these fights and their utility in improving my character's stats for something a third as long that only included the unique story stuff. Fortunately, The 2K Showcase mode won't waste nearly as much of your time. It’s a mostly comprehensive look at two major feuds: the Triple H-Shawn Michaels rivalry that ran from 2002 to 2004, and the CM Punk-John Cena feud that kicked off the modern ""Reality Era"" in 2011. There's a handful of no-contest finishes and meaningless Smackdown main events that probably didn't need to be included though, and the complete lack of WrestleMania bouts like Punk vs Undertaker or Triple H vs Booker T is sad. Still, Showcase lands a little closer to the ""every match matters"" feel of last year's 30 Years of WrestleMania than the slew of forgettable recreations found in WWE '13's Attitude Era mode.  Old-school talent like Macho Man and Andre the Giant are under-represented, while even some modern stars from last year were also cut, like Zack Rider and Sin Cara. Most of those who made it in benefit from 2K's new-gen overhaul, and many, like Cesaro, Randy Orton, and Dean Ambrose look stunningly accurate. Those who haven't had new-gen attention stick out like sore thumbs, though. Stars like The Rock and CM Punk are only slightly improved (due to the real stars being unavailable for likeness capturing) and some Divas actually look less realistic than their last-gen counterparts. In better news, the creepy glitches that permeated WWE games on the 360 and PS3 have been drastically reduced, but you can still expect some instances of weapons flying out of the ring at mach speed or weirdly twisting limbs defying physiology. Improvements have been made in the audio department as well. It's quite obvious that Jerry Lawler and Michael Cole recorded a lot of new commentary, and together to boot. In particular, the beginning of Showcase matches feature good back-and-forth chemistry, which was lacking in the past. There's also a good amount of new trivia added for every star, though a bit too much of it is Cole listing a wrestler's title wins or Lawler reading off moves. Be warned; a fair amount of dialogue from previous WWE installments is repeated, so you'll hear ""he's putting his educated feet to good use"" a few hundred times more this year.  Even more distressing than the shrunken roster are the creation options and match types that have been dropped between generations. Customized title belts and arenas are gone, which is a bummer, but there are two far bigger omissions: you can't create original stories, nor can you make an original female wrestler. The WWE Universe mode does have expanded story options that you can assign to rivalries, but they're rarely personalized to specific wrestlers, making them a poor alternative to community creations. Match types have also seen drastic reductions. Some gimmicky stuff like Inferno or I Quit matches won't be missed, but the loss of standard elimination matches and four-man Hell in a Cell hurts. While both consoles can put a half-dozen wrestlers on screen (a slight disappointment since that was the same cap on last-gen) the biggest differences between new-gen consoles is that the Xbox One version allows six human players while PlayStation 4 only allows four.  Beyond that, there are no performances differences, as both bring their best 1080p and 60 fps behavior to fights. WWE 2K15 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One doesn't quite meet the expectations set by previous entries in the series. While the wrestlers look amazing and the combat feels significantly better, MyCareer mode is an absolute slog and everything else has been done better in previous years. Between the narrower historical mode, the shuttered creation suites, and the dearth of combat options for bigger groups, WWE 2K15 has lost some of the tools that brought previous entries to the main event."
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/gta-5-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-review	 When we reviewed Grand Theft Auto 5 on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on September 16, 2013, it earned a score of 10 out of 10 - a masterpiece. Here’s what we said then: Grand Theft Auto V is not only a preposterously enjoyable video game, but also an intelligent and sharp-tongued satire of contemporary America. It represents a refinement of everything that GTA IV brought to the table five years ago. It’s technically more accomplished in every conceivable way, but it’s also tremendously ambitious in its own right. No other world in video games comes close to this in size or scope, and there is sharp intelligence behind its sense of humour and gift for mayhem. It tells a compelling, unpredictable, and provocative story without ever letting it get in the way of your own self-directed adventures through San Andreas. It is one of the very best video games ever made.   Watch our full original video review. Virtually everything in that review stands true of the 2014 version on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. This is the same 30-plus hours of action-heavy story missions with the same three satirical protagonists, and nearly limitless potential for driving, flying, boating, or biking around. Just a smattering of minor new side quests, different types of wildlife (from cats to dolphins), and collectibles top off its already enormous pile of content. The key difference between GTA 5 on new-gen consoles and last year's version is that developer Rockstar has done an outstanding job of updating this still-amazing game so that it feels right at home on these platforms. Everything looks strikingly better running at full 1080p resolution, with dramatically enhanced textures, lighting effects, and detail in general. A greatly increased draw distance makes the vistas of the San Andreas region extremely impressive, and I don’t know if I’ve ever seen an in-game rainstorm as convincing as these. With this revamp, GTA 5 has reestablished itself as the high bar for what an open-world game can be in terms of scale, graphical quality, and density of things to do.  While the PlayStation 4 version has a slight graphical edge over the Xbox One, featuring noticeably more grass and plants in some areas, both generally do a good job of maintaining 30 frames per second, with only occasional minor slowdowns that mostly kick in when approaching busy intersections at high speed. Other than that, the only appreciable differences I spotted were that the Xbox One’s rumble triggers give driving a more tactile feel, and the DualShock 4 plays cell phone conversations and beeps through the controller’s speakers, and the light on the controller flashes red and blue when the police are after you. The big new feature for the new-generation consoles is the optional first-person mode. It’s a whole new way of experiencing Grand Theft Auto like we never have before. Rockstar has gone out of its way to make sure everything looks great when viewing it through your characters’ eyes instead of over their shoulders, and the controls work pretty much the way you expect them to in a first-person shooter. An impressive amount of control configuration options let you tailor it to your liking, and you can even set it to automatically switch from first to third person when you enter cover or get into a car. The different perspective made things feel more like they were happening to me, rather than a character I was controlling, which makes GTA a surprisingly different experience. Driving or flying is, of course, a lot tougher with the more limited view, but still lots of fun, and the ability to switch at will makes it a luxury.  It’s impressive how virtually no opportunity to throw in a subtle little touch was missed. There are now first-person-specific animations for all kinds of activities, including climbing ladders, getting yanked out of a car you’ve just stolen and thrown to the ground, and flipping the bird. Even in-mission events, like when Michael’s son hands him a soda in the car, are animated – Michael’s hand reaches out, takes the drink, and brings it up to the camera as he takes a sip.  GTA 5 for new-gen consoles also includes the still-problematic Grand Theft Auto Online multiplayer mode. It’s absolutely great for small-scale multiplayer antics, where you and a few friends get together and do co-op jobs, races, death matches, vehicular combat battles, or just sew random chaos throughout the San Andreas region. However, in a week of trying, I’ve never been able to get into a game with more than seven players – far short of the advertised increased limit of 30. Worse, the wait times to get in and out of matches has been extreme, to the point where my GTA Online experience has been roughly 60 percent playing and 40 percent waiting to play, with frequent disconnects and occasional crashes. Because of that, I can’t strongly recommend getting GTA 5 based on the multiplayer experience alone. Grand Theft Auto 5 on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 is a masterwork for all the same reasons mentioned in our original Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 review. Its world is a truly astonishing achievement in so many ways, and these two versions are currently the best way to experience it, aside from the hobbled multiplayer matchmaking. If you missed GTA 5 before, it’s absolutely a game that has to be played. Whether it’s worth buying a second time is entirely dependent on whether you’re interested in replaying the same game again – and only you can answer that. But I’m glad to have had a reason to revisit it, and am happy to find it even more impressive than it was before.
Chris Schilling	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	 There was one moment during my time with it that I knew that old PES sparkle was back, and it wasn’t a sumptuous strike or a slick piece of build-up play. It wasn’t a spectacular save, nor a thrilling goalmouth scramble. It was a near miss. Picture the scene: it’s a pulsating Serie A encounter between Juventus and Roma, played under floodlights on a dark, wintry evening. The game is enticingly poised at one apiece. Arturo Vidal jabs his boot forward to regain possession just inside his own half, and plays a simple square ball to Andrea Pirlo. He chips it forward: it’s a classic Pirlo wedge shot, aimed towards rangy frontman Fernando Llorente. It's Pirlo, so the ball's almost perfect; Llorente backs up, glancing at his marker, who unexpectedly climbs early and just about gets his head to it first. Carlos Tevez anticipates the loose ball, automatically backing up slightly to receive it as it drops. He’s around 35 yards out, and I glance at the radar to see the opposition goalkeeper a little way off his line. Tevez chests it down, and it sits up beautifully on the bounce.  I can’t possibly resist, and squeeze the square button, releasing just before the gauge reaches full power. The ball’s trajectory takes it quite high, but Tevez has hit it with topspin. The 'keeper, clearly not expecting a shot from range, backpedals desperately towards his goal as it comes down. He stretches out his fingertips, even though he knows he's not getting close to the ball. Yet he's in luck: it drops just over the crossbar, grazing it on the way, before rolls over the top of the net. The fans hold their heads in their hands and I follow suit. I can’t remember the last time I enjoyed not scoring in a football game quite so much as this. PES 2015 can still be a little rigid in places, but I've not experienced anything close to that moment with EA Sports’ equivalent, FIFA 15. This year, ‘the pitch is ours’ is developer Konami’s mantra. This year, the pitch is accurate. Firstly, let’s highlight the area in which PES compares most favourably to its biggest rival. It’s no exaggeration to say that the artificial intelligence here is some of the finest I’ve encountered in any sports simulation. The fact that it will go unnoticed by some is perhaps the biggest compliment you can pay it; it’s perhaps more starkly noticeable to me because of its apparent absence in FIFA. Here, wing-backs offer themselves on the overlap; midfielders drop back when possession is lost; defenders step out to play strikers offside; keepers sprint from their boxes to clear lofted through balls just before the opposition centre forward can lash it goalward. Mistakes happen, but they’re rare, and more commonly attributed to your own errors. It’s important because it means that any time you lose the ball, any time you concede a goal, it’s hard to blame anyone but yourself. You won’t just see that intelligence in your own teammates, either. If a full-back gets a yellow card, you can bet a smart opponent will try to exploit that booking, focusing their sorties down that side of the pitch. If you’ve got a slow centre-back pairing, then you’ll see plenty of attempts to play pacy strikers in behind you, either via slide-rule through-balls or high passes aimed into space. You’ll need to identify not just your opponent’s strengths and weaknesses, but your own, plugging gaps, and modifying your attacking style. There’s no one sure-fire way to win, and while there are a few sweet spots (a corner hit with just above medium power into that corridor of uncertainty between ‘keeper and defence was quite a reliable source of goals for me) you’ll rarely be able to rely on the same tactic twice. Opponents do seem to adapt, too: after scoring from two swift, direct counter-attacks as Real Madrid, Liverpool managed to cut off Cristiano Ronaldo’s supply line, and it took a scrappy last-minute deflected strike before he earned the match ball. Pace and stamina matter, too. You’ll be able to rely on feints and trickery on occasion, but changes in direction and sudden bursts of speed are more likely to get you past your man. Sprinting at full tilt will usually get you tackled, but with wingers like Navas and Stirling, holding the ball before suddenly accelerating is the way to get you that extra yard of space to fizz in a cross. Your strikers will anticipate this, waving their arms as they pull away from their markers and move into the box ready to receive the ball. Runs are best used judiciously, too, as they’re the only way you’ll conserve enough stamina to stay efficient for the full 90 minutes. Opponents tire too, of course, so it’s not particularly noticeable until the later stages. Bring on fresh legs – particularly when you pit a nippy forward against a labouring defender - and you’ll be able to see the difference. It’s rewarding to see substitutions having such a tangible impact. As a result of all this, not to mention the ability to more effectively control the pace of the game by putting your foot on the ball, PES is simultaneously predictable and unpredictable. It’s predictable in the very best sense of the word: in that you learn to read certain strategies over time, to grow accustomed to a team’s idiosyncrasies, to react to changes in personnel and tactics – even to instinctively know where the ball will end up when you release a pass or let fly with a shot. And it’s unpredictable in the right way, too: in that you can never rest on your laurels, in that the game unfolds organically, and there’s no single sure-fire route to success.  Elsewhere, PES’s much-touted myClub feels like a direct challenge to EA Sports. It’s an online-focused mode that invites you to build a squad from a team of no-hopers to genuine contenders, and if it takes plenty of cues from Ultimate Team, it makes for a solid, familiar structure. There’s a fine art to assembling a squad with a positive team spirit: you’ll need to recruit both the right manager and the sort of players who are a good tactical fit for their chosen style of play. Only then will you see the pitch’s heat map redden, denoting a stronger chemistry; it’s a slightly clumsier way of doing things than its rival, which makes everything a little more transparent, but the nuts and bolts of it work just fine. There’s an interesting wrinkle, too, in the form of agents: the more you gain from completed matches - thus encouraging you not to quit before the full-time whistle blows - the more you’ll increase the likelihood of you signing your dream player. You can make things easier for yourself with day-one bonuses, while the rush of points you’ll earn from completing objectives for the first time – from chipped passes to rainbow flicks to goals – may be enough to unlock galacticos. I managed to nab both Andres Iniesta and Gareth Bale before my third match, both selected from what essentially amounts to a wheel of fortune. In other words, you’re once again beholden to the whims of the RNG, but at least everyone’s in the same boat. You can grease the wheels by paying real money for PES’s other currency, myClub coins, though this feature wasn’t available at the time of writing. With bonuses for daily play and regular top-ups for in-game achievements, these seem a less egregious form of microtransaction than most, even if the mode itself is essentially Ultimate Team under a different name. Yet it lacks the polish and immediacy of its big-money counterpart, spoiled by a lacklustre user interface and a few baffling design choices. The process of adding new players into your squad is particularly confusing, the feeble tutorial forgetting to tell you that you need to release or deregister a current player first. Still, it’s had more attention paid to it than the rather bare-bones Master League option, a series mainstay that looks increasingly creaky in light of the competition. The real acid test, however, comes with online play. It’s an area in which Konami has historically struggled, but I’m cautiously optimistic that the publisher has finally got things right. It’s early days yet, and perhaps this will change when the servers fill up, but I rarely had to wait long to find a game, and lag was either light or absent when I did. I’ve always felt PES was at its best as a couch-based multiplayer game, but it’s heartening to see such a robust online component. It’s certainly more than enough to compensate for those remaining few off-pitch flaws, and for the continued shortfall when it comes to licensed content. Konami, seemingly aware it can no longer compete in that regard – even with a wealth of official international tournaments – has instead decided to play to its strengths. If it’s impossible to dismiss the allure of authentic chants, stadia, team names, and kits, it’s telling that PES 2015 is intrinsically rewarding enough not to require those hooks. Strip away the fripperies and there’s a clear winner – and this year, for once, it isn’t EA Sports. After an extensive rebuilding process, PES 2015 is a series back to its best. It embraces its PS2-era roots while offering almost everything you could want from a modern football simulation. The marketing blurb isn’t just braggadocio on Konami’s part; the pitch really is theirs.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	 The Himalayan country of Kyrat is a place of myth, faith, secrets, lies, and beauty, and it's one of the best-realized locations I've ever explored in a video game. Kyrat is a colossal, dense, visually diverse place that feels lived in, torn up, and ancient. Far Cry 4 capitalizes on every available strength to make it an amazing open world for first-person action and adventure, while failing repeatedly in creating enjoyable characters within it. Its most notable misfire is the hollow, ambivalent protagonist. Ajay Ghale, the American son of Kyrati freedom fighters, returns to his Himalayan birthplace to scatter his mother’s ashes, and becomes embroiled in his parents’ revolution. It’s a smart, human premise that justifies Ajay’s rampant warpath throughout Kyrat, but Ajay isn’t remotely as interesting as the things he does.  Versatility is the greatest strength in Far Cry 4’s first-person exploration and combat. I scaled cliffs with climbing gear in search of treasure, religious monuments, and hostages in need of rescue. In venturing into the Himalayan mountains, I stole oxygen masks and snowmobiles to survive, and used the unstable environment to crush enemies with snow. Long-lost letters told a tragic story I wanted to learn more about. Collectible calling cards had me on the trail of a serial killer, and gorgeous vistas had me in awe of Kyrat’s lakes, mountains, and other spectacular scenery. This is sometimes compromised by lower-resolution textures and an inferior draw distance on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, but Far Cry 4 is comparable to Far Cry 3 in terms of visual fidelity, and up to expectations for old-generation hardware. I loved discovering every inch of Kyrat because it always presented compelling opportunities. Liberating it from the oppressive government was always front and center; as in Far Cry 3, enemy-occupied towers serve as platforming puzzles with a fulfilling sense of personal progression. Climbing to the top gives you a broader perspective of the world, highlighting notable places and unlocking new objectives. Liberating outposts is more challenging in Far Cry 4 than in its predecessor, and more satisfying as a result. Take the stealthy approach and you can disable alarms individually to prevent enemy reinforcements, and use bait to attract tigers, bears, and other animals to occupy the enemy’s attention. The hard counter to this is the Hunter, a new, silent enemy wielding a bow and capable of charming animals into fighting for him. He creates another unexpected variable that made me think even harder about how these excellent combat systems worked together. Plus, enemy forces sometimes attempt to reclaim their territory, challenging you to drop what you're doing and fend off waves of ruthless soldiers. This also  encourages you to take down specific strongholds that, when vanquished, cease the takeovers. Wrestling with the Royal Army like this puts an even stronger emphasis on outposts, one of the franchise's most alluring attractions.  These encounters emphasize the importance of improvisation in Far Cry 4. The unpredictability of a situation getting out of hand often leads to catastrophic, unforgettable moments — like the time I blew up a bear with C4 to protect the hired guns I'd called in to help take an outpost. Once, I shot grenades from my personal helicopter and watched the fire trap the enemies below. Another time, I mounted an elephant, smashed through a gate, and flipped a pickup truck into a man. Tossing enemies with my elephant’s one-hit-kill trunk is basically everything I dreamed it would be. Outpost battles — particularly the four larger fortresses owned by government officers — are at their best when a friend drops in for some two-player co-op. Adding another player to the volatility of Far Cry combat leads to new kinds of hectic, hilarious moments. Cooperative multiplayer also introduces new tactical opportunities, like having one player blow through the front door while another sneaks in through the back to stab distracted guards. You can, if you're patient and skilled, use Far Cry 4's Map Editor to create your own single-player outpost missions. At launch, most of the best missions are familiar takeover objectives, with a nice variety of snowy settings, evening assaults, and intricate, larger level designs. I don't see myself making much, but I'll absolutely jump into a community map between co-op outpost runs. Far Cry 4’s competitive multiplayer does a marvelous job of capturing the freedom, scale, and surprises of its co-op and campaign. The 5v5 competitive multiplayer, called Far Cry Chronicles, sees two asymmetrical factions fighting in different ways, using the wide-open environments to their particular advantages. The Golden Path plays more like an aggressive Far Cry player tends to -- guns, explosives, vehicles, and traps. The Rakshasa, who borrow supernatural powers seen in Shangri-La, relying on invisibility, and different types of arrows for their bow. I adore the Rakshasa style -- teleporting with the Blink Arrow, whether for navigation, escape, or an instant kill, is a great tool. Summoning a tiger or bear to guard an area works beautifully. Chronicles also has a strong economy, with in-game successes earning coins to spend on new weapons, attachments, or skills, such as stronger stealth, faster movement, or a closer connection to wildlife summons. The maps aren’t terribly notable in Chronicles, and the modes are simple, unremarkable, but functional, but borders on miraculous that the heart and soul of Far Cry 4 found its way into a competitive mode at all. It’s a bummer that matches start whether or not teams are even, and that not a lot of people are actually playing it, because this is actually great. Don't skip multiplayer because it isn't why you play a Far Cry game. The supernatural side-story set in Shangri-La stands out above nearly every other objective, online feature, and other Far Cry 4 success, though. Like a miniature Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon doled out in chunks throughout Far Cry 4, the psychedelic, stunning aesthetic of its crimson foliage and golden skies is completely unlike Kyrat, as is the foundation of its combat. It’s linear, by design, but introduces enough new and interesting ideas to have an identity of its own. Teaming up with a fierce tiger, slowing time, and firing five arrows at a time to take down fearsome demons is a huge change of pace. The myth is explained episodically, and while I didn’t fully understand the legend, I couldn’t seek out the next piece of Shangri-La’s weird, wonderful world fast enough.  All of these missions feed into Far Cry 4’s brilliant economy, where everything in Kyrat has a cause and effect. Hunting and skinning animals lets you craft holsters to hold more weapons, or wallets to carry more money. Reclaiming enemy territory creates fast-travel points and opens side-quests promising huge cash payouts. Destroying propaganda posters unlocks new missions as well as earns experience points. XP unlocks new skills, like aerial takedowns, damage resistance, and riding elephants, which is both hysterical and actually useful. It also presents opportunities to become a better hunter — unlockable injections show off animal and enemy locations, or double the damage you deal and take. Far Cry 4 borrows heavily from Far Cry 3’s superb player progression (many of the skills are direct carryovers), and then layers new rewards on top of it. New Karma Events unlock gear, discounts, and XP for spinning spiritual prayer wheels, or killing specific enemies in randomly occurring objectives. Half the campaign’s main missions are strong, memorable, and take advantage of Far Cry 4’s flexible combat. These quests typically explore Ajay Ghale’s fascinating family history, or the ethically gray future of the Ghale’s faction, The Golden Path, and the dark places your choices can take it. The Golden Path’s bickering leaders, Amita and Sabal, are the emotional anchor for this part of the story. They’re unified in their goal to dethrone the despicable king of Kyrat, Pagan Min, but their conflicting personal philosophies cause volatile problems for the country. I was often conflicted about who to side with during single-player missions – both make strong ethical arguments for why you should, say, claim an enemy opium farm to fund your revolution, or destroy it to free Kyrat from narcotics. Where the Golden Path goes, and which missions become available, differ depending on who you choose to lead the revolution. When Amita and Sabal aren’t involved, Far Cry 4’s cast of mostly poor characters compromises its campaign.  The weaker half of the story relates to Pagan Min and his lieutenants. I barely remember what the missions were, or what completing them accomplished. Pagan Min is a great character, thanks to an excellent, gleefully sadistic and twisted performance from actor Troy Baker. But Min is completely misused. He has a thunderous introduction, followed by a disappointing, minimal presence throughout Far Cry 4’s 15-hour campaign. Worse, his poorly explained henchmen don’t have time to become interesting before vanishing from the story in sudden and confusing ways. When I’d finished with a story I simultaneously loved and loathed, I keep returning to my meandering around Kyrat. I uncovered new temples. I found more of Ajay’s father’s journals, chronicling the struggles of The Golden Path’s rise. I wondered whether I’d made the right choices for Kyrat -- a country I didn’t want to leave, and a place I’ll continue fighting for as long as it keeps giving me reasons to. Diversity is one of Far Cry 4’s strongest assets, and it overwhelms the mostly disappointing story with countless opportunities for free-form adventure and fun. Visual variety, tons of distinct side-quests, and a dense world with plenty of options always gave me something I wanted to do, and its satisfying economy had me obsessing over completing every side-quest. It’s a little safe, overall -- its competitive multiplayer stands out as a gamble that paid off -- in that it has many familiar elements from Far Cry 3 transplanted to an amazing new place, but those elements are incredibly empowering and rewarding.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	 Assassin’s Creed Unity is a game of impossible peaks and disappointing valleys. Its highs of movement, customization options, and just the city of Paris itself pierce the sky like the spire of Notre Dame. On a purely technical level, Unity is a marvel to walk through and admire. But at the same time, a lot of my journey through the French Revolution felt as cold and heartless as the darkest depths of the catacombs. I was never given a real reason to care about new Assassin Arno, or the events that transpired. Instead, I had to find my own fun throughout my 30 hours in Unity, which was generally easy to do in its large sandbox assassination scenarios. However, it’s a bit disappointing to see how few of the long-standing problems with the series have been solved by the upgrade to the new generation of gaming hardware. The new consoles’ graphical power is put to good use in Ubisoft’s recreation of 18th-century Paris, which is absolutely stunning. As we’ve come to expect from an Assassin’s Creed game, it’s sprawling, gorgeous, and absolutely packed with sights to see and things to do. Climbing to the top of Notre Dame, synchronizing with one of the series’ iconic viewpoints, and watching the camera pull back and show you the breadth of your universe is staggering.   Each of the various districts unfolds with its own sense of character and environmental storytelling, from the ornate palaces of the privileged, to back-alleys running with the blood of the revolutionaries. But what makes it really unique and distinct from past games is its citizens, who form some of the largest, most impressive crowds I've ever encountered. In particular, a late-game mission involving Louis XVI was populated with several thousand characters, and wading through the crowd was one of the most memorable moments of the campaign. Despite being technologically impressive and adding a lot to the atmosphere of Paris as a living and thriving city, I found myself oftentimes swearing at the digital hoards that populated the streets when I simply wanted to make my way from one place to another. As the story progressed, I found that the masses of Parisians mostly got in the way, and spotting repeating character models was a crude reminder I was playing a video game. The disgruntled masses make it even more of a necessity to scurry along rooftops instead of the streets, and thankfully, this mode of transportation does not disappoint. Most of the time, traversal in Unity feels better than ever thanks to fantastic animations, buildings with plenty of climbable paths, and a new downward parkour system that adds certain finesse to the act of shimming down a wall, resolving one of my big gripes with previous AC games. (Unless there was a haystack handy, I usually just lept off and hoped that I had enough health to survive.)   When it all worked perfectly, guiding my Arno up, down, and across the Parisian skyline brought me a great sense of satisfaction. The key phrase there was “when it all worked,” because the series-long frustration of your assassin not doing quite what you want him to do is still present here. I found myself quickly losing momentum and clumsily hopping about whenever I tried to enter a window and explore any of Unity’s huge array of interior spaces. It was also particularly frustrating in stealth sections, which Unity emphasizes heavily. Navigating between pieces of cover is finicky, and it was never clear whether or not I was even hidden. Getting back on the story track, I found that Unity’s main Assassins-versus-Templars plot is relatively forgettable, and has none of the fun and levity of last year’s Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag. Arno is a one-dimensional character whose motivation is little more than the standard revenge tale. I never really found a reason to care about his Forrest Gump-style quest through the French Revolution, and an unfulfilling ending definitely left a sour taste in my mouth. (What’s more, the fact that everyone in Unity - including Napoleon Bonaparte himself - speaks with an English accent is completely inexplicable and immersion-breaking.)   It didn’t help that Arno doesn’t bring any distinctive new Assassin abilities to the table, making combat the same parry-heavy scenarios as in previous games. Enemies are definitely more aggressive this time around, but I found that cheesing the smoke bomb ability led to cheap victories in even the toughest battles. There’s also a sharp, jarring difficulty spike in the final Sequence, which led to a whole mess of annoying failures until I finally found a crude, unfulfilling way to just get past the mission and put it all behind me. Thankfully, aside from that final Sequence, the missions themselves are generally pretty great. First off, there are almost no annoying tailing missions, which have always been a bane of the series. Instead, Unity is filled with a wide range of interesting activities. Side-quests filled with Parisian myths, legends, and tall-tales pepper the city. Gathering severed heads for Madame Tussaud, uncovering the mysteries of a catacombs-dwelling cult, and befriending the captivatingly weird Marquis de Sade all proved to be great little micro-stories.   Interestingly, Unity has the least amount of outside-the-Animus meta-story of any Assassin’s Creed game – which I’m actually thankful for. The few moments where you do leave 18th-century Paris unfold as surprising set-pieces that I wouldn’t want to spoil for you, but were each extremely entertaining. These sections definitely rely heavily on scripted events, but each one proved to be an exciting break from the main story. The best missions in Unity, though, are the sandbox assassinations that usually conclude each Sequence, and which consistently left me thrilled. Each one is a puzzle with a ton of different solutions. For instance, your target is inside a heavily fortified cathedral. Do you want to steal a key and creep in through a side door, climb up to the top of the church and shimmy in through an open window, slink through the catacombs and come up from underneath, or simply throw caution into the wind and go in swords-a-blazing?   All of these are possible, and experimentation is encouraged thanks to Creed Points (their term, not mine) that reward interesting decisions with currency that can be spent to upgrade your weapons and armor. This new depth of character customization is one of Unity’s best contributions to the series. Money and Creed Points are relatively scarce, and I always found myself agonizing over which weapon to purchase, which pieces of armor to upgrade, and which skills to unlock. The decision between lock picking or poison bombs, or between armor that improves combat or stealth, would change the way I approached encounters throughout the campaign in meaningful ways. While Arno’s 15-hour story arc is one that can only be experienced alone, there are a ton of side missions in Unity that encourage, require, and reward drop-in cooperative gameplay. Two-player Heists demand constant communication, with a single misstep usually resulting in a chaotic mess of steel, bullets, and failure. Playing with a buddy was always entertaining, despite the fact that most missions boiled down to us trying to be stealthy, getting spotted, and then proceeding to just murder every living thing within the city limits. Practice might eventually make perfect.  Once four players team up for a mission, a terrific blend of competitive cooperation forms. If one person dies, the entire team loses, so it’s in your best interest to keep your friends alive. At the same time, your rewards at the end of the mission are dependent on how well you played individually, creating situations where you aren’t sure whether you should hop in and help a buddy in need, or remain hidden and grow your own potential reward. I really appreciate that single-player and multiplayer all feeds into the same central economy. No matter what I was doing in Unity, I was always progressing my character a bit forward down the path of becoming a master assassin.   PlayStation 4 Version Out of the box, the PS4 version of Unity has some significant framerate issues, but after the 900MB day-one patch and the PS4 2.02 firmware, it ran pretty much on par with its Xbox One counterpart. Apart from some minor hiccups in large crowds and certain Synchronization points, there weren’t any annoying performance issues. Load times and multiplayer matchmaking also ran the same across both platforms. [Update: While Marty didn't encounter significant frame rate problems playing yesterday, last night other IGN staff saw troublesome slowdowns on the PS4 version of Assassin's Creed Unity. Others report similar issues with the Xbox One version. The experience shown in the video below isn't happening to everybody, but it's concerning.]     PC Version As we’ve previously reported, the PC version of Unity requires a pretty hefty rig to run, and an even heftier one is recommended. That said, those of you who have access to this will find that Unity on PC looks even better than its console brethren thanks to being able to run at resolutions above 900p, enhanced textures, and (hardware permitting) a much higher frame rate than the locked 30fps of the Xbox One and PS4.   I put time into Unity on an IGN PC with a Core i7-4670 CPU, a GeForce GTX 780, and 8GB RAM. With all of the graphical settings maxed at Ultra presets and 1920x1080 resolution, it ran at about 30fps, sometimes dipping into the 20s in the midst of major crowds. With a few minor tweaks, such as reducing shadow quality and bloom lighting, we got it running in the ballpark of 40 to 50, save for in-engine cutscenes which tended to dip back down into the 30s. Assassin’s Creed Unity leverages the new-generation consoles to add spectacular new sights and successful co-op multiplayer, but in doing so, it’s created some substantial new problems instead of solving the series’ most persistent ones. The scope is stunning, the customization is satisfying, and the multiplayer touches upon some really ambitious ideas. But the lack of a strong main character or interesting take on the Assassin’s Creed universe costs it momentum and excitement, and the persistent control problems are still a thorn in its side. The first truly new-gen Assassin’s Creed game is a gorgeous, entertaining, and successful proof of concept for what lies ahead for the series, though it isn’t what I’d call revolutionary.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	 Ninety hours. That’s how long it took me to roll the credits on Dragon Age: Inquisition. Though it’s true that quality can’t be measured purely in terms of quantity, that number is still significant. That’s part of why Inquisition is not only one of the most expansive RPGs I’ve ever played, but one of the few that successfully fills its gorgeous, massive world with meaningful things to do and see. A frustratingly vague plot and typical BioWare bugginess drag it down a bit, but both in combat and out, Inquisition marks a welcome return to the RPG depth that made Dragon Age: Origins and Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic so magnetic.  In Dragon Age: Inquisition, you aren’t just the leader of some merry band of adventurers, but the focal point of a sweeping, large-scale movement to bring reform and order to a land ripped apart by civil war and political strife. Literally, in a way, as interdimensional demon-spewing rifts are tearing holes in the sky across the world. Your organization has tons of tiny moving parts to manage, but major actions, such as scouting new regions and undertaking new story missions, require power - a central resource that’s doled out for doing nearly anything of note across Inquisition’s nine large areas. It’s a brilliant idea that gives purpose to all the side-questing and sightseeing by directly tying it to story progression. Some of Inquisition's regions seemed restrictive, even corridor-like when I initially set foot in them, but they soon opened up into vast sandboxes. No matter how many demon-spawning rifts I closed, or hidden shards I found, I always felt like I was making tiny dents on the tip of an iceberg. That’s not to say it lacks a sense of progression; the way you start as a band of upstart rebels and grow into a highly influential martial and political force is one of Inquisition’s most satisfying traits. It’s just that the sheer volume of content borders on overwhelming. Thankfully, a handy quest map makes it easy to track each region’s content, which allowed me to focus my attention on a set goal… at least until wanderlust inevitably set in. And boy, did it set in often. The diverse landscapes of Ferelden and Orlais strike a smart balance between open spaces and narrow, directed paths. Unclaimed keeps and unexplored ranges on the horizon kept tempting me away from my current story objective, while clearly marked pathways kept me from ever feeling truly lost. In fact, I never once felt like I’d hit a dead end, because you can barely walk in any direction for a minute without stumbling upon something to do – and amazingly, none of it ever feels like filler.  That’s partly because of how good of a job Inquisition does of contextualizing its many pieces. Whether it’s with a well-delivered piece of dialogue or a smartly-written bit of supporting lore, every quest you undertake has an air of being something more important than the simple fetch or kill task it actually is. But better still, it all leads to tangible rewards through a series of well-designed crafting and progression systems that give Inquisition’s huge body of content the spine and structure required to keep me engaged. Completing a cursory task for a farmer may open up new mounts for you and your party to ride, and making the right conversation choices with a seemingly unimportant NPC might lead to empire-wide bonuses. You never know how even your smallest actions might impact your experience, which gives further purpose to all the scouring and scrapping you do out in the field. Not that said scrapping needs much incentive beyond the excitement it provides. Inquisition’s new tactical view lets you pause and give orders at will from an overhead perspective, much like you could in Dragon Age: Origin on PC. It takes a little getting used to, especially when the camera decides to misbehave, but once you come to grips with it, it becomes a powerful tool for coordinating your party. You can hang back and set traps for over-zealous enemies, have your rogue creep along the edge of the battlefield to go for flanking bonuses, orchestrate explosive ability combos between party members, and much more. Inquisition successfully marries the measured approach of old-school BioWare games with the flashier, action-oriented approach of Dragon Age 2 and the later Mass Effect games. The result is combat that feels pleasingly punchy when controlled directly, and tactically sound when played like a puppeteer.  Like most BioWare games before it, Inquisition isn’t without its fair share of technical annoyances. Dialogue sequences would occasionally hang, interface elements would suddenly stop working, and sound would randomly cut out in the middle of battle. Most of these could be fixed with a quick reload, but those interruptions still took me out of the experience a little too often. A day-one patch is supposed to remedy many of these issues, but if you plan to play without updating, you’re in for a bumpy ride. Where Inquisition really stumbles, though, is in its story. It gets off to a vague start, and never really congeals. The Dragon Age universe is rich with impressively nuanced lore and socio-political intrigue, but Inquisition lacks the heart and pathos of BioWare’s best games. There are some interesting individual beats, but the how and why that’s supposed to connect them is all very tenuous. It’s a shame too, because all the main characters are well-written and acted - particularly Dorian, whose familial struggles provided some genuinely emotional moments. By the time the story reached its climax though, I cared about the people involved, but I had little connection to what was at stake, or Inquisition’s completely forgettable villain.  Ultimately, the tale I was truly invested in was the one I carved out with not only the major story decisions I made, but where I spent my time, who I spent it with, and how I chose to run the Inquisition. In the war room, little mini-stories played out as I decided which of my advisors should handle different tasks, the outcomes changing depending on their aptitudes. In the the throne room I’d sit and pass judgement on those I’d brought to justice during previous quests. Who do I execute? Who do I exile? Who get’s a second chance? Combined with the excellent party banter, content like this ensured that my story remained interesting even after the curtain had fallen on the main campaign. One more thing to do after finishing the campaign is the surprisingly good online co-op, which has you leveling a totally separate character up to plow through a variety of dungeons with friends. It leverages the campaign’s enjoyable combat, and even the full-featured crafting system to boot. It isn’t a primary reason to buy Inquisition by any means, but it does boost its already substantial replay value considerably without imposing itself on you if you just want to play single-player.  When I’d finally slain my first dragon in Dragon Age: Inquisition, I felt a little sad at the thought that I was probably beginning to exhaust its seemingly endless stream of content. But then I saw the quest ticker: “Dragons Slayed - 1 out of 10.” In all my hours, I had only ever seen three. It’s a surprisingly huge, dense world, and I soon realized there were still entire sandboxes I hadn’t even set foot in. Even in my hundredth hour, I’m still discovering. Despite its less than compelling plot, I still want to go back to explore and fight through every nook and cranny of Dragon Age: Inquisition, until every dragon’s skull is mounted on my wall.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	 The Halo series has the historic distinction of inspiring millions of gamers to spend hundreds of dollars on new consoles just to play it. The Master Chief Collection – which includes all four numbered entries in the series – is a great reminder that Halo succeeded not because of hype or flavor-of-the-month popularity, but because of timeless first-person shooter design. With excellent stories, sandbox battlefields, and great AI, everything holds up against modern shooters, many of which owe a huge debt to Halo’s inspiration. It’s all presented beautifully, with remade graphics and sound that allow old hands like me to relive the glory days through rose-tinted glasses, and new fans to appreciate the classics without having to look past decade-plus-old graphics. However, Halo’s memorable multiplayer modes are undermined by unacceptably unreliable and bug-ridden performance in the days after launch, to the point where I can’t recommend that you buy Master Chief Collection right now for that functionality. That’s heartbreaking, but on the bright side there’s still more than enough single-player and co-op content here to strongly recommend it for those alone.  The fan service begins right at the main menu: a flick of the thumbstick starts playing the soundtrack of the selected game. It’s a laudable touch, considering how big a part Halo’s musical scores have played in establishing the series’ memorable atmosphere. I jumped straight to the star of the Master Chief Collection: Halo 2 Anniversary. Like 2011’s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary, Halo 2 Anniversary is actually running two graphics engines at the same time, allowing you to instantly switch from 2004 graphics to 2014’s Xbox One coat of paint and back again at the touch of a button. Admittedly, the new facade is a bit rough around the edges – I saw occasional frozen enemies, some framerate dips, and a few long loading screens that jarringly interrupt the pace as the impressive new cutscenes cue up. And while the graphics are up to modern standards in many ways, they’re hardly jaw-dropping. Some parts of the campaign seem unnecessarily dark, for instance, and I don’t agree with all of the choices made on the new art. But the sum of Halo 2 Anniversary’s parts – most notably a classic campaign that now runs at 60 frames per second – trumps its minor annoyances.  I’m giving the audio a standing ovation. Halo 2’s already-great soundtrack has been remastered, and sounds bigger and fuller while remaining reverential and respectful to the original. It’s so good I’d listen to it in my car. Meanwhile, Chief’s chunky metallic footsteps have been added, and every weapon sound has been replaced with beefier, more aggressive versions. The new Battle Rifle and sniper rifle in particular pack a satisfying wallop, but I could’ve done without the more musical Covenant energy sword and overcharged plasma pistol effect. It sounds like the Jetsons’ car floating by. You can appreciate the contrast easily, because the audio, like the visuals, also cycles between the 2004 original versions and the 2014 remastering along with the graphics. And you know what? Halo 2 remains a damn fine game, especially now that you can jump straight into Halo 3 and minimize the whiplash of that hard-stop of an ending. Bombastic set pieces like the battle on the Scarab, the Scorpion tank trek across the bridge, and the Banshee run near the end all mix with a plot that ably weaves the parallel stories of Master Chief and the Arbiter. Phenomenal new cutscenes not only breathe new life into the plot, but make me long for a feature-length CG Halo film. The best example is the stunning Gravemind scene. What was an unintentionally hilarious conversation with a featureless brown worm is now a dramatic confrontation with the hideous amalgamation of all Flood parasites, rendered here in disgusting detail.   The other three included Halo games all run at 60fps too, but all suffer from the same noticeable, but far from crippling framerate dips. That doubled speed gives the campaigns and multiplayer modes alike a newfound smoothness and polished feel. All but Halo 2 run at 1080p, which still looks good at the slightly lower resolution of 1328 by 1080. There’s no going back from this smoother framerate: the Master Chief Collection is the definitive version of each of these games. It’s great to see the lost art of local split-screen co-op multiplayer revived here, in all four games. It’s now much more playable, thanks to splitting 1080 lines of resolution between players instead of just 320, and on much larger TVs than were common a decade ago. Don’t expect to maintain 60 frames per second in split-screen, though – the dips are far more frequent this way.  Master Chief Collection’s version of Combat Evolved is based off of 2011’s Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary. It can’t match up to Halo 2 Anniversary’s Xbox One-ified upgrade, but it’s a whole lot better than dusting off your 2001 Xbox to replay this still-great game. Some things, like Chief’s relatively short jump height and inability to board vehicles, feel a bit archaic now. But the original Halo’s excellent story and still-remarkable large-scale combat sandboxes – not to mention the goosebump-inducing chanting-monks theme – make the first Halo both enjoyable and relevant in 2014. Halo 3 is probably the relative low point in the looks department. It has neither the benefit of Halo CE or Halo 2’s recent coat of Anniversary paint, nor of being fairly new like Halo 4. The resolution and framerate boosts do give it a nice, clean look, at least. And with the exception of that exacerbating “Cortana” mission, it remains arguably the series’ finest start-to-finish campaign, complete with an ending that retains all of its emotional punch.  As for Halo 4, its stunning visuals are Master Chief Collection’s most pleasant surprise. What was already a high point for graphics on Xbox 360 legitimately looks like it was made for Xbox One when running at 1080p and 60fps. Its sound design remains the best in the series, too, aside from the Battle Rifle. I wish it’d gotten the same sound thunderous effect as Halo 2 Anniversary’s version, because now it sounds like a child’s toy by comparison. Master Chief Collection also offers Campaign Playlists, a clever way to take advantage the fact that all four Master Chief adventures are under the same roof. Whether you’re playing the last levels of each campaign back-to-back or consecutively tackling every tank mission on the disc, they’re a clever addition – particularly in local or online co-op.   Tragically, online functionality has been extremely messy in the days following Master Chief Collection’s launch. I’ve seen everything from extended matchmaking wait times to being dumped into a seemingly random map and gametype option that wasn’t voted for. Additionally, crashes to desktop, freezes, parties being split up into separate teams, uneven team pairings, and custom-game oddities like mixing up the teams when time you come out of a match mean that, for the time being, you have to wrestle with Master Chief Collection just to play it online. It’s a true shame that, for now, Halo 2 was easier to play with your friends a decade ago than it is today on exponentially more powerful hardware and a more robust Xbox Live. When it works like it’s supposed to, as it did at a pre-release review event and hopefully will for everyone one day soon, Master Chief Collection’s massive multiplayer suite makes me happy. That’s primarily because it gives me two things I’ve waited years for: the ability to play Halo 2 on Xbox Live again and the chance to play the original Halo’s groundbreaking multiplayer online (which even Halo CE Anniversary spectacularly failed to give). It’s here, and on dedicated servers, no less (in matchmaking; custom games are peer-to-peer, as they always were), with the multiplayer modes of Halo 3 and 4 thrown in for good measure. After several hours rotating through the four multiplayer games and their combined 100-plus maps (every DLC map is here, save for all of Halo 4’s subpar Spartan Ops, which is due to be added via a free update in December) I’ve come to reaffirm in 2014 what I believed in 2004: Halo 2 is still the king. Running around Blood Gulch, Hang ‘em High, or Sidewinder and three-shotting my friends with Halo CE’s lethal default pistol is nostalgically satisfying, but Halo 2 made such a leap in terms of gameplay and features that it makes Halo CE feel its age more than the others.  Perhaps Halo 2’s greatest accomplishment is its incredible complement of maps, many of which remain classics. Swords-only on Lockout, 1-Flag CTF on Zanzibar, anything on Midship, – Halo 2 packs 25 maps, and 90 percent of them are gems. And long-gone but not forgotten gametypes like Fiesta are lovingly resurfaced, as are the deep customization options. For instance, I resurrected an old Coagulation map variant I created 10 years ago called Covie Gulch, which replaces the Scorpion tank with the Wraith and the Warthog with the long-absent Spectre. It’s all back, with the small but annoying exceptions of no longer being able to transfer party leadership to another person in your group and the presence of open-channel voice chat instead of Halo 2’s useful proximity/push-to-open-a-channel combo. Elsewhere, there are six Halo 2 Anniversary maps – a separate group of remakes on top of the complete original complement of Halo 2 battlegrounds – and they deserve special mention. These half-dozen built-for-Xbox One stages are, quite literally, modern takes on some of Halo 2’s best maps. They dutifully recreate the exact, welcome feel of Halo 2 in addition to the look. In fact, while it’s hard to complain about content when there’s so much of it, the six Anniversary maps are so beautiful and fun that I really wish there were more of them – particularly since they have their own matchmaking playlist on Xbox Live.  Halo 3 and 4, meanwhile, also return exactly as you remember them. For all the benefit of having every Halo multiplayer here, the downside is that it really is jarring to jump from game to game in consecutive multiplayer matches. A universal control scheme option mitigates this somewhat, but that doesn’t account for the mental and physical adjustments you have to make for the differences in jump heights, physics, weapons, etc. between each. The Battle Rifle appears in Halos 2, 3, and 4 for instance, but it is its own unique animal in each. Finally, in the context of multiplayer, the game-unifying interface is mostly successful in helping to easily parse through so many choices. I appreciate how you can press a button to go straight back to the top menu, rather than have to repeatedly B-button your way back, step by step, if you want to go do something else. One complaint, though: it oddly fails to show you a preview of your Spartan or Elite multiplayer avatar after you build it in the very same interface. The Master Chief Collection makes good on most of its promises. It packs in four full games’ worth of single-player and co-op action, all spruced up and running better than ever before. It saddens me that, because of its early online multiplayer problems, what should’ve been a celebration of the return of Halo’s old-school multiplayer greatness is currently an exercise in frustration. Right now we can only sit back and wait for Microsoft to fix its servers and party problems, and until then the greatness of revived and enhanced Halo 2 multiplayer is still an unfulfilled promise. Still, great games like this should never die. This collection delivers more than a huge Halo fan like myself could have reasonably imagined and, even with its (hopefully temporary) online issues, it packs an insane amount of first-person shooter greatness onto one disc. Here’s to reliving old memories and creating new ones, because maybe in 10 years from now, this Master Chief Collection will mean to some of you what Halo 2 meant to me a decade ago.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	" Advanced Warfare has gone to great lengths to reinvigorate Call of Duty. From the unsettling vision of powerful mercenaries run amok in 2054 America, to the cybernetically enhanced abilities, to the touch of a whole new lead development team at Sledgehammer Games, this iteration is the biggest and most successful departure from what's expected from a Call of Duty game since Modern Warfare brought the series into the 21st century. Advanced Warfare definitely hasn’t discarded the excellent, fast-paced run-and-gun shooting that made Call of Duty a household name; instead, it’s taken that strength and committed itself completely to the idea that mobility and flexibility are king, making it faster and more focused than any Call of Duty game before it.  The topics and themes of Advanced Warfare’s futuristic single-player story are lent a gravity by their reflection of contemporary real-world news: weapons of mass destruction, a dysfunctional Congress, growing private militaries, and American interventionism. It’s delivered with Call of Duty’s typical over-the-top bravado, but there’s a layer of truth beneath it all that’s genuinely scary. Actors Troy Baker and Kevin Spacey nail their roles as player character Mitchell and Atlas Corporation President Jonathan Irons, respectively. Mitchell is gruff and reserved after a personal loss, but unquestionably dangerous and loyal to those who remain. Irons speaks with unwavering confidence; he’s the kind of charismatic bad guy I can’t help but like. These characters, and the rest of the cast, are brought to life with some of the best character models and facial animations I’ve seen. Pores, hair, and creases in skin are all rendered in great detail, to the point where I knew, just by seeing how a character’s face displayed shock and horror, that bad news was coming. Those faces, as well as everything else, are far less detailed on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 than on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. Lighting is flatter and textures are less defined, and I didn't get the same ""wow"" impact out of Advanced Warfare's excellent looking weapons, environments, and characters on those platforms. More importantly, though, movement and shooting feel just as fast and fluid on old-gen consoles as they do on modern machines.   The biggest hindrance to Advanced Warfare’s story is the way it fails to establish its characters’ human relationships. For instance, the earliest interaction we see is Mitchell and a fellow Marine; we’re told the two are inseparable brothers in arms who’ve served together for months, but some of their conversations seem as though they’ve just met, and come off as artificial exposition. The same thing happens when Irons gives Mitchell a tour of Atlas headquarters -- there’s no way Mitchell wouldn’t already know all about the world’s biggest mercenary army. And, like most Call of Duty campaigns, this one ends about six hours later with a confusing, cheesy moment that doesn’t quite tie off Advanced Warfare’s story threads. Between those story bookends, Advanced Warfare admirably takes some risks with how its campaign plays, and on nearly all fronts, it succeeds. This is still a Call of Duty game, which means you can expect a handful of the tired, stereotypical missions where the guy in front of you has a big “follow me” symbol above his head. Most level designs are as tightly linear as they’ve ever been, however almost all come with a unique gadget that changes how you take on the somewhat repetitive human and drone enemies and keeps them feeling fresh. If you’re given a sonic emitter to stun enemies, you’ll be able to take on larger groups. If you’re given a grappling hook, you can play cat and mouse by darting around corners and on rooftops. One level lets you drive a hover tank, and one level takes place beneath a crumbling glacier. A few powerful missions open up and give you some real freedom in a way that’ll surprise Call of Duty campaign veterans. In Advanced Warfare’s stealth level, for example, I grappled onto ledges, sneaked through bushes, and scouted to find unguarded paths through heavily patrolled areas. The stealth mechanics are just nuanced enough to be tough, but not so finicky that I didn’t know know why I’d failed. For once, Call of Duty made me feel like a badass without needing to blow anything up. Its main failing is that being spotted causes an automatic trip back to your checkpoint, because Call of Duty doesn’t know how to handle a transition from stealth to combat.   What’s truly impressive, though, is how Advanced Warfare occasionally pulls off what would have been a barely interactive action set piece moment in a previous game. In one level a massive airship flew into combat and fired down on me. Without a hint of a quick-time event prompt, I grappled onto a nearby building, leapt off, hooked myself into the ship, killed everyone on board, then bailed out to safety as the airship crashed. I came up with that plan, and executing it felt great. When I learned I could’ve simply shot the gunship down from the ground instead, it felt even better. Your arsenal is impressive, too, with a variety of mostly typical but great-sounding weapons, grenades, and, gadgets to get the job done. A few stand out, like the Threat Grenades that highlight enemies through walls, directed energy weapons (or “lasers,” if you will) that burn through armor, and a wide variety of weapon attachments that can turn your conventional shotgun into a fast-firing monster of death. The one design decision seemingly made in the name of variety that I felt harmed my enjoyment of Advanced Warfare is that we don’t get access to the full range of Exo movement abilities in every campaign level. You won’t always be able to zip around freely whenever you want, and sometimes your speed is sacrificed for other gadgets. Though they’re all fun and useful in different ways, but having a liberating mobility power taken away feels crippling. The Exo suit is the kind of change I was looking for in Call of Duty multiplayer. It’s intuitive, fun, and it affects everything you do. From the first moments I was boosting and dodging in firefights to make myself a harder target. After just a few matches, I started using my mobility to my advantage before the next fight even started. If I saw a ledge, roof, or open window, I knew I could probably leap to it quickly and get the jump on enemies below. If someone started shooting me first, I was able to “creatively retreat” in ways that weren’t possible in a Call of Duty game until now. And that’s just in the context of killing. Modes like Capture the Flag feel way more intense now that the carrier can boost 40 feet in the air and disappear with a flash. I felt like I had to be on top of my game, and when I scored a kill, it felt hard-earned and well deserved.   My first hours were filled with satisfying new experiences as I augmented my old tactics with new abilities. Is a fortified sniper taking shots at you from across the map? Take a safe approach toward it and just use your dash to pass through the open areas with minimal risk. Does your shotgun have crazy power but no range? Boost up into an opponent’s face before pulling the trigger. Suits also come with power slots on top of their innate boost and dash abilities in which you can equip invisibility, enhanced speed, a health boost, a grenade deflector, and more. They’re all fun and useful in different ways, but I often found myself never using the powers that took a second to activate. When you take a fast shooter and make it even faster, that second is the difference between life and death. The powers often felt like they were going to waste. However, since the Exo is an excellent multi-purpose tool, I can’t wait to see how some of the best Call of Duty players will use it. Since Modern Warfare, Call of Duty has excelled at giving you rewards to earn in multiplayer. Advanced Warfare follows that tradition, but greatly accelerates the pace. I quickly earned supply drops full of cosmetic items, new weapons, and temporary perks, like a double XP boost. Finding a gun I liked was great; finding another version of that gun with better stats and a cool weapon skin is even better. There are also more attachments than ever before, and each one I unlocked did distinct things that changed how I played. One weapon sight highlights enemies through walls, essentially enabling a wall hack. These unlocks complement the traditional XP system and challenges for each specific weapon, which offer new camo patterns as you score more kills and headshots. Despite the wealth of items and skins to earn, it never feels overwhelming, and I never felt compelled to use anything I didn’t want to.   The Pick 13 system, which expands on Black Ops 2’s Pick 10, gave me all the flexibility I could ask for. For example: lots of people aren’t good enough to make use of some of the higher-level kills streaks, so why have them? Just get rid of the streak option all together, and use that extra slot to give your primary weapon an extra attachment or a second perk. “Play how you want” isn’t just an ideal; it’s baked into Advanced Warfare at a fundamental level. One of my favorite new features complements the constant stream of unlocked weapons, perks, and cosmetic items. From the lobby, one button drops you into a virtual firing range where you can safely test your new gear without fear of learning the weaknesses of a new loadout the hard way. It’s convenient and extremely useful, and it should absolutely become standard in any loadout-based multiplayer shooter from here on out.  The new collection of maps and modes make great use of the Exo suit by enabling vertical movement. Most maps have a mixture of wide-open areas where Exo movements are useful, and close-quarters areas that enable more traditional Call of Duty action. Modes like Uplink and CTF benefit from the hectic, fast-paced Exo movements, and others, like the one-life-only Search and Destroy, rein you back and make you question jumping around wildly. I was constantly shifting between totally free motion and the careful “check your corners” style I’ve used for years, which was demanding but ensured I never felt safe simply falling into my old Call of Duty habits. If you’re rusty, you can jump into the Combat Readiness Program before trying out true multiplayer. It’s a noob-friendly environment where there are no kill cams, no post-game scoreboards, and a mixture of nameless bots and players. Anyone who racks up too high a body count gets locked out to avoid discouraging new players, making it a much more casual-friendly zone where you can kick back and enjoy yourself without pressure. The third mode in Advanced Warfare is a wave-based cooperative mode called “Exo Survival,” where the fun comes from never knowing what’s going to happen next. One moment you’re fighting attack dogs, then you’re collecting intel, then you’re fending off giant robots, then you’re shooting invisible enemies. It’s a nice mixture of defensive and offensive objectives, and working together with up to three friends and picking complementary Exos is crucial as the waves become more difficult. The difficulty doesn’t ramp up quite as quickly as it should, though, so after you spend your unlock points on upgraded suits and weapons within a round, you’ll do a fair bit of waiting for the challenge to kick in.  Simply throwing a robot suit onto Call of Duty could have been a lazy path to making Advanced Warfare seem different from what we’ve played before, but the way Sledgehammer has integrated its enhanced abilities and choices into every aspect of how we fight went above and beyond. By designing the levels in the campaign, co-op, and multiplayer to facilitate those new mechanics, Advanced Warfare is granted a weight and importance that changes how the fast-paced shooting action feels in all three modes. This is a Call of Duty game to its core, but one that rehashes as little as possible while still retaining its strengths."
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/30/costume-quest-2-console-review	" Your parents were wrong: a second helping of candy won't make you sick. To the contrary, Costume Quest 2 is an even tastier morsel than the original Costume Quest, and serves up an even bigger bag of accessible humor and combat. There are a few sour patches within this fun-sized roleplaying game, especially when it comes to the flawed healing system, but as a whole, it's a tiny treat.  Costume Quest 2's combat as a whole deserves commendation; it's not quite at the level of epics like Persona 4, but it’s deep enough that the turn-based battles never got repetitive over this five to six-hour campaign like they did in the original. Between the ability to add a second attack if the first is timed right, and the option to charge a block for one character and turn it into a counter (trading off that you might not react in time if the enemy attacks one of the other two) it gave me something to think about. The buff system, now implemented via ""Creepy Treat Cards,"" offers a bit more freedom than Costume Quest's Battle Stamps. While the original required you attach a single attribute to each character with only 24 modifiers to play with, there's 45 different Creepy Treat Cards which can be used by any character at any time in battle with a three-to-five battle cooldown period. Most importantly, Creepy Treat Cards aren't mandatory like Battle Stamps, so you can forgo them for extra challenge. There's a far bigger challenge in the form of the inanimate HP-sponge Candy Corn costume that trades a third of your attack options in each battle for a clever quip about the Halloween staple and if you're playing on a non-Nintendo platform, a hard-earned Achievement/Trophy at the end of your quest. Unfortunately the difficulty balance is thrown off a bit due to the awkward healing system. In my review of the PC version of Costume Quest 2 (now patched to match the console version) I found it had a pretty serious issue that forced you to regularly re backtracking to one of the scattered water fountains. That’s fixed now, by an option to heal an entire party for a nominal fee of the ""Candy"" currency. While it's certainly better, this solution is like a Band-Aid on an ax wound. Healing classes and items are unimportant vestiges of a system that no longer exists (especially the Creepy Treat Cards that heal allies after battles), and healing is so cheap it might as well be free, removing almost all consequences of taking damage and any resource management for healing. While an overly simple healing system is better than a tedious one, there’s got to be a better middle ground. Another issue that interferes with the fun is navigation, as making your way through Costume Quest 2's world is far more difficult than you'd expect from a game that appears so accessible. You can buy a map that’ll reveal a new area, but you still have to figure out where you are on that map, because it doesn’t use any kind of location marker to tell you. While that's not an issue with some of the more wide-open areas at the beginning of the campaign, more than one of the future-set stages included far more twists and turns than the map could detail, due in part to Costume Quest 2's insistence on drawing maps in the style of crude childrens’ drawings. Yet Costume Quest 2 won me over with the colorful locales and endearing characters that popped up during Reynold and Wren's second quest to save Halloween. The time travel and resulting dystopian locations like an oppressive school and a Metropolis-style slum, are great, even if the objectives haven't evolved much beyond the knocking on doors and getting tricks or treats we did in the original. I did miss a few the charming moments because of Costume Quest 2' s itchy trigger finger. On more than one occasion each, I accidentally skipped a cutscene (that could not be replayed due to autosaving) with a single wayward button tap, or accepted loss in a battle by mistakenly scrolling over to the ""run away"" option. A simple ""are you sure?"" prompt in each situation would have done wonders. The main villain is a sugar-hating dentist who actually has personality; a big improvement over the original’s forgettable candy-stealing monsters. The time traveling also allows you to see multiple forms of the same NPCs, which helps to even make the most common-seeming bystander a bit more memorable. That, and constant references back to old Double Fine games and Earthbound, which is one of the biggest influences for Costume Quest, make Costume Quest 2 a cute and lighthearted seasonal RPG despite a few dips in the action due to a quirky health system and maddening map navigation. Costume Quest 2 is now virtually everywhere, and for this review I played on Xbox One, Xbox 360, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and Wii U. It’s interesting that, for a game with such basic character models (outside of battle, at least), the visual differences between console generations are striking. On PlayStation 4 and Xbox One there's a noticeable upgrade in framerate, as well as ambient environmental effects like shadow-casting streetlights and reflections in the various bodies of water. On the bright side, the lower-end performance on 360, PS3, and Wii U never interfered with combat timing or my overall enjoyment. Costume Quest 2 on Wii U fails to take any advantage of the GamePad, as the second screen is only used to show the same art that pops up in every version's loading screen. To its credit, it does change for every new area you visit. Costume Quest 2's combat and story are both surprisingly good for an RPG that concludes in roughly a half-dozen hours. Navigation is iffy, and the healing system is a bit broken even after a major revision, but its humor and personality shine through to make this a good Halloween bounty."
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/28/nba-live-15-review	 A good basketball coach will always drill into his team that the most important thing they can do is practice their fundamentals. Basics like dribbling, shooting, and moving around the court. That’s NBA Live 15’s problem in a nutshell - no matter what minor additions and improvements it makes, it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t bring the feeling of controlling the moment-to-moment basketball up to standard.  Let’s give NBA Live 15 credit where it’s due. This year’s game looks better in nearly every way compared to last year’s, particularly during close ups. The ESPN license, specifically the lengthy halftime report with Jalen Rose, adds a level of authenticity, even though Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy’s commentary is flatly delivered. Animations are still stiff, though, and that causes big issues. While slightly improved from a year ago, the controls still feel clumsy and even unresponsive at times. And because the overall pace has been sped up, NBA Live 15 ends up feeling like NBA Jam, just without the fun of the “Boom Shakalaka!” arcadey movements and a realistic look just clash. Light physics have been added this year, but only in particular cases, and only within the key. For instance, the players react to each other in a more natural way when fighting for a rebound or taking a charge, and it looks pretty realistic. But when an animated layup or dunk sequence is triggered, it pulls everyone into position in an unnatural way. It makes the outcome feel predetermined. The best part of NBA Live 15’s gameplay is working the pick & roll, which is extremely satisfying when pulled off. You simply hold L2 or Left Trigger to call a teammate to set a pick for you. He’ll stay in that position as long as you hold the button, however this  is not always reliable. Based on the position of the defenders, and how the player you’re controlling is behaving, an icon above the pick setter’s head will dynamically change, signifying what he’s going to do next. It’s a fantastic idea, and I really wish it worked consistently. But improvements like this give me hope that the Live franchise is, at least, headed in a positive direction.  Sadly, even when the pick is executed flawlessly, you’re faced with another problem. Scoring points, the main objective in basketball, is counterintuitive in NBA Live 15. This new shot-quality indicator is added beneath your player’s feet, and it’s supposed to help you visualize when you’re open and within range. But it’s too complicated to be useful in the heat of the moment, and seems like it’s not always accurate. I eventually got the timing down, once I figured out that the shot-release point seems abnormally quick, and it’s not close to the apex of the jump as you’d expect. Meanwhile, layups and dunks are still way too easy to pull off, and too hard to stop when playing defense.  The game modes from a year ago all return, with a few minor improvements. Rising Star mode, a knockoff of NBA 2K’s MyCareer mode, is almost identical to last year, except there are more opportunities to improve your grade when playing within your role. But it’s still way easier to lose points than to gain points, and it felt like I was getting robbed. Playing as a slashing point guard, I found it nearly impossible to come off a screen and have the computer register my shot as an open jumper. Almost every time, even if I felt like I was wide open, I lost points for taking a so-called “contested shot”, even though the defender had his hands raised on the other side of the screen! The one notable difference to Dynasty mode, the dull front-office managing Franchise mode, is the ability to jump into a simulated game at virtually any point. That’s kinda cool. Ultimate Team, the standard card collecting  game you’ve seen a dozen times, only adds an auction house, where you can buy or sell individual items. And Big Moments mode still promises to add important moments from the NBA season as they happen, like Damian Lillard’s game winning shot in the playoffs. The thing is, the moments don’t feel as “big” as they should. After you complete the challenge, there are no congratulatory animations, or really anything at all. It just dumps you into a leaderboard. Although NBA Live 15 looks significantly better than NBA Live 14 at a glance, it still suffers from clumsy controls and stiff animations. A few nice changes and additional game modes can’t make up for poor gameplay, but there are some great ideas here that just don’t get a chance to shine, like the pick & roll and the ESPN license. All in all, NBA Live doesn’t feel as hopeless as it did a year ago, but hope doesn’t make a good basketball game. Practice those fundamentals!
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	 Sunset Overdrive has ruined my attention span, and honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way. During my 30-hour trip through developer Insomniac's insane but endearing depiction of the apocalypse, I strayed off the beaten path more than I have in any other open-world game in recent memory. Despite the mini-map encouraging me to head 400 meters east, I couldn't help but veer off the route at every opportunity.  This isn't due to a lack of interesting things to do, but rather a testament to the abundance of them. Because of Sunset's superb traversal, impeccable comedic writing, and wealth of upgrade paths for my character and weapons, I was more than happy to take the road less traveled. More often than not, it led me someplace that I'm thoroughly glad I visited. Sunset Overdrive visually pops, like the Easter Bunny on an acid trip. Its bright colors, punk-rock attitude, and nose turned up in the direction of authority all meld together wonderfully. Like the cult-classic Jet Set Radio, Sunset assaulted my senses with a never-ending barrage of stimulus. Monsters explode into an ocean of bright-orange viscera, certain weapons allow you fire off a torrent of blazing fireworks, and freezing enemies will result in the word “BRRRR” appearing in the air above them. I really appreciate that Insomniac has crafted a world that successfully adheres to a strong, unique, and artistic vision. This distinct style transcends aesthetics, and actually aids in Sunset's most successful and often-used mechanics. Like most any open-world game, the mission structure here has you talking to a character at point A, making your way across the map to point B, and engaging in some activity that usually results in being sent to collect a reward at point C. While that structure might sound monotonous, Sunset makes the very act of traversal a constant joy instead of an obligatory trudge. I rarely found myself using the fast travel system, because this is a game that’s about the journey as much as the destination. Narrative conceit be damned, your hero or heroine can, using nothing but their own two feet, bounce off anything remotely buoyant, dash through the air, and grind on all manners of power lines, billboards, and anything that presents a right angle -- now all I want is for Insomniac to make a Spider-Man game. In fact all of this is encouraged thanks to a punitively slow regular ground running speed, the rewards of a smart combo system, and an ridiculous abundance of monsters, soldiers, and robots. Seriously, if you find yourself on the ground for more than 10 seconds, deprived of your godly mobility, chances are you’re going to end up dead shortly after that. But Sunset wisely avoids harsh punishments with quick respawns with amusing animations that lovingly pay homage - in clever ways - to dozens of classic works, from Portal to Terminator to Night of the Living Dead. As long as you keep moving and refrain from lingering on the ground, Sunset’s combat proves to be deep, entertaining, and rewarding. I loved fighting enemies like the giant Hurkers, as each encounter felt like a mini-boss fight in and of itself. There’s a great sense of tension in trying to stay moving while maintaining the high ground. And thanks to Sunset’s deep and varied arsenal, I found myself creating some really interesting combos: I’d start off by peppering the area with freeze bombs, which bought me enough time to lay down a field of Acid Sprinklers, and finish it all off with a cascade of exploding teddy bears.   While all of that looks and feels awesome in motion, it definitely isn’t easy. The controls in Sunset aren't simple: by the time you gain a full suite of weapons and traversal abilities, your hands will be getting a serious workout trying to manage them all. But while it certainly felt cumbersome initially, leading to a stretch of hours where my fingers always felt just a fraction of a second behind where my mind was, I eventually acclimated to the complex system and even grew to appreciate it. For sure, by the end of the campaign, I still found myself having to work to navigate this hand-eye-coordination spaghetti bowl when I had to grind on a wire, kill a horde of monsters below me, hop off, switch weapons and kill an airborne bat-thingy, and air dash towards the nearest bounding so I could wall-ride around its outside. But while it might be a bit complicated, the result of mastering the system and eventually being able to make it across the entirety of the city without ever setting foot on the pavement is wildly satisfying. That prior example of insanity is just one of hundreds that I remember fondly. I love telling other people my stories about my time in Sunset Overdrive, because they seem to be just that: my stories. If I wanted to put on a wolf mask and fire off explosive teddy bears at a group of robots, I could do just that. Sunset treats its open world as a canvas for you to express yourself aesthetically, through movement, and of course, through combat.   It also felt personalized by the fact that weapons and abilities are upgraded based on how often you use them. The more I bounced across the city, the more opportunities I had to add an explosion to my jumps. Everytime I killed a robot with an Acid Sprinkler, I inched closer to upgrading both my weapon, as well as my skills against robots. Not only does it reward your playstyle, but it also encouraged me to experiment with other weapons in order to see how they’d evolve over time. Combat reaches new levels of insanity when you hop into Chaos Squad, Sunset Overdrive’s eight-player cooperative multiplayer missions. These unfold as wave-based siege defenses where you’re given a brief amount of time to lay traps and coordinate with your buddies before all hell breaks loose. The ensuing spectacle of blood, guts, lightning, ice, lasers, and giant fireworks is insanity of the highest caliber. But while Chaos Squad is a neat diversion, it didn’t grab me quite as tightly as the single-player campaign managed to. Weaving in and out of this self-expression is also one of most consistently funny scripts in recent memory. From pop culture deep cuts to fourth-wall-breaking remarks about the nature of video games, I found myself genuinely laughing at Sunset Overdrive throughout the entire campaign. The voice work is great, the supporting cast is varied and interesting (spend 30 seconds with the robot dog and it’s tough not to fall in love), and I found myself weirdly obsessed with uncovering the events that led to this apocalypse. Sunset Overdrive is big, gorgeous, and a hell of a lot of fun. Never has getting from point A to point B in an open-world game provided so much enjoyment. It provides some of the most fun, frantic, and fantastic gaming I've had on the Xbox One. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to once-again adorn my wolf mask, leap off the highest ledge I can find, and fire an explosive stuffed animal at that group of angry robots.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-legend-of-korra-the-game-review	" Looking at the faithful art style of this Legend of Korra game, which comes from reputable developer Platinum, the optimist in me had high hopes that it would make good use of the Avatar: The Last Airbender universe and its awesome elemental-infused martial-arts superpowers. It turns out to be much closer to what my inner cynic expected: a poorly made tie-in that can’t even stand up as a competent third-person action game, much less something I could recommend to a fan of the show. What a disappointment.  As you’d expect from a rote video game adaptation, the ""story"" has Avatar Korra immediately robbed of her water, earth, fire, and air-bending powers and forces her to reactivate them one at a time. And as you’d expect, combat against generic, mostly palette-swapped enemies is painfully simplistic (though it is challenging) and takes place in a series of bland, featureless arenas. It’s especially bad in the first few hours of its approximately five-hour campaign. Every move Korra has is executed with a combination of just the X and Y buttons, with the triggers dedicated to countering on the left and dodging on the right – so it’s inherently button-mashy. To be fair, it does get better over time. Once I’d gotten the hang of its annoyingly short counter timing windows and leveled up my bending skills I was able to pull off some attack strings that resembled the beatdowns Korra delivers to her adversaries in the show. Freezing them in ice, blowing them away in a whirlwind, blasting them with fireballs, and crushing them with boulders is impressively animated, so long as the enemies don’t glitch out. It just never felt that good, even with the elaborate quick-time event finishing moves, and it took until I began my second playthrough of a game I didn’t really want to finish the first time to unlock enough moves for it to become remotely rewarding. Enemy variety isn’t terrible, but their baffling lack of resistances or vulnerabilities to any specific element means you almost never have to vary your attacks. I used water for distant or flying foes, earth for bashing them up close, air for crowd control, and fire for when I wanted to lose. What’s more, there’s no incentive to mix things up to create multiple-element combos. That seems like a waste, given that you’re the Avatar. Perhaps the most offensive part about The Legend of Korra: The Game is that, as a fan of the show, I could barely detect a hint of the wit and charm that makes its characters endearing. That’s partially because there essentially is no writing - just short, repetitive bursts of uncharacteristic and unimaginative smack-talk - and partially because Korra is effectively the only character who appears at all. A completely unanimated and badly voice-impersonated Jinora floats around giving advice on how to unlock your powers; Sidekicks Mako and Bolin show up for literally 15 seconds in an early cutscene before being knocked off screen and out of the game; Iroh has two lines of dialogue that repeat every time you visit the item store; Tenzin, Asami, Lin, Meelo, Ikki, Bumi, and the rest are complete no-shows. In fact, even the cutscenes are poor – they look to be animated at about 10 frames per second and feel slightly off-model. It’s embarrassing. A close second on the terribleness scale is Iroh’s item store. This is a fairly tough game on normal difficulty, and I was routinely beaten up by earth, fire, and water-bending enemies until I got some decent moves. That’d be fine, except for that when you die, all of the health potions and buffs you’ve used (and the points you used to acquire them) stay gone. That means they must be repurchased and re-equipped every single time, or you can’t heal at all. It’s a genuinely stupid system. You can even end up in a situation where one of the obnoxiously durable and repetitious bosses kills you enough that you run out of money and have to fight with no healing ability whatsoever, or go back to an earlier stage and grind for currency. The Legend of Korra: The Game isn’t all combat, though when I’d played the endless-runner minigame interjected every few levels I wished it was. It’s actually not a terrible endless runner, but the addition of a few bending-themed powers like fireballs to destroy obstacles and launching yourself into the air with earth-bending doesn't make it a good one either, and it looks absurd to see Korra riding her polar bear/dog hybrid mount Naga as she makes disorienting 90-degree turns at high speed. Tacking on another mediocre mode of play doesn’t improve this game - and that goes for the Pro Bending minigame, too. I have no idea who The Legend of Korra: The Game is for. It’s definitely not for young fans of Korra, as the combat is too unforgiving, the boss battles too tedious, the economy ridiculously punishing, and the story too weak and lacking any of the show’s charm. It’s not for older people who enjoy a good action game, because next to contemporaries like Batman: Arkham City, Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor, and even Platinum’s own Bayonetta 2, Korra looks terrible with its simple two-button combos and poor combat scenario design. I can’t recommend it to anyone."
Miranda Sanchez	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/fantasia-music-evolved-review	 Disney’s Fantasia and Fantasia 2000 are magical films that give classical music new life through beautiful imagery; Fantasia: Music Evolved is a Kinect game that does just that, and more. Developer Harmonix borrows both classical and contemporary music, inserts them into Disney lore, and combines it all with unique gameplay in some beautiful realms to create a great new experience that reminded me of the fun a novel music game can inspire.  After playing a few easy but helpful introductory games, you’ll complete your apprenticeship under sorcerer Yen Sid and move on to beautifully designed and widely varied realms, such as a mystical forest and a space station, to play through songs and minigames to defeat a destructive force called The Noise. The story is enjoyable, though an unimportant side note as you unlock music for your song library, learn spells to customize songs, and uncover new realms. Fantasia relies entirely on Kinect motion controls for navigation, gameplay, and everything in between, and in general it works really well. The movements feel similar to conducting, but the interactivity goes beyond simply keeping time with the music. Your sweeping, punching, holding, and path-following motions instead mimic rhythms and signal new musical phrases, which is a lot more fun than just counting a beat. Each motion is cued by an animation that bursts into a beautiful flurry of glitter if you hit them correctly; if you miss, the music will soften and you may lose your streak – but no matter how much you mess up, you can’t fail the song. The closest you get to “failure” is not hitting a goal, which is, in a way, the same thing, yet it’s friendlier to young kids and people who just want to create music without judgment. The only problem I had with the controls was trying to grab something off in the distance. That can be a pain, especially in certain minigames. Two other major actions can completely transform a song, and make Fantasia’s gameplay feel unique and personal in a way I’ve never seen a music game try before. The first is a set of simple “Composition” spells, which allow you to create your own beat, rhythm, or phrase through gestures, then automatically integrate them into the song. Hearing something I created become a part of a song I love is a great feeling that borders on “magical.”  The other type, Remix cues, aren’t as personal, but offer another good option for customization between the different verses of a song. When hit correctly, the remix cue will increase your score multiplier and allow you pull in an element from one of two available remixes of each song. For example, you could opt to exchange the string line in Mussorgsky’s Night on Bald Mountain for a synthesizer, or the guitar and piano of Fun’s Some Nights for a horn line. While it's great to create music on your own, working with a friend to create new elements for songs is even more enjoyable. Composition spells split recording time in half, so each player has a chance to add something to the song. The person in control of the Remix cue alternates, so it’s possible to have a wonky-sounding song if your partner chooses a radically different remix. This sounds like it could be a nuisance, but with the right partner it’s fun to collaborate to revamp the sound of the song.  Though you’ll work together during the creation parts, you are still competing against your partner for a higher score, which serves as a fun motive to hit more cues than your partner. My co-op partner originally agreed to playing one song with me, but that one song quickly turned into three as we got into it and the competition drove us forward. In a nice touch, Fantasia sidesteps the annoyance of unwrapping your copy to play with friends and finding most of the songs locked out with Party Mode. It suspends your ability to complete goals, but opens up all 33 songs on the playlist. Fantasia: Music Evolved provides a surprising amount of control and personalization options over each song, which is paired with fun gameplay to bring a fresh new style to the music game genre. Though the navigation motion controls could be improved, Kinect functions well for the moment-to-moment creative play, and Fantasia’s diverse music selection, beautiful realms, and blended co-op mode, combine to create a great new experience.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	 After my 23.5 hours with The Evil Within on its standard Survival mode, I was informed I had been eaten alive, had my head shattered, and my torso sliced into thirds a whopping 218 times. This wickedly creative, tense, and yes, tough game does not suffer fools gladly, yet I was compelled to return to it after the screen bled to red every time. That, I believe, is the definition of a great survival horror experience. The Evil Within is aesthetically, functionally, and spiritually in step with director Shinji Mikami’s last foray into the genre, the iconic Resident Evil 4. It’s not simply a rehash of that game, though, as Mikami and his new development studio Tango Gameworks have delivered a harder, bleaker game this time around.  Not that the plot is a strikingly original work for the horror genre. The Evil Within is an investigation of what appears to be a multiple homicide at Beacon Mental Hospital in its fictional Krimson City, before you realize things are not as they seem (an understatement). While its central mystery starts off as compelling, it gradually veers off course, and eventually buckles under the weight of its own unfocused ambition. I found its ending in particular, complete with an unnecessary boss battle apparently inserted only to serve the story, disappointing. In part, this narrative wrapper is undermined by the rather lifeless player character, Detective Sebastian Castellanos, who is emotionless and cool to the point of parody. Sebastian still quips mundanities like “what is going on here?” after hours of facing the kind of monsters that would drive the average person into a jabbering wreck. It’s hard to care about the stakes when it appears that he doesn’t, even if his calm detachment - “I must be losing it!” - is on occasion darkly comic. While far from subtle - this is about as excessive as a horror game gets - Tango has created some incredibly strange and wonderful places in The Evil Within’s 15 chapters. Even the usual horror cliches have been twisted and contorted in imaginative ways; meat lockers, clanging industrial interiors, and mannequins have been granted new and ghastly life. Zooming in, these places are small and linear level designs, yet with the aid of excellent lighting, they become claustrophobic and labyrinthian. Despite a little roughness around the edges  - I noticed texture pop-up and clipping issues in the PS4 and Xbox One versions  - the game has been beautifully designed.  Tango has employed a keen eye for composition in The Evil Within, and interiors are grimy, full of looming shadows, ornate architecture, and ominous escape routes. They create a terrifying mood of expectation. Once or twice I found myself ducking to avoid an attacker that was revealed to be my own (harmless) shadow, or running from an unseen enemy only to realize nobody was chasing me bar the groans of some distant foe. Otherwise, the threat here is very real. Enemies that pepper these places are plentiful, unpredictable, and smart. Initially evoking Resident Evil 4’s shambling ganados, they get weirder as The Evil WIthin progresses; not quite The Infected, more The Perverted; designed with an eye toward childhood nightmares and heavily inspired by Japanese horror movies. I wouldn’t be surprised to see some of these foes - in particular, the unforgettable Keeper boss - come to define The Evil Within as time moves on, cosplayed for years and endlessly re-imagined in fan art.  It is The Evil Within’s most unnerving juxtaposition that combat with these terrors is so grounded in reality. You are given only a modest but well-balanced arsenal - the usual pistol, shotgun, sniper rifle, grenade and crossbow combo - with which to fight, as well as basic melee. And while the crossbow caters to a variety of special attacks (freeze, electrocute, harpoon, etc) and shooting is as satisfyingly crunchy as you would expect from Mikami, you have little ammo, first aid, or even stamina at your disposal. Cruelly, for a game where I spent a lot of time running away, Sebastian runs out of puff very quickly. Checkpoints are scarce, so the stakes in this hostile world are high, making for exhilarating experiences regardless of whether you decide to flee or fight as these creatures run - screaming - towards you. The Evil Within does cater somewhat to those who wish to choose the stealth route, although the AI feels unfairly tuned in on you. You can lay traps or distract enemies by throwing bottles and sneak up behind them for a stealth kill, but more often than not they’ll turn around at the last second, or will have already spotted you several seconds ago. Playing stealthily works in fits and starts, but I did not find it the most accessible gameplay style to adopt. Of course, you’re not completely powerless. One of The Evil Within’s most enjoyable mechanics is its simple upgrade system. ‘Green gel’ is the limited resource that you use to improve your abilities, weapons, stock and crossbow bolts while in safe houses, and it’s dispersed throughout the world like hidden gold, becoming your most sought after resource.  While cashing in this gel makes for strong dilemmas of choice - do you upgrade your shotgun damage, or do you want to be able to run for longer? - I liked how it let me shape my own gameplay style and gave me a brief, if generally illusory, sense of control of the situation.  Such pockets of calm are welcome because it's chaos, not control, that is the point of The Evil Within. The pacing of the action and horror propels you forward at breakneck speed, moving from one climactic encounter to the next with little to no reprieve. Throughout my playthrough, I always felt on the backfoot, and the times when I was really on the backfoot - I’m talking six in the sniper rifle chamber facing a close-combat boss, here - produced some of the most incredible moments I’ve experienced in any video game for years. It had me sweaty-palmed, heart in my throat, for most of its duration.   PC Version - October 16, 2014 The PC port of The Evil Within plays much the same as the console versions, and as such is locked into a cinematic 2:35:1 aspect ratio. That's a bit of an issue - I played on a small 22-inch monitor, and the thick black letterbox bars at the top and bottom of the screen eventually did impede my enjoyment of The Evil Within by simply not allowing me to see enough of it. This was a problem I did not experience at all playing on my 40-inch TV screen, and it's something to take into consideration when deciding which version to pick up, depending on your home set-up. Another thing to be aware of is that The Evil Within on PC is locked at 30fps by default. Video options in the menu are slim, but you can change this to 60fps via (unsupported) debug console commands. Running at the latter framerate, I did notice stuttering when moving the camera around swiftly from left to right – not ideal when in the midst of a breathless firefight. All things considered, I preferred it at a steady 30fps. The video options in The Evil Within are slim. One other little criticism: the mouse controls in the menu screen lag significantly, although performed fine for me in-game. Ultimately, the experience I had on PC is pretty much the same as you’ll get playing on console, which might disappointment high-end PC users. Although I experienced no crashes while running it on an Intel Core i7-3770 CPU and Nvidia GeForce GTX680, that’s about as high as my praise goes for this port on a technical level. The Evil Within is a brutal, challenging, and remarkably fun game. Its eerie world and imaginative enemies are genuinely frightening, and the scares are heightened significantly by the scarcity of resources at your disposal. It keeps the odds stacked against you to the point that they often feel insurmountable, yet it’s finely tuned to ensure that they never really are, as long as you can keep a cool head and a steady aim in the face of building panic. While its story ends up buckling under its own ambition, there is little here that takes away from the joy of experiencing survival horror under the steady hand of a master of the craft.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/14/defense-grid-2-review	 Just like the 2008 original, Defense Grid 2 is the kind of game I can sit down with intending to play a quick 30 minutes, only to look up and find three hours have passed. This brand of extremely addictive min-maxing tower defense retains all the strength of the first game and adds a new layer of complexity that promises to extend replayablity - even if it can’t repeat the original’s unexpectedly emotional story.  This isn’t one of those sequels that sets out to reinvent itself, so its 20 levels are largely slight variations on the excellent Defense Grid puzzles we’ve done before: a stream of alien invaders run the same path to your precious power cores and attempt to abscond with them (generally along the same path they came in on) while you attempt to fry them with a selection of strategically placed upgradable gun turrets. It’s a game of meticulous min-maxing optimization, and it inspires obsessive levels of tweaking tower placement and resource expenditures by making it extremely easy and consequence-free to jump back in time a few seconds to prevent an alien from escaping with an orbital laser blast, or rethink that hard-hitting laser tower in favor of a concussion tower that’s better for taking out the incoming swarm of small targets. Defense Grid 2 contributes some relatively minor tweaks and increased variety. Versatile new Boost towers allow you to cheaply block off alien routes to extend the amount of time you have to beat on them, build towers on top of them to gain elevation for better firing angles, and upgrade them with power- or score-boosting effects. Since Defense Grid 2 very wisely ditches the annoying flying enemies that could only be effectively destroyed with Missile towers, the Missile towers are now redesigned to attack ground targets. That makes them feel a bit redundant to the also long-range Meteor tower, but their stats are different enough to make them useful in different scenarios. You can differentiate them further with unlockable modifiers that allow you to alter towers with traits like improved splash damage, at the cost of lower overall damage, or enhanced effectiveness against shields. You can also pick an alternate superweapon, such as a time-slowing device or an extra resource infusion. I’m excited about all the extra replayability I’ll get out of Defense Grid 2 because of this, but I’m a little annoyed I have to lock them in before I start a match. It leads to situations where I have to play once, quit all the way out, change my settings, and start up again. The other significant new feature is that you can spend resources to change the layout of a level in pre-set ways, raising or moving chunks of track or buildable pads. The option to spend money on things other than a new tower or an upgrade opens up lots of new possibilities - having already gold-medaled 18 of 20 levels by barely touching this option, I was intrigued when I started opening up entirely new strategies on certain maps. On top of all of this, there are now eight mode modifiers you can apply to any of the 20 maps. There’s one with 100 waves of enemies (up from the usual 20 to 30), one that allows you to directly deal damage by hovering the cursor over an alien, and one that prevents the cores from traveling back to the center of the map when the alien carrying it is killed. It gives you lots of extra ways to play, and each mode has its own leaderboard – fighting for dominance on those can create some intense rivalry.  I found the biggest disappointment in the story – though in the grand scheme of things, having any story at all in a tower defense game is something of a luxury. The disappointment is the result of an expectation created by the surprising emotional depth in the first game’s monologue from your AI sidekick, General Fletcher, who was both brilliantly written and voice-acted with heart. Fletcher returns in Defense Grid 2, but the script is almost entirely forgettable and some of the voice acting from some of the cast of new characters - particularly Commander Simon - is just eye-rollingly bad. Finally, there’s multiplayer, which sadly doesn’t add anything good to Defense Grid 2. I had some brief fun with the competitive mode, which transports aliens your towers kill to your opponent’s map at the same corresponding spot where they died, but it’s too chaotic and unpredictable, and lacks the ability to rewind or change the speed of time. The two co-op multiplayer modes are just annoying. First of all, you can’t step back or speed up time because it’s multiplayer, so it’s both slow and crippled compared to the single-player experience. Second, you’re both pulling from the same resource pool, so unless you’re both totally on the same wavelength the whole time, you can have your partner spend the resources you were saving up for a big tower upgrade, and there’s no way to undo except sell the tower at a loss. It’s silly. Defense Grid 2’s new variations on the original’s excellent tower defense gameplay pulled me right back into the compulsively addictive quest to destroy all aliens with a minimum of expenditure. I don’t recommend the multiplayer and the story doesn’t even compare to the standard set by the original, but its 20 maps absolutely scratch that same itch – and provide lots of tools to keep that momentum going for a long while.
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/09/nba-2k15-review	 NBA 2K15 steps onto the court as the reigning champion of basketball sims, but it’s a champion with an asterisk next to its name due to the extended server debacle of last year. Some of those online issues are repeated this year, which cripples some of NBA 2K15’s coolest features. But thanks to some good tweaks and the outstanding MyCareer mode, it’s still a game I can recommend as a strong offline basketball game.  This game is drop-dead gorgeous. Running at a smooth 60 frames per second, the seamless player animations really make it feel almost as authentic as the real thing. Just like in the real NBA, Tim Duncan will hug the ball before each game, Dwayne Wade will do pull ups on the rim, and Kobe will complain when he thinks he got fouled. 2K has paid great attention to detail, and it pays off. 2K15 reuses last year’s excellent TV broadcast-style presentation and heavy use of slow motion, and it looks just as stunning. That wasn’t broken, so it’s good that it wasn’t fixed. However, there’s one sloppy oversight so glaring it’s hard not to laugh at: in the real world, Steve Kerr is now the Head Coach for the Golden State Warriors, and that’s reflected in-game. However, 2K15 re-uses his voice commentary from last year anyway. It’s a bit odd to hear him talking about the game one second and then seeing bizarro Steve Kerr roaming the sideline the next. In the win column, a new pre-game segment featuring Ernie Johnson and Shaquille O’Neal does a surprisingly great job of distracting from the long load times with some entertaining contextualized commentary. Another addition is an in-game, live-action show called NBA 2KTV, which 2K says will be updated weekly to feature player interviews, behind-the-scenes videos, tips from the developer, and even Virtual Currency giveaways. This is front and center on the sleek looking and easy-to-use main menu, though it can get pretty annoying because it restarts every time you return there. On the court, NBA 2K’s core basketball gameplay is as strong as ever, with only slight adjustments from last year. Running the pick-and-roll or even the newly added triangle offense just feels so right, especially with the changes made to the defensive AI that make it more aggressive in stealing the ball from you. And including a shot meter was a brilliant idea - it gives me simple and immediate feedback, explaining exactly why I just missed an open jumper.  I’m sad to say that online franchise mode is an afterthought in NBA 2K15. It’s missing meaningful options, such as simple free agency. Conversely, the single-player franchise mode, MyGM, received a lot of love. There are almost no microtransactions (good riddance), the conversation system has been improved to give you more than just yes or no answers, and you can now earn XP even when you sim, which let me zip through a rewarding season as a manager without feeling cheated out of progress when I didn’t want to play full games. The star of NBA 2K15 is MyCareer mode, which has been completely upgraded in nearly every way. The brand-new story has your player go undrafted, rather than being a top pick, and having to earn my way onto the roster was a fresh and welcomed change. The way you upgrade your MyPlayer is more streamlined, too, so there’s much less busywork involved. Rather than micromanaging each individual attribute, skill sets are now grouped together into categories, like Defense and Athleticism. One of the most impressive things about the new MyCareer mode is that the veteran teammate that takes you under his wing finally found his voice. 2K Sports got a real NBA player from each team to actually speak for their game character, like Steph Curry for the Warriors and Demarcus Cousins for the Kings. They’re obviously not voice actors, but it still makes a huge difference to the overall experience.  2K15 also uses the PlayStation Camera or Xbox One Kinect to digitally map your face onto your MyPlayer, with hilariously ugly results. And, when I finally got a good scan, a server hiccup erased my face. It’s a fun thing to do at parties, but I wouldn’t want these monstrosities in my game. But again, the 2K servers have completely destroyed several online modes. MyPark, the game mode where you take your MyPlayer onto the blacktop, is broken, despite splitting players between three separate communities. Crippling lag makes defense a guessing game, and that’s only if you can stay connected. When it does work, however, you can join and create crews with your friends, and even venture into the Jordan Rec Center to play full- length games with NBA rules. MyTeam, the card collecting game, is also crippled. It’s too bad, because it’s full of additional content this year, with numerous single-player challenges that force you to think outside of the box. But the cumbersome UI just confused me, since the overall player ratings were nowhere to be found. NBA 2K15 feels like a new-gen experience that 2K isn’t quite ready for. It’s an absolutely beautiful game to look at, and its controls are as tight as they’ve ever been. Some features are vastly improved from last year, and fortunately most of those continue to work when the servers don’t. It’s a shame that the best game modes won’t always be accessible, because this could’ve been an amazing basketball game. It still could be, if 2K can fix it. But if you buy it right now, you can expect a great offline experience.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review	 Many open-world, non-linear drive-and-gun games -- with some notable exclusions -- tend to tack on a story merely to loosely justify whatever it is you're doing. But the main thing I made clear in my original review of Sleeping Dogs on Xbox 360 and PS3 back in 2012 is that while it's a blast to play, its story is actually the star of the show. The Definitive Edition for new-gen consoles carries over both of those great traits and adds a decent facelift, and it's just as fun and just as memorable as it was the first time around. An engaging plot littered with memorable characters and a ton of slowly building tension is artfully coupled with solid melee action, gunplay, and driving to create a multi-faceted game that satisfies on all fronts. As far as the aesthetic is concerned, Sleeping Dogs was never an exceptionally pretty game, but The Definitive Edition resolves some of its biggest visual faults and brings it more in line with the PC version. On the Xbox One version I played, draw distances are vastly extended, textures are much sharper, and the overall gloss of the entire convincing recreation of Hong Kong is improved. It doesn't look like a native new-gen game by any stretch of the imagination, however - and it’s disappointing that the framerate stutters a bit when you're on foot running around and exploring, and the camera is still a bit messy in certain circumstances. Again, though, I have to sing the praises of the story. Sleeping Dogs revolves around an undercover Hong Kong detective named Wei Shen. Shen – who's voiced wonderfully by Will Yun Lee in both English and Cantonese, is an interesting protagonist, one with true depth. Shen’s embedded himself with the Hong Kong underworld in order to unravel it from within, and watching him get sucked further and further into peril is fascinating. He's not a nameless hero or a loosely constructed anyman. He seems as real as a character in a movie. Of course, Sleeping Dogs has plenty for you if story isn't your thing. Its driving mechanics are on-point, with lots of different vehicles toting unique feels, from run-down motorcycles and hulking industrial trucks to supped-up sedans and expensive sports cars, and everything in between. Developer United Front Games has crafted a believable and incredibly busy version of Hong Kong that's simply a blast to drive around, explore, and uncover. Likewise, fighting -- whether with your fists, a melee weapon, or a firearm -- is also a lot of fun. There's a ton of collectibles to discover in addition to its meaty campaign, with tons of offshoot side quests to complete. In short, Sleeping Dogs is bound to keep you very busy not only when keeping up with its story, but in simply doing everything within it there is to do.  Content-wise, the only notable difference between the old-gen version of Sleeping Dogs and the Definitive Edition is the inclusion of DLC. Both the supernatural-themed Nightmare in North Point and the cop-centric Year of the Snake are included, though I wasn't blown away by either. These separate packs -- which feel disjointed and aren't a part of the campaign -- don't stack up with the likes of GTA IV’s The Lost and the Damned or The Ballad of Gay Tony in terms of the amount of content, the quality of the new characters, or even new objectives. But, it's pretty cool that they're here in case you want to mess with them. Testing out Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition reminded me of a facet I hadn't thought much about since I last played it in 2012: its multi-tiered leveling system. This experience rubric provides Shen with rewards in three different categories: as a cop, as a member of the criminal Triad, and as a citizen of Hong Kong. Earning experience points in these three categories often conflicts with one another, and each category has unique skills associated with it. Delving into this system is a ton of fun, and it's really cool watching Shen get stronger based on how I chose to behave. Displaying disregard for the citizens of Hong Kong won't net you much love in your Face meter, for instance, but upholding the law will surely bring you plenty of cop experience points. Back in 2012, I called Sleeping Dogs one of the biggest -- and most pleasant -- surprises of the year. Two years later, the surprise has obviously dissipated, but that doesn't take away from what United Front Games achieved here. Playing the Definitive Edition reminded me how much I enjoyed its excellent story and characters, combat, and city, but also made me pine for a true new-gen sequel. The differences here might not be worth paying for a second time, but if you missed out on this great open-world action game the first time, you shouldn’t repeat that mistake.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/project-spark-review	 As I was learning my way around Project Spark, a passerby told me, “that looks like work.” Sometimes, I felt that way too. This is a game about making games, and it functions comparably to game engines such as Unreal or Unity. It can be complicated, tedious, and frustrating -- but the reward for overcoming the challenges of creation is having something your friends, family, and the world can play. This, above all else, makes something that’s already smart and fun even more exciting.  The part of Project Spark that functions like an actual game is an episodic single-player campaign that demonstrates what’s possible, as well as how you can create useful and fun logic for characters and objects. It’s a helpful first step, but it isn’t enough to guide you to make something whole. Plus, its 3D action game simplicity isn’t terribly enjoyable on its own. But at any point, if you own the objects Project Spark sells piecemeal, you can stop playing and start editing right then and there to figure out how something operates.  Everything in Project Spark has a Brain, in which you can modify how an object responds when something happens to it. I’m a game design daydreamer with no formal training, so navigating complicated menus to create artificial intelligence behaviors is terrifying, and getting them to work can be challenging, even in spite of its helpful visual scripting. But it’s interesting, satisfying, and really fun to design a space from scratch, populate it with people, and see them respond to a player character with dialogue you wrote, or a big event you scripted. It feels good to make something. It feels better when someone says it’s cool. Project Spark is a sandbox and a playground for your creativity, and it’s relatively easy to jump in and start creating. It’s also really, really hard to make something that isn’t awful. The tools tend to result in a lot of similar, generic, and unremarkable action games. The level of depth permits stronger, more thoughtful games, but it’ll take the community time to dig beneath the surface to achieve something truly great. That all of those tools are available for free is amazing. Project Spark’s $40 starter set gives you a ton of new props for visual variety, and the DLC packs have even more, but everything you need to make something is available for free. Understanding these systems takes time and effort, but Project Spark is reasonably accessible. Because Spark’s tutorials only scratch the surface of what it can do, I relied heavily on YouTube videos to tell me how to use a boolean variable, or what an object’s vector means. Now they’re core to the kinds of games I’m making with friends -- and making games with friends is where Project Spark becomes something truly special. Cooperative design is easily the best thing about Project Spark. I enjoyed my time alone, tinkering with 2D platformers and 3D action games, but having someone else to help make your game design dreams come true is legitimately among my favorite game experience in a while. While my friend created an interactive sequence later in our 2D platformer level, I decorated an early scene with new lighting, visual effects, and props. He, the designer, me, the artist. In another game, I used Project Spark’s flexible tools to create walls, paths, and visual cues. That’s level design. Meanwhile, he was making a non-playable character respond to player interactions using the Brain editor’s visual programming. We argued about what was best for the game versus what was best for the player. We solved problems together, and he cleaned up my messes. This isn’t exactly like being a development team -- but like Rock Band is awesome for wannabe rockstars, Project Spark is a terrific approximation of what it might be like to work at a video game studio. Here, though, you actually create something you can share, and doing it together is as good as Project Spark gets. It’s still very early in its life, so right now most of what Project Spark’s community has made is...lacking in quality, to say the least. People are still learning what’s possible though, and I found myself giving high ratings to games that accomplished novel things I didn’t know how to do, rather than games I actually thought were good. There’s potential here, even if most of the action games are garbage Fable clones, or straight-up remakes of other games. But imitation is a helpful way to learn. To be fair, my games are simple, pointless, or too limited to be good. I have not made anything I’m comfortable sharing publicly, and I’m not sure I ever will. But what I have is a small collection of things representing my growth as a creator. I’m proud of what I’ve made -- even though you’d probably hate it. If you spend time with Project Spark, you might appreciate my cool cave-in sequence, or the fixed camera right behind my main character. Maybe you’ll make something you’ve always dreamed of, or learn from my mistakes. Project Spark is a commitment, and a huge time investment to really make something substantial. It’s also a worthwhile endeavor for anyone who’s ever wished to make games. Learning the obtuse and complicated systems is surprisingly enjoyable, because you’ll see satisfying results instantly when you conquer a problem. So far, there are few games I’d actually recommend playing on the Project Spark marketplace, but the engine itself is an enormous amount of fun to use. It’s rich with possibility, primed for your creativity, and capable of bringing your imagination to life.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	 Thanks to a slick opening that includes nostalgic narration and busted-tracking-on-the-VCR visual effects, the first five minutes of Alien: Isolation are far and away better than any piece of last year’s dreadfully disappointing Aliens: Colonial Marines. But by the end of the 15 to 20 (!) hours I spent with the mano-y-xenomorph survival horror show, I wish I’d stopped after the first half-dozen. That’s not to say Isolation is anywhere near as bad as Colonial Marines, but its crime is equally egregious: it is a great idea that, in practice, not only wears out its welcome, but drags on so long that it almost completely erases any trace of the fun I once had. Which is a whole different form of horror than I was expecting. Isolation impresses out of the gate not only due to the aforementioned intro, but because its art direction and sound design dutifully nail the vibe of Ridley Scott’s original 1979 film. I can’t stress this enough. From the DOS-based “futuristic” computers and their scan-lined CRT monitors to the fear-enhancing, violin-screeched orchestral score, Isolation clearly did its homework in the A/V department. My favorite aspect of the presentation is the atmospheric use of fog. From wisps of smoke that billow out of air vents to clouds of white mist that obscure your vision when you rewire an area’s life-support systems in order to aid your stealthy objectives, Isolation certainly looks and sounds like a part of the Alien universe.  Considering this is a survival horror game, it takes a bit longer than I expected for the alien to show up and cause trouble. I wrote off not feeling threatened for the first hour, though, because it seemed only fair to give Isolation time to lay a foundation and establish its setting, tone, premise, and characters. Amanda is likable, with a clearly defined tough-as-nails personality befitting of her mother, Signorney Weaver’s Ellen Ripley. Once the xenomorph does start stalking you through the dark and creepy Sevastopol space station, Isolation hits its stride. It is an absolutely stressful game to play – by design. About 99% of your hunter’s movements and actions are unscripted, so you genuinely never know if it’s going to leave you alone for minutes at a time, crawl into the ventilation ducts in the ceiling and then immediately drop back down, or sniff around the room you’re hiding in for three minutes, forcing you to wait it out. The slightest sound, light source, or sight of you will cause the serial-murdering lifeform to charge and kill you. It’s impervious to your weapons – be they a pistol, shotgun, flamethrower, or crafted items such as Molotov cocktails and pipe bombs. In fact, only the latter three of these can even annoy the alien enough to force it to temporarily leave the area. A slower, quieter crouched walk from locker to storage cabinet to under a desk is often the safest method of progression, but as you’ll come to learn, the alien’s unpredictability is both Isolation’s greatest strength as well as its most crippling weakness. The typical encounter in Isolation goes like this: you get a warning pulse from your painstakingly recreated motion tracker, hear the unsettling sound of the alien spawning into the area as it drops in from an overhead air duct. You hide in a locker, storage cabinet, or under a desk, stare at your motion tracker until the creature completely leaves the area, and then you proceed as quietly as possible toward your next objective. And for the first several hours of gameplay, that formula works to tense, satisfying effect. Yes, you’ll die – a lot, if you’re like me – but during this honeymoon period, Isolation effectively keeps the pressure on. Manually activated, wall-mounted telephones are the only way to save your progress, so reaching the next one genuinely feels like a miniature victory unto itself, and getting impaled by the alien before you can pick up the receiver is a dramatic defeat. The clomping of the alien’s footsteps, the bassy whump of it skittering around in the air vents above you, its angry shrieks and hisses, having to lean back and hold your breath as it sniffs for you while you’re hiding in a locker, inches away from its acidic spittle – they all make Isolation very good at ensuring that you’re never comfortable while trying to get the hell off the Sevastopol. A handful of timed hacking minigames you must complete while the creature can be lurking anywhere are also high points of fear.  Unfortunately, the campaign mirrors the Sevastopol itself: the longer it drags on, the more it falls apart as it begins to tumble out of orbit and towards a gas giant. Ripley’s nightmare became my own as Isolation moved its goalposts back so many damn times that it was almost comical. First is an oddly extended, alien-free stretch midway through that pits you against aggro androids instead of organic terrors. Mercifully, the bots can be killed, but not without well-placed headshots from firearms that are cumbersome to reload. That, and the scares disappear without the singularly lethal force stalking you. This is not a first-person shooter, though it occasionally pretends to be. Worse, I strongly believed that Isolation was ending on at least two separate occasions, with the second of those times even seeing the resolution of Ripley’s original motivation: to get some sort of lead or closure on her missing mother. It turned out I wasn’t even close – I had another few hours to go, but now without any real reason behind it. Your objective is a final-sounding “Escape the station” for a good eight hours or so, but with so many errands to do along the way – not to mention the incessant and irritating backtracking across the entire ship – Isolation falls into a pit of frustrating repetition from which it cannot escape.  Rather than throw a new gameplay twist at you, Isolation, like so many games before it, simply spends hours making you run a fun-less gauntlet and contend with everything it’s thrown at you so far simultaneously, including human, android, and extraterrestrial foes. Fright dissolved into frustration as I got killed from behind for the umpteenth time – even as I was crouched motionless and out of sight in an air duct. The survival-horror joy found in the campaign’s early hours is completely and permanently erased. Even when you finally – finally! – reach the end, it’s an underwhelming conclusion that doesn’t adequately pay off the 15-20 hours you just survived. And in hindsight, playing on Hard difficulty – which I only did because Isolation actually describes it as “the recommended way to experience the game” – was a terrible decision. It means the Xenomorph can get you anywhere at any time, giving you no opportunity to avoid death, and run you down if it hears so much as a pin drop. Sure, a flamethrower blast or Molotov cocktail can ward it off for a moment, but alien-repelling resources are extremely scarce. Don’t make the same mistake I did.  As a footnote, Isolation offers a leaderboard-based Survival Mode that challenges you to complete various scenarios with the highest score, earned by posting the fastest times and completing bonus objectives. It recommends that you not try it until you’ve completed the campaign, but after a protracted marathon, I didn’t even want to look at it. (I did, though, to be able to tell you for sure that it wasn’t worth it.) Alien: Isolation seemed like the perfect Alien game on paper, and for the first handful of hours it even seems to deliver on its promise on the strength of its outstanding art and sound that faithfully recreates the ambiance of the classic horror film. Instead, what was the Great Xenomorphic Hope ends in another disappointment for a license loaded with interactive-entertainment potential. It’s a shame that Isolation doesn’t track stats, because I’d be curious to know how many of its roughly 15-20 hours I spent hiding in lockers, staring at the motion tracker, and, most of all, how many hundreds (yes, hundreds) of times I died without a chance to save myself. It may seem strange to complain that a game’s too long, but when the genuine scares of being hunted by an unstoppable predator are so diluted by repetition and padding, Isolation’s epic length really does work against it. Someday, someone is going to make an incredible Alien video game that checks every box. But, sadly, Isolation is not it.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	" The best thing about playing Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor is that it makes me feel over-the-top powerful without sacrificing the fear of defeat. It’s got great free-flowing combat and a good-sized, good-looking open world full of Lord of the Rings lore to find, but what makes it special is what’s going on in the background: an intriguing hierarchy of enemies that gives every victory and defeat extra meaning.  A brief and shocking opening scene sets a dark and brutal tone as Talion, a former Ranger of Gondor, is ritually executed along with his family. Talion’s spirit is then bound to an amnesiac elf ghost and returned to Middle-earth for vengeance against Sauron’s forces. It’s a story that doesn’t make total sense for hardcore Tolkien scholars, but it’s well-acted. It makes decent use of Gollum, and there are a couple of memorable new characters - particularly Ratbag the comic-relief uruk, who guides you through the process of infiltrating the enemy army. My interest in the plot dwindled toward the end, but it does a fair job of explaining why Talion has such sweet supernatural powers with his sword, dagger, and bow. Much like in the Batman: Arkham games, you can choose to stealthily pick off enemies one at a time, or dive head-first into a brawl with dozens of opponents and beat the crap out of them with a smoothly animated series of attacks and counters. Unlike Batman, of course, Mordor’s involve great, gory decapitation and stabbing animations, and outside of the scripted story missions, there are few distinctly separated stealth and combat areas. It’s enticingly freeform. Acrobatically slaughtering Sauron’s ugly minions feels as easy as it appears to be for Legolas in Peter Jackson’s movies, and it’s more fun to do than to watch. Sword combat feels pretty much just as good here as brawling does in Batman – which is to say it’s amazing. Mordor’s take on building up hit streaks to power up lethal takedowns is a bit more forgiving, in that you’re almost never locked into an animation. If you push the counter button, Talion will drop what he’s doing and counter instantly. It’s extremely responsive. A time-slowing power makes scoring a couple of headshots with the bow easy, whether in stealth or in the heat of battle, though it’s kept in check by ammo constraints and a limited (but upgradable) supply of time-slowing juice. And even though stealth gameplay is pretty basic, it’s great to have the option to thin the herd a bit before they know you’re there.  What really sets the feel of Mordor’s combat apart from the Batman games is that it’s really easy to get into trouble, especially early on. If you let the uruks raise the alarm in one of their strongholds, or just happen across a few large wandering groups on the densely populated map, you can quickly become overwhelmed by more enemies than you can hope to handle. Picking out the shield bearers and ax-wielding berserkers who are immune to frontal attacks and killing them first becomes tough to do when you’re completely surrounded, and it goes downhill from there. Health doesn’t recharge much on its own, and until you can upgrade your health pool, you may find yourself succumbing to death by a thousand pinpricks if you don’t retreat. Things got a lot easier a few hours in when I’d leveled up and unlocked more of Talion’s skill tree so that I could build up combos quicker, execute two enemies for the price of one, and even fight mounted on a huge, rancor-like graug who pops uruks into his mouth like jellybeans. It feels powerful, but I still don’t feel invincible even with everything nearly maxed out.  And what’s really cool about Mordor is that whether you win or lose a fight, something interesting happens. If you kill an uruk captain, he drops a rune that can be slotted into one of your weapons for bonuses. Some of them changed the way I played, like the legendary rune that extended the amount of time I have to score another hit before my combo count resets by 10 seconds, and one that made me immune to poison attacks. If any uruk kills you, even if he’s a random grunt, he levels up and earns new abilities and some cooler armor. Maybe he gets promoted up the chain of command. You’ll definitely run into him again later to settle the score, and he’ll have a new introduction taunt about his victory when you meet. It makes each death feel meaningful. Most uruk captains do tend to die too quickly to really become memorable, but some definitely did. (Sometimes they’ll survive being apparently killed by you and come back with a scarred face.) For that reason, and to identify the arrival of a significant threat, I never really got tired of the action-pausing cutscenes that play when a captain shows up. There are enough different voices and multiple possible lines that I rarely saw repeats, and the uruk faces are surprisingly well animated and expressive.  Even though the hierarchy is a pretty simple system when you understand what it’s doing, and realize that these uruk captains aren’t actually roaming the map in real time, it’s great to play with. Uruks have an internal power struggle for rank, and you can interrupt their duels, feasts, hunts, and more to pick fights and kill off Uruk captains and ultimately the powerful Warchiefs. Each captain has his own randomized strengths and vulnerabilities, so every fight is at least a little different. I ran into a couple of guys who seemed invulnerable to almost everything, which was a little annoying – one fight took me about 15 minutes of repeatedly chasing down a captain who was invulnerable to my sword and dagger and filling him with arrows trying to damage him faster than his health regenerated. Eventually, though, they all went down. In the second act, you transition from the bleak, brown map to a refreshingly greener-looking area of Mordor. There, Talion and his elf-ghost buddy suddenly realize he can mind-control uruks and turn them against each other. (It feels like something might’ve been cut out there.) That’s even more fun, because the ability to “brand” an enemy gives you the choice of either killing a captain for a rune reward or controlling him and siccing him on one of his former allies. Taking an uruk alive can be trickier than lopping off his head, though, so it’s more challenging to accomplish the new goal of mind-controlling five Warchiefs. I love how you have the option to mind-control a Warchief’s lieutenants, then kill the Warchief, to watch your minion become the new Warchief. I did notice that the mind-control visual effect caused some slowdown on the PlayStation 4 version (the Xbox One version has yet to arrive for testing), but it didn’t interfere much with combat. Charging through the decent but less-exciting story missions would probably take around 12 hours, but the goal of killing or dominating the Warchiefs is much more time-consuming and interesting. I spent around 25 hours to reach the end, and there’s still a lot of challenging side missions based around testing sword, bow, and dagger skills left to do. And, of course, lots of collectables and wildlife-hunting challenges. 6GB? Now THOSE are textures! On the PC side Mordor also compares to the Batman games, in that it’s of good quality. There are even some enhanced graphics settings, including an ultra-high texture setting that requires a full 6GB of video memory. My only issue with it is some awkward menu controls, but most of those are customizable and those that aren’t aren’t too inconvenient to get used to.   Xbox One Version - September 30, 2014  After a day with Shadow of Mordor on Xbox One, I can confidently recommend it just as strongly as the PS4 and PC versions. True, this is probably the worst-looking of the bunch by a small margin - the PS4 runs at a slightly higher resolution and the PC has better lighting than either (and all the resolution your hardware can handle) - but it performs at roughly the same clip as the PS4 version and provides effectively the same experience. That means what appears to our eyes to be a framerate that fluctuates somewhere between 30 and 60, excluding occasional slowdowns when ""combat-branding"" an uruk in the midst of a large group of enemies. If you have an Xbox One, there's no reason to avoid this version. Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor stands out from other open-world action games by putting a great new layer on top of the trail that Batman blazed. I was surprised at how well it integrates its excellent combat with rewarding feedback and progression not just for me, but also for my enemies. I’ve had many more memorable and unpredictable battles with its randomized Warchiefs and captains than I did in the scripted campaign missions, and I expect those to keep on coming."
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/forza-horizon-2-review	 Forza Horizon 2’s greatest moments sometimes come under the most unexpected circumstances. The Land Rover Defender isn’t exactly known for its speed or sportiness, and Tchaikovsky isn’t renowned for his racing game soundtrack contributions, but when Horizon 2 mashes these things together something very, very good happens. I’ve played a lot of racing games over the past two-or-so decades. I’ve never played one where I was shredding through a vineyard at top speed in an agricultural 4X4 primarily designed to effectively ferry British farmers up wet hills. Certainly not with the 1812 Overture booming from the stereo. Is it slightly absurd? Yes. Is it fun? Absolutely. Vineyards, and fences, and cafes. And, well, anywhere really. Forza Horizon 2 rebottles the winning formula established by its predecessor, albeit with a heaped tablespoon of new and improved ingredients. The eclectic roster of 200+ lavishly detailed cars here ranges from cult coupes to hypercars, and it’s the best line-up in the open-world racing business. Like Horizon before it, they all feel distinct from one another too, thanks to the Forza series’ familiar, top-quality driving dynamics. As usual, supercars feel crisp and sharp, SUVs feel suitably soggy, and everything seems honed to let you heave your cars into corners with two glorious fistfuls of opposite lock. What developer Playground Games has added, however, is a far richer world that’s exponentially denser with rewarding racing and exploration content. The backdrop this time is a slab of land straddling the border of northern Italy and the south of France. It’s wish-fulfilment for Forza fans who’ve spent the last decade watching the hosts of Top Gear cocking about on the Mediterranean coastline every second week. It’s a bigger area than Forza Horizon’s small slice of Colorado, though it’s not a 1:1 recreation of the region. It’s still dwarfed by the likes of Test Drive Unlimited’s life-size Oahu, but there’s a lot more to do in it. The airstrip, shipping port, and abandoned freight yard are highlights, each offering drift-friendly, hoon-tuned playgrounds to experiment in between races. These are great places to compulsively rack up your Skill points. These rewards for impressive driving return from the original, although this time they’re integrated far better into the gameplay. Where previously Skills points had a nebulous effect on your ‘popularity’, in Horizon 2 they unlock points you can trade for permanent perks like discounts on new cars or a small grace period at the beginning of an online game of Horizon 2’s tag mode, ‘Infected’. Accumulating huge skill combos in Horizon 2 is a lot of fun and far more satisfying now that there’s more reason to do so. Nice hog. The game’s 700-or-so events are also lucrative sources of Skill points, from the highly enjoyable Showcase races to class-based blasts across the countryside. The ability to plough through shrubs, splinter fences, and drive almost anywhere is a big shift in Horizon 2. While many events take place on pre-determined ribbons of road, plenty of Horizon 2’s racing is on the rolling fields and through the scattered forests of Tuscany and Provence. The fast and frantic new cross-country races are probably my favourite race types. Low-slung sport cars cope unrealistically well with off-road excursions but it’s a forgivable concession to reality considering how much fun these races are. Horizon 2’s racing is supplemented by plenty of extracurricular activities. The new Bucket List challenges are the best; they’re unique activities to complete in cars parked around the world. Some are a little plain, like a simple speed trap goal, but some are hugely enjoyable, like a stunt challenge around a golf course. Barn Finds are back too, tucked away across the region, and Playground made good on its promise that half of them would be brand new cars for the Forza franchise. If you followed the team’s weekly car reveals over the previous months the silhouettes on the Barn Find interface will probably give most of the surprises away, but I still loved uncovering the worn-out, weed-filled wrecks and seeing them restored to showroom condition. One thing I particularly enjoy about Horizon 2 is how you’re welcome to completely ignore the car championships the game suggests to you on your way to the ‘Horizon Finale’ and select your own favourites. Letting us meaningfully progress the game by remaining in the cars we prefer, rather than forcing us into vehicles we’re not in the mood to race, is great design. Because red is always the correct colour. You’re also only ever a button press from being online, too. It works well, syncing your time of day to an online session and seamlessly transitioning you into it. The online racing was steady during testing, and I like that being rewarded for building Skill point combos keeps things worthwhile for those of us who can’t always finish first, but the more gentlemanly single-player remains my preferred environment. That, or the fiendishly addictive Rivals component where I can compete with my mates’ event records asynchronously. I lost an entire late night session trading times back and forth with a friend on just one of Horizon 2’s marquee Showcase races. Like Forza Motorsport 5, Forza Horizon 2 uses AI driver profiles from your friends list to populate your career races during single-player, as well as the world itself, removing the need for a generic gallery of trash-talking Euro jocks to function as opponents. Horizon 2 is generally better for it but it’s still too insistent on having us choose a design to immediately apply to the cars we buy. The result is a cavalcade of clipart-splattered cars cruising down the French Riviera looking far more like the kind of off-brand Hot Wheels you’d see lining the pegs at Toys “R” Us than sexy, six-figure supercars. You can still opt out for your own cars but there’s no option to explicitly disable these user designs on opponents, like you can in Forza Motorsport 5, and this irritatingly spoils the game’s aesthetics somewhat. The cars I want to see in my game are the sleek, unadulterated machines we see utilised in Horizon 2’s intro; not gaudy eyesores spackled in ostentatious graphics. It'd be great to be able to disable the so-called Drivatar designs. It’s kind of a shame too, because virtually everywhere else, Horizon 2 has grown up quite a bit from the first. The menu overlays are more sophisticated, there are no microtransaction options muddying the economy, and Horizon’s layer of men’s lifestyle product promotion has been given the boot. So long, Old Spice US Muscle Mash! The world itself is gorgeous, from the vast fields of red poppies to the scooter-lined streets of Nice. While some of the shadows seem a little choppy, the resolutely locked framerate never wavers and thus delivers a dependable, smooth driving experience. As stunning as Horizon 2 looks during the day, it looks even better at night. All light sources in Horizon 2 are rendered in real-time; headlights slice through the inky blackness and smashing a street lamp realistically darkens areas it was previously bathing in light. From the right vantage points, the soft glow of the fireworks and spinning amusement rides at the Horizon festival can be seen from miles away. Horizon 2’s new wet weather effects are easy on the eyes too. I love the way the world is reflected back at us via puddles on the asphalt, although the spray effect on vehicles is more static than I’d anticipated; even at speed the droplets don’t streak across the windscreen or bonnet. The sound is as good as we’ve come to expect from the Forza series, with roaring engines and crackling exhaust overrun best enjoyed in any one of Horizon 2’s lengthy tunnels. I especially love the pleasing crunch of gravel beneath the tyres, but the tyre noise slider needs to be cranked up to 10 rather than its default setting. The first Forza Horizon set a new standard for open-world racing games, and Forza Horizon 2 has comprehensively updated that standard. The location is right, the car list extensive, the handling nuanced but accessible, and the visuals are excellent. Above everything it’s always fun, whether you’re in a ludicrous Land Rover race or sniffing out a hidden Barn Find. Forza Horizon 2 is Test Drive Unlimited, PGR, Smuggler’s Run, and Forza Motorsport all crammed into a T-shirt cannon and fired into your face. It wears its inspiration on its sleeves but damn if that’s not a killer combination.
Miranda Sanchez	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/24/dance-central-spotlight-review	 As I raised my hand to initiate the count for OneRepublic’s Counting Stars, my cat pounced on my ankles and attacked my feet. I don’t blame her; my dance skills are awful. However, Dance Central Spotlight helped me become a little less awful. Hundreds of dance moves and smooth difficulty progression make Dance Central Spotlight a fun way to learn new dance techniques and work out. However, it does miss out on features from past Dance Central games, giving it a stripped down feel by comparison.  Dance Central Spotlight brings the dance series down to its bare bones. Unlike its predecessors, it doesn’t include a story mode or competitive multiplayer. What’s more, if you’re looking for a bit of variety in your music, you’re going to have to buy it because the 10 pre-loaded songs are limited to recent Top 40 hits, such as Happy by Pharrell Williams and Diamonds by Rihanna. In essence, at $10 USD for the base game, Dance Central Spotlight functions as a platform within which you create your own experience through DLC. There’s currently 50 songs available for $2 USD each, or a few dollars more for certain song packs. Despite that though, I never felt short-changed. Each of the 10 songs has eight routines -- Beginner, Standard, Deluxe, Pro, Alternate, Cardio, Strength, and Alternate Pro -- so there’s still a lot of content to get through. Each song starts you off with the Beginner routine, but once you collect enough dance cards by earning a “Flawless” rating on dance moves, you’ll begin to unlock the other routines. Dance Central Spotlight doesn’t have a fail state, so having the collection barrier feels like an appropriate way to pace players into the more difficult routines. Jumping from Beginner to Standard to Deluxe was smooth, as each difficulty felt like it added just the right number of moves to keep it challenging and entertaining. The practice mode accessed by saying “Hey DJ, practice that,” or by pressing the Y button is thankfully still available. In this mode, you can practice a specific dance move at its normal speed or slow it down. It helped me on several occasions when I needed to nail down complicated moves to unlock the next routine. The Xbox One’s Kinect tracks your movements down to a tee, so precision in your moves is key, which is great. I couldn’t be lazy and slack through songs if I wanted to collect enough cards to move on. Instead, I had to really learn each move, which not only made me a better dancer, but also helped prepare me for the more challenging routines ahead.  The Fitness mode in Dance Central Spotlight sees the most improvements over past games. Instead of building up a playlist of songs, you choose how long you’d like to dance -- sometime between 10 and 90 minutes -- and then you can select which kinds of routines you’d like perform. Once started, the mode picks random songs from your library and alternates between showing the time of your workout and your estimated calories burned. With the new Cardio and Strength routines, I felt like I got the most out of my time in the Fitness mode since their dance moves are specialized for working out. Not only does Dance Central Spotlight lack competitive multiplayer, but it actually reduces the number of local co-op players from Dance Central 3’s eight back down to two. That doesn’t keep it from being fun though. To start a co-op game, players have to high-five -- what better way to get pumped for a routine than to start your game with a high-five? Jumping in and out of co-op is totally seamless too. If a player leaves or re-enters the Kinect’s field of vision, the song will just keep going while the camera focuses accordingly, all without interrupting the routine. This improved co-op functionality is great, but it’s a shame that Dance Central Spotlight doesn’t capitalize on this with a new online mode or by at least maintaining multiplayer features from past games.  Dance Central Spotlight takes advantage of Kinect 2.0 to better identify players’ movements and creates a more seamless co-op experience. Though it feels like it moves a step back in the series’ multiplayer potential, the hundreds of dance moves, great progression between difficulties, and the more realized Fitness mode pick up the slack.
Chris Schilling	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/fifa-15-ps4xbox-one-review	 A single moment can say a great deal about a game’s design philosophy. For me, that moment came in a game between me (as Man City) and the CPU (as Chelsea). Pablo Zabaleta won the ball with a crunching challenge on Eden Hazard; the Belgian hit the deck, with Zabaleta about to stride onto the loose ball, and into acres of space. Meanwhile, his fellow Argentine Sergio Aguero, anticipating an unfolding counter-attack, accelerated into a sprint. But instead of running forward as I squeezed the right trigger, Zabaleta suddenly held both hands up, as if to say 'no foul'. By the time the player responded to my prompt, Nemanja Matic had seized upon the opportunity, intercepting the ball and launching another Chelsea sortie. It’s an example of FIFA 15’s much-touted ‘emotional intelligence’, a feature designed to make each player respond authentically to any given scenario. Yet emotions tend to overrule the rational part of our brains, and the same applies here; what it ultimately means for FIFA is that you’ll see players make more mistakes under pressure. In theory, it’s a fine idea, but the execution is problematic, because to compensate for human error, EA Sports has made them less fallible elsewhere. The result is that AI behaviour oscillates between smart and stupid. Nowhere is this more apparent than with goalkeepers. They’ve been noticeably refined, and for the most part this turns them into truly great shot-stoppers. They’ll now react to deviations in the ball’s flight path, twisting their bodies in mid-air when it takes a deflection off a lunging defender’s knee, jabbing out a leg to turn aside a shot that seems to be squirming past them, and sticking out gloves to palm aside rebounds on the rare occasions the ball falls kindly to your striker. (It’s more common to see a parry picked up by an AI forward, of course.) Unlike last year’s game, you won’t see them hurl themselves full length to the right of their goal as the ball trickles into the bottom left-hand corner. This is undoubtedly a good thing.  But on the other hand, they’re often comically panicky in goalmouth scrambles, and alarmingly prone to letting daisy-cutters through their legs. During a thumping early win with my Ultimate Team, I nutmegged the keeper for four of my goals. In another game, I saw Joe Hart suddenly sprint out of his goalmouth as if called forward for an injury-time corner. Which would have been fair enough, but the ball was still in play at the time, and I was 3-0 up. Soon to be 3-1 up. In fairness, glitches like this in a game that bravely attempts to accurately simulate the extraordinarily complicated physical and behavioural variables of a sport are to be expected, and it’s to FIFA’s credit that they’re relatively infrequent. And in the main, goalkeepers are – as they should be – hard to beat, yet still fallible. It’s thrilling to break an opponent’s back line, only for your rasping, top-corner drive to be thwarted by a fingertip save, bringing howls of anguish from the noisy crowd. Penetrating that defensive barrier can be quite a challenge at times, not least because opponents seem more ready than ever to put their bodies on the line. Blocked shots are a common occurrence, and even nippy forwards and wingers like Sturridge, Robben and Navas will struggle to accelerate clear of the last man, as lumbering defenders suddenly find a superhuman burst of speed to catch up with players they shouldn’t be able to get near. I get some joy by running into the channels and cutting inside, or back onto your other foot, particularly with flair players: long, mazy dribbles are now easier than ever, and players with low centres of gravity will skip over the outstretched boots of their markers, retaining the ball even as their shirts are being tugged.  This does mean that anyone who favours a crossing game may be disappointed. In the demo I scored far too many volleyed goals from long, arcing balls into the box, but that’s not the case in the finished game - though there’s an apparent sweet spot if you manage to double-up on one side. A short pass to a wing-back or wide midfielder and a first-time cross will finds a striker’s head more often than a regular cut-back from the byline. I’m slightly wary of suggesting finesse shots – and, to a lesser extent, flair shots - are overpowered, lest EA Sports nerf them too aggressively with another patch. But it’s true that in a one-on-one, squeezing the left trigger or right bumper as you let fly does give you a significant advantage. When you’re commanding one of Europe’s top sides in particular, maintaining possession in FIFA 15 is a joy. Slaloming past challenges as Carlos Tevez, say, is a rare treat, and when you’ve got the ball you’ll feel in almost total control. When you lose it, however, it’s another matter. That invisible bubble around attackers is harder to break than ever, not least because sliding challenges are more easily anticipated by players shifting their weight – one of the strengths of my defensive game is now a clear weakness - while minor infractions are more frequently punished. It doesn’t help that player positioning is bafflingly poor at times. You’ll give the ball away because an overlapping wing-back simply didn’t make the obvious run; even when you telegraph a pass into space, they’ll inexplicably fail to anticipate your plan. And whichever formation you choose, there’s often a huge gap in the middle of the park, frequently exploited by the AI in FIFA’s most egregious piece of scripting: defensive clearances. Should an opposing side head or hack the ball away, the chances of it bypassing your entire midfield and landing at the feet of their forwards is astonishingly high.  It’s akin to that classic uncanny valley effect – you can’t help but notice these issues all the more because FIFA gets everything else so right. The animation is sublime, while dribbling and turning is more gratifyingly responsive this year, and overall there’s a more palpably organic feel to each game: the loose balls, the interceptions, the deflections all make it more unpredictable and thus more satisfying. That’s when it lets you play, because this year it feels like EA Sports has built a game that’s often keener for you to watch. Cutaways intrude more frequently than ever, and you’ll have to wait several seconds in each instance before you’re allowed to skip them. When the ball goes out of play, you’re often reminded of a recent goal or incident by a replay, and while they’re often beautifully framed, after a while it feels like an indulgence, a way of inviting you to marvel at the way dirt and grass stain players’ shirts, or the evident wear and tear on the pitch. Though these interstitials should, perhaps, be optional, some players will relish a second viewing of a blistering strike. And the role of presentational tweaks shouldn’t be easily dismissed. The wealth of cosmetic changes during gameplay all contribute to the big-match feel, and helps you become more invested in the outcome of a game. If you’re a fan of a mid- to lower-table Premier League team in particular, the novelty of seeing the stands you’ve likely sat in and cheered your side on from, as well as hearing the chants of your fellow supporters, will take some time to wear off. There are welcome adjustments elsewhere, too. The addition of loan players to Ultimate Team gives you the opportunity to briefly employ a galactico to give your team a temporary boost, though it’ll bite a significant chunk out of your in-game funds that might be more wisely invested elsewhere. Better, perhaps to employ a former great who hasn’t lost their eye for goal: I got some good early mileage out of Diego Milito, for example. It’s now much easier to tailor your tactics according to who you’re playing, too – whichever game mode you choose, you can create and customise multiple team sheets to quickly switch between, rather than having to adjust your setup before every game. Meanwhile, the Match Day Live hub strengthens the growing ties between the game and the sport, giving fans the latest news updates and stats about their favourite team.  Increasingly, FIFA seems more interested in simulating a TV broadcast of a match rather than the beautiful game itself. In some cases, that’s not necessarily a bad thing: there’s something special about Martin Tyler reading out the team sheets and highlighting your team’s setup in the early stages of a match, while the recorded snippets of commentary are stitched together more seamlessly than ever. And yet even here there are problems: Tyler can’t resist an opportunity to discuss how a player performed in “the World Cup of 2014”, while Alan Smith seems obsessed with where exactly the ball hit the back of the net. The desire to feed back to the player, to demonstrate that it’s aware of what’s happening in both the game and the real sport, only serves to remind you that you’re not listening to two human beings converse. No commentary team would talk like this during a real-life match. It’s moments like this that highlight one of the biggest problems with annualised sports franchises: FIFA 15 is so keen to show what it’s doing differently, that its changes are more in service of the feature list on the back of the box than the quality of the simulation itself. My celebratory response to a last-minute Sebastian Giovinco volley which finally broke a stubborn Sassuolo rearguard action (their Park The Bus strategy proving frustratingly efficient) is testament to how FIFA can stir passions like almost no other game. But even with some sensible investments this season, it’s a little way short of its best form. FIFA 15 remains one of the most impressively comprehensive sport simulations around, and on new-gen hardware it really is the beautiful game. But while some of FIFA 15’s refinements are worthwhile – and a tangible improvement on FIFA 14 – its flaws stand out all the more. In some ways it’s a step forward, in others a step back - and with Konami’s PES seemingly in resurgent form, EA Sports can’t afford to take its eye off the ball.
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/22/d4-dark-dreams-dont-die-review	 D4 brings a bizarre murder mystery story to life, with all the pizzazz one would expect from Access Games, the studio behind cult classic Deadly Premonition. It casts us as David Young, a detective investigating the murder of his wife; driven by her final words “Look for D” and the ability to use certain objects to travel into the past. Can he find the killer? And can he change the past and save his wife? It’s a strong set-up for this new episodic series, and I greatly enjoyed this initial chapter, which includes a prologue and two episodes. The three or four hours of gameplay here is enough to lay the groundwork for the intriguing wider story, while also introducing a host of quirky characters and establishing a mystery within the mystery.  D4 is a more contained whodunit than Deadly Premonition. Where that game was set in an open-world and was very much a horror experience by way of Twin Peaks, D4 is much more like a locked box: a mystery with few settings, driven by characters and dialogue, with only a handful of quicktime action sequences. With a peculiar design style and aesthetic, D4 is offbeat, obtuse, and charming at best, and horrible to control and crammed with wilfully superfluous elements at worst. And that’s kind of the point. D4’s vibe is all its own, with an intriguing story that very much lays the groundwork for twists and revelations in future instalments. That story sees Young use his newfound power to jump aboard an airliner just in time to interrogate a man who deals in a dangerous drug that’s implicated in his wife’s death. He represents his own mystery, as Young knows the plane will be struck by lightning and he’ll disappear, seemingly into thin air. A host of questions are left unanswered by the end, but there’s still enough closure to be satisfying. D4 boasts a slick, painterly aesthetic. So how does it play? Well, you’re a detective, so you spend most of your time talking to people of interest and thoroughly exploring each location, trying to learn everything you can. You have a couple of control options, but despite being initially designed to be played with Kinect (controller support was added later) I’d definitely recommend sticking with a controller. Playing this game with Kinect is like trying to drink a bottle of wine using your hands as a cup, when there’s a glass right there. Kinect is just too unreliable, and there are just too many things to interact with. Who wants to spend their entire game sitting upright on the couch with a hand in the air? It’s a shame D4 wasn’t just designed for a controller from the start though, as it’s still pretty clunky even when using one. The action sequences actually ARE better with Kinect, but there aren't many. Given the gameplay is driven by quick-time action and Heavy Rain-style gestures, and there are no real puzzles to speak of, D4 really does live or die on its characters and personality. Thankfully, it delivers.Young isn’t as eccentric a lead as one might expect – no split personality or coffee-grounds fortunetelling here - but he gets more interesting as you tease out details about his past life and relationship with his murdered wife. Elsewhere, we have a cast that runs the gamut from a grizzled law-enforcement officer to a flamboyant fashion designer with a romantic attachment to a mannequin. Perhaps the best characters, however, are the most enigmatic, like Roland Walker, a towering giant in a crisp white suit, medical mask, and perpetually cocked head. He speaks in slow, drawn-out sentences and can only be seen by Young. The Twin Peaks influences most certainly remain. Duncan and Sukey play several fun roles within D4. Each episode is essentially linear, but also quite dense. There are secrets to find, reading material to absorb, countless objects to interact with, and numerous sub-cases that open up more conversational options. A great deal of this is tangential at best, but I found it hard to resist the lure of trying to unlock every line of dialogue, find every medal, and ‘observe’ every interactive item within the world. This last element is a particularly neat inclusion. If you hover the cursor over something before choosing to interact with it, short, often-pithy observations from Young pop up around it, providing further information and injecting humour into moment to moment play. There are other nods to his prowess as a detective, including an alternate vision mode – Batman’s Detective Mode, essentially – which lets you see objects and people that can be interacted with, as well as highlighting certain clues. It’s a good, quick way to ensure you’re not missing anything, and can be recharged by quenching Young’s thirst. You'll spend a lot of time observing stuff. A more bizarre inclusion is stamina. Pretty much every object you interact with uses up stamina - whether that’s turning on a faucet, opening a door or reading a magazine. Want to top it back up? Eat! It’s classic Access Games - a system for the sake of a system! Game director Swery and his team seem to be poking fun at the conventions of gaming: the need to quantify and limit things. Most amusing of all, they ultimately have no real meaning, given you’ll always have plenty of credits to buy any food and drinks required. You could absolutely say the same thing about the ability to change character outfits, or the medals hidden about the place – they’re an arbitrary treasure hunt, there without context or acknowledgement, because hey, games need collectables, right? Statement or not, in the end I couldn’t help but enjoy the superfluous elements – they just add to the oddball texture of D4. Pictured: oddball texture. D4 is an intriguing experience, and brimming with personality. It’s also the most polished game from Access to date, with a genuinely first-rate presentation. Wannabe gumshoes may not get a great deal out of it, as it largely leads you along through its introductory episode, but the characters and story are strong enough that it’s compelling nonetheless. D4 is even better second time around too, when most of the pieces are already in place and you can interpret every piece of information in context. Now, bring on the next part.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	 Minecraft has become a phenomenon over the past five years, and now the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One are some of the best places to play it. Though it may look primitive at a glance, your options in this virtual sandbox world are limited only by your imagination. Cobbling together a first home out of dirt and stone feels great; building a castle with a moat, a dining hall, and a working underground rail system feels even greater. That sense of creative progression, coupled with the inherent danger of exploring underground caverns full of monsters, makes Minecraft exciting, rewarding, tense, and one of gaming’s most expressive creative outlets.   Minecraft’s randomly generated worlds are composed of these big blocky cubes of dirt, stone, sand, and dozens of other materials. The blocks are colorful, distinct, and memorable thanks to simple but charming textures. What makes them great is how they enable creativity. Piece by piece you’ll rearrange and refine the pristine, primordial world into whatever you want. It could be a mountainside home, a huge tree house, a skyscraper, or any other creation you can envision. This is a power we rarely see in games, and the freedom it offers is, at first, daunting. In Survival mode, each block must be chipped at and collected by hand from an open world. What initially feels like a tedious task becomes the basis for Minecraft’s rewarding core gameplay. I had to gather, transport, and place each piece of my home myself, so it was impossible not to feel a fierce sense of pride and ownership over it and all my other creations, big and small.   When the sun goes down, Minecraft’s bad guys come for you. They are scary and dangerous… for maybe an hour. Once you obtain the simple items needed to ward them off, they become almost completely non-threatening. This feels immediately disappointing. Why have enemies at all if they become laughable in no time? But later, as my ambitions for building outgrew my resources on hand, my quest for new materials drove me deeper underground. Down there I realized those same enemies that are easy to defeat on the surface felt far more challenging to fight in the confines of a rocky corridor where they could ambush me. The amount of danger I was in was tied to how far from my base I roamed. Losing everything I carried to a Creeper who got the drop on me was a heartbreaking lesson, but the excitement of exploring new places and the risk it entails provided a constant tension. All the while, gathering new blocks and items sent my mind reeling with more ideas for landscaping and home decoration.   Those goals don’t change when you bring friends in, but whether you’re cooperating or trying to outdo each other with larger, grander creations, having other people there makes Minecraft more rewarding. The PS4 and Xbox One versions of Minecraft allow two- to four-player split-screen play, and there’s an online mode that accommodates up to eight. Joining other people’s worlds is easy, too, thanks to a simple, easy-to-use lobby. Unlike in the sometimes-cramped PS3 and 360 versions, the improved power of the new-generation consoles can handle vast worlds. They're 36 times larger, in fact, and there's plenty of room to spread out and build, even in a full eight-player game.   If you thought Minecraft was just about stacking blocks, the tutorial will wipe away that perception quickly. The quick and comprehensive introduction fully explains the basics of gathering, building, and crafting, and different stations around the tutorial world teach you how to enchant items, brew potions, start a garden, set up working electrical circuits, ride a boat, build golems, and more.  There’s a huge number of activities going on here. The crafting interface conveniently includes recipes for every item, and it highlights the items you don’t yet have in your inventory. With dozens and dozens of combinations available, the built-in recipes keeps you playing rather than hunting through wiki guides and memorizing recipes.   Minecraft’s many items and systems are too numerous to list in entirety, but a few stand out. As you kill things and mine certain materials, you’ll earn experience orbs which can be spent on enchantments. It makes mining and fighting things faster, easier, and more fun. The same can be said for potions, which heal you, grant resistance to fire, and more. Light RPG elements like these add depth to Minecraft without bloating the interface with skill trees or stat screens.   Under all that adventuring is Minecraft’s brilliant builder toy. Creative Mode basically enables all the cheat codes and lets you play with it freely, turning off monster damage, letting you fly, and giving you endless supplies of all the materials to build to your heart’s content. Without having to work and fight for them, my creations in this mode felt a little hollow. Still, Creative Mode is as much fun as a bottomless tub of LEGOs, and between the fun of flexing my own imagination and checking out the amazing projects other people have constructed, it’s full of possibilities. We’ve all spent a lot of time playing games where the goal is to kill things and break stuff down. It’s nice to finally play a game about building something up. Reshaping a pristine landscape into new world using your own two hands while things try to kill you isn’t just an amazingly rewarding gaming experience, it’s a clever retelling of human history. In a way, this is what we’re all instinctively driven to do, and Minecraft captures it brilliantly on new-gen systems.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	 [Editor's Note: We've been posting our impressions of Destiny since September 3rd. Our scored review was posted on September 18, 2014.] Within hours, l could tell that Destiny wants desperately to be loved by many different types of players. It attempts to weave threads from many popular genres together into one interconnected tapestry, but your experience will depend entirely upon which of those threads you tug on hardest.  At the very least, it provides blistering firefights and brilliantly crafted worlds to have them in. In fact, the exceptional caliber of its moment-to-moment gameplay is what partially excuses the fact that it never quite realizes its grand design. For as fun as it is, Destiny just doesn't fully commit to all of its disparate parts, making it simultaneously many different things, and none of them at all. Bungie has a history of excellent world-building, and Destiny is a powerful expression of that excellence. From the moment your AI companion wakes you from your long slumber in the shadow of the colossal wall around Old Russia, the world of Destiny feels grand. Picturesque, static backdrops are slyly blended with wide-open spaces and large vertical terrain features, creating an effective illusion of scale. The many stunning vistas go a long way towards making Destiny's world feel like one that's worth saving, despite the fact that you can’t fully explore everything you see. Even if it isn't as wide-open as it initially appears, each of Destiny's four main planets are more than big enough to get lost in. Even atop your speedy, instantly summonable Sparrow bike, which gleefully handles a lot like what I always imagined a Star Wars speeder bike might, getting from one end of a planet to the other takes a while. Factor in all the caves, temples, and other structures housed within, and there's a ton of ground to cover. Perhaps not as much as an open-world RPG or an MMO, but then, despite its similarities, Destiny isn't either of those things – and its overall topography has more character than most games of those types anyway. Even on last-gen hardware, the craft on display throughout Destiny's alien landscapes is masterful in its detail. Every rock face, outpost, and ruin looks lovingly hand-crafted, aside from a few repeating nooks and crannies. Even if I didn't always stop to gawk at how roads look physically carved into the terrain, or how gas bubbles to the surface of the iridescent water pools on Venus, these details silently pulled me in and constantly reinforced the idea that that this is an actual place – a special place.  Consistently excellent music magnifies that sensation, deftly driving the action forward during big firefights, and conveying a sense of wonder and mystery in between them. Even the somewhat over-indulgent load screen animations between worlds are eye-catching. Bungie made lemonade out of lemons here. Going from one planet to the other takes way too long, but it’s wisely used as an opportunity to double down on the idea that all these places are connected. Sadly, none of that keeps Destiny from becoming the latest example of the friction between open-world design, and tightly directed narrative. Cutscenes are kept to a bare minimum, limiting the story to vague exposition dumps before and after missions. It's not a new, or effective way to unintrusively tell a story though, regardless of how many Emmy Award-nominated actors you have reciting the lines. It says a lot about the quality of Destiny's combat that I gladly continued to move and shoot, despite it never really giving me an emotional incentive to do so.   Destiny retains the fluid, tactical feel of the Halo series, but with an increased sense of speed and mobility that make its firefights feel more dynamic than those of its direct FPS ancestor. That’s partly due to the ability to sprint and slide in addition to each class' mobility skills, which include gliding, double jumping, and even short-range teleportation. Combined with how powerful grenades and melee attacks feel, thanks again to class skills that modify them, this extra mobility allows you to engage foes in a wider variety of ways.  Destiny's intelligently designed combat areas provide excellent opportunities to leverage those options. It’s an impressive design feat when you consider how organically these areas blend with the open spaces that tie them together. I could, for instance, toss out a big vortex grenade to control space and force my enemies to back up behind cover, then sprint towards them, glide clear over their cover to greet them with a shotgun blast, and then catapult up to safety on a ledge above. Cover is smartly placed, and there’s enough horizontal and vertical space to allow for a variety of approaches, even in the most straightforward combat scenarios. You'll face four different races over the course of your journey, and their armies are each diverse and interesting. The cunning, multi-armed Fallen make excellent use of cover, will actively flank your position, and even attempt to lure you into ambushes. Other foes, like the robotic Vex, can teleport directly into combat out of nowhere, and still others have jump packs, cloaking devices, or massive riot shields to aid their advances. The range of different problems they can give you to solve is downright impressive, which keeps the combat fresh, and exciting throughout.  That is, with the exception of some of the bosses, who are mostly just super-sized versions of existing enemies with a lot more hit points. The two or three bosses that don’t fit that description, like the imposing spider tank, require more from you - you’ll have to find weak spots and coordinate with teammates to to stay alive, which resulted in more than one exciting “we did it!” moment. On the whole, the combat is so well executed that I never once tired of fighting in the multitude of hours I’ve played so far. That says a lot considering that fighting is, disappointingly, the only way you can meaningfully interact with the beautiful world around you.   Outside of combat, Destiny postures itself as far more than a simple FPS, but while its various RPG elements add some extra layers on top of its well-done combat, they don't feel fully explored or fleshed out. Part of that is because of what a poor job Destiny does of educating us about all of its moving parts, but it's also because it’s so hell-bent on being all things to all people that it unsurprisingly drops the ball in places.  Destiny's class and skill systems are the biggest victims of this. The Hunter, Warlock, and Titan all do the same things (stay alive and kill stuff), just in subtly different ways. Everybody can use every weapon type with equal proficiency, and until you get to the very highest levels of endgame gear, class-specific armor mostly just looks different. Next to how well-differentiated classes feel in Borderlands 2, or even Battlefield 4, none of Destiny’s classes feel like they bring anything indispensable to a party. As a direct result, playing cooperatively with others feels more like “shooting stuff with friends” rather than a carefully coordinated dungeon party. It’s still a good time, especially during the excellent co-operative strike missions, but it lacks the depth I look for in class-based games.  The RPG element that succeeds the most is the loot game. It doesn’t overwhelm with any sort of statistical complexity, but rather engages by presenting clear, meaningful choices. It gets off to a slow start though. Drop rates seem abysmal until somewhere around level 11 or 12, and gear has too few unique stats until then either. Eventually though, weapons and armor start dropping with interesting mods, and entire upgrade trees that allow you to tailor their feel and performance in interesting ways. From weapons that reload faster when their clip is completely empty, to ones that speed up your ability cooldowns when you score kills with them, there's actually a decent number of different ways to gear. Especially when you start getting into the legendary and exotic loot tiers after level 20, surprises keep coming from new, even crazier mods.  The problem though, is that the methods for earning post-story gear aren't clearly explained or, in some cases, even alluded to over the course of Destiny's 12-hour campaign. You’ll need to coordinate which bounties you take with what patrols you want to do, grind for several different currencies, and rank up your standing with a handful of factions - several of which are tucked away in the dark corners of the Tower hub. There’s a lot of room for post-story progression, but you either just start stumbling onto it...or you don't. For a game that trips all over itself to be simple and accessible to everybody, that's an unnecessarily confusing curveball to hit.   The half-baked nature of Destiny's RPG elements are just a symptom of a far larger issue: This is a game that’s straddling the borders between too many kinds of experiences, and in its attempts to have something for everyone, it never fully satisfies on any one front.  The competitive multiplayer, called The Crucible, is the chief example of this. The few included maps do sport Bungie's hallmark map design - they’re excellent, in fact. But without private lobbies to organize fights with friends, or any ways to customize the handful of game modes, it’s hard to imagine the multiplayer shooter enthusiast who could be satisfied with it. The same can also be said of how Destiny allows players to interact with one another - or rather, how it doesn't. Bungie calls Destiny a “shared-world shooter,” and the influences from the MMO world are clear in its overall layout and structure. Yet, there’s no way to communicate with anyone who isn't in your party, and there's no loot-trading either. Omissions like these become a big problem when you try to do the challenging weekly Heroic Strike missions and raids. Both are part of a healthy endgame, post-launch content plan that’s already delivered enjoyable new modes of play. The first raid, Vault of Glass, has given me plenty of incentive to grind for gear and further develop my character post-campaign. It introduces team objective elements to the PvE, and delivers entirely new locales and bosses that you won't get to see anywhere else in the game world.  The problem is, unlike Destiny's other co-op content, neither the Heroic strikes or raids provide matchmaking service, so unless I happen to have high-level friends who are ready to play, finding a party comes down to hitting message boards to look for a group. As someone who played mostly solo, I actually appreciated this sense of separation between me and other players, but people seeking a strong sense of community simply won’t find it here. Why do I need an internet connection for a game that feels so intent on putting barriers between me and other players? Simplistic “it’s like X mixed with Y” comparisons don’t really add up when attempting to explain what Destiny is, or why it’s worth playing. It borrows from many well-established gaming destinations, but the climate of each is wildly different, and often incompatible. It’s a complex production that boils down simply to this: Destiny is a mechanically excellent, visually evocative FPS housed within an under-developed RPG framework. The endgame might hook you for the long haul once you fully understand it, but Destiny is ultimately unable to be all the different games it’s trying so hard to be. IGN received access to Destiny when the servers went live on September 8th. As such, Destiny was approached as a review in progress.

Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	 EA Sports enjoyed a mostly uncontested stranglehold on the golf genre for the past decade, but with its re-tooled PGA Tour game not set to tee off until next year, 2014 presents the perfect opportunity for a new contender to swing its way into the market. Enter The Golf Club, a no-nonsense take on the walk-spoiling sport that makes up for its lack of licensed players and courses by applying a more realistic feel to its stroke play and featuring a robust course designer. Yet despite these strengths, its stiff challenge and bare-bones presentation make it a difficult approach for anyone other than diehard fans of the sport.   Little effort has been put into the creation of Golf Club’s golfers themselves. Not only can you not play as any PGA pros, you can’t even play as yourself unless by remote chance you already look like one of the half a dozen non-editable players available. You can make slight alterations to the colour of each item of their clothing, but that’s it. Anyone used to the dizzying amount of customisation options and myriad of real-world club and clothing manufacturers featured in the Tiger Woods games will likely be disappointed with the dearth of player-tailoring options on offer here. A similarly stripped-back level of design has been applied to the presentation out on the holes themselves. Commentary is sparse, there’s no gallery there to cheer you on, and you’ll certainly never see a ball explode off the tee with a smoke trail behind it or have your ego stroked by a multi-angle replay each time you nail a chip-in from off the green. Yet The Golf Club is more about appropriating the feel of the sport rather than dressing it up with good looks or flashy gimmicks. Each shot you take is bereft of the assists typical to modern golf games - there’s no swing timer to help you nail the right amount of power in your stroke, nor is there a virtual caddy to suggest which iron to use for your approach, nor aftertouch spin controls to correct a misplaced shot. All you’re given is the basic information for each hole - wind direction, distance to the pin and the elevation of the cup. It’s down to you to read the green and rely on instinct to choose the right club and shot type, and apply the right amount of power to your swing with the right thumbstick. Putting is hard to judge at first. Consequently, The Golf Club was really quite challenging for my first few hours with it, particularly due to the absence of any kind of tutorial mode. The slightest of deviations in each forward flick of the thumbstick caused balls to shank sideways into the brush, and it was tough to judge the length of my shots with the fully analogue putting. It seemed particularly hard to get to grips with after spending the past 10 years of my virtual golf career nestled within the Tiger Woods series’ more patronising embrace. But things improved with patience and experience, and over time my scores came down as I grew more proficient in reading greens and adjusting for the lie of the ball. It felt organic and rewarding, not unlike the real thing, as opposed to compensating for my own deficiencies by lazily beefing out a set of stat points in order to artificially power up my player. Having said that, The Golf Club does feel somewhat lacking as far as progression is concerned. One area in which the Tiger Woods games have excelled in recent years is keeping me engaged - I like the way it bombards us with spot-challenges and new gear to unlock at every turn. Without carrots like these to dangle in front of us in The Golf Club, there’s little incentive to keep playing beyond the enjoyment and challenge of playing itself. Not that there’s anything inherently wrong with that, but I would have appreciated some additional goals to strive for aside from merely trying to lower my handicap. The course creator is excellent. What did keep me returning to The Golf Club, however, was the sheer number of courses available. How many? A potentially infinite number, essentially - thanks to the powerful course creator and an active online community whose creations already number in the thousands. Granted, they’re not all gems, but you can sort the wheat from the chaff via the user ratings, and the more talented creators in the community have already been able to subvert The Golf Club’s lack of licensing by building convincing recreations of famous courses such as Pebble Beach and Augusta. Creating a course yourself is a straightforward process. You first select from a basic set of variables - terrain type, foliage density and the like, and then a course is procedurally generated for you to use as the base for your design. From there you can do as much or as little as you want to it - widen fairways, reshape putting greens, add and remove hazards and more, and you can even dive down at any point from your god-view into the shoes of your player to put your tweaks to the test. It’s an excellent feature entirely unprecedented for the genre - previously, the only additional courses we got our hands on in the Tiger Woods games came via paid-for DLC (or mods, on the PC side). My only gripe with the sharing of created courses in The Golf Club is that they’re read-only - I would have liked the option to take another user’s course as a starting off point and then have the ability to edit it more to my tastes. It should also be said that course generation and editing is substantially slower on the Xbox One and PS4 than it is in the PC version, making the creation process feel a lot more sluggish. (At the time of writing the development team claim that a patch to address that is on the way.) Out on the course the frame rate is also noticeably choppier on the Xbox One and PS4. Your mileage may vary with The Golf Club, depending on exactly what you expect out of a golf simulation. If you want a fast track to playing like a pro, then you might be put off by a lack of handholding when it comes to hitting the links. If, however, you’re a proper golf enthusiast, then The Golf Club’s more realistic brand of stroke play and potentially limitless number of courses could keep you hooked for months ahead. With a bit more polish applied to its presentation and the addition of a career mode to keep us hooked, this could well have been a package to seriously threaten EA’s dominance in the world of golf games. As it stands, it’s still a strong foundation for the team at HB Studios to build upon for the future.
Alex Rubens	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/21/madden-nfl-15-review	 Are you ready for some footbaaaaall? You should be, because Madden NFL comes out this time every year. It’s not a surprise, folks. What is a pleasant surprise is that Madden NFL 15 has turned out to be one of the better years for improvements to EA’s long-running football sim. There’s a majorly revamped defensive system that makes defending exciting again, improved play calling, and a system-wide focus on fine-tuning aspects of Madden that have been stationary for far too long. It looks wonderful on the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, too. For years, defensive play in Madden has always been a chore you have to do in between the fun parts where you’re trying to score. Things are different this year, and it’s a hugely important and long-overdue upgrade. Defense now feels impactful, like you’re in charge of how things play out instead of just waiting for the offense to mess up. It does this in two ways: first, you have this all-new defensive camera that faces toward the quarterback. You get to stare down your primary objective during pass rush, and race right toward him as soon as the play starts. Fighting your way through the offensive line with the mashing of the face buttons is an exciting charge. Then, if you manage to break free, you actually get to control how your tackle attempt plays out. It isn’t just about running at players and hitting them. You can choose to tackle high or low, and even modify the intensity of your hit. It’s all contextual and built toward being more realistic. This is increasingly important as the wonky physics system introduced in Madden 13 is still present, though slightly more refined. The only bummer is that this new defensive camera doesn’t work in local multiplayer. That’s a pretty big downside, but it’s a non-issue if you play mainly online. I’m also thrilled to see that a new play-calling system has replaced the simplistic suggestions from last year with something that strikes a great balance between complexity and ease of use. Instead of requiring you to dig through menus in-depth or simply handing you a play, Madden NFL 15 uses context to provide helpful play choices. Say you’re sitting at First-and-10; it’ll take statistics for your opponent’s typical defense in this situation and pair that with your common moves to provide you with the best play options. You can modify these based on what you’re looking to accomplish with the play as well, so if you want to take it strategically and not go for the big yards, it’ll suggest different plays on the fly to help you accomplish that. After years of EA trying out new systems that never seemed to work out, this is one I’d love to see stand the test of time.  All of my favorite parts of Madden are still around, too, including Connected Franchises and Ultimate Team. Actually, I’m more of a fan of the Offline Franchise and wish it wasn’t always trying to keep me online and engaging with friends in a fantasy football-like setting. Sometimes it’s nice to just build out a team and play on my own schedule. Ultimate Team has been slightly revamped to streamline the team-building systems a bit, getting rid of your reserve deck and focusing on your main team. That should be your main priority anyway, so the change works great. Unfortunately the card-pack microtransactions are still here, and still feel a bit gross, as if to capitalize on my impatient nature interacting with the player progression system.  Compared to the incremental graphics upgrades seen in  Madden 25, Madden 15 looks significantly more “next-gen.” Player and uniform textures look dramatically better. Games that take place at night under stadium lighting and in midday shadows look great, especially next to last year’s blown-out nightmares. Stadiums, too, are notably improved. This is much more like the intensity and hype that a Sunday night game has on TV. Unfortunately, this makes the travesty on the sidelines and in the crowds all the more apparent and noticeable, as the characters seen there continue the trend of looking significantly worse than anyone on the field and repeating every five feet. Every time the camera pans across the sideline, you’re sure to see no more than five faces repeated throughout 80 people. It seems that even the PS4 doesn’t have the horsepower to beautify the masses. After the letdown of Madden 25 last year, Madden 15 feels like a mostly fresh start for the series. The increased emphasis on defensive play, a great new play-calling system, and the return of long-time favorites makes this year’s Madden one of the best in recent memory, even if it could still use work in regards to its stale commentary and longstanding bugs. As a lifelong Madden and football fan, I’m impressed. This year’s game is both exciting and reassuring that EA Sports isn’t wasting opportunities to improve the series.
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	" As dank, irradiated hellholes go, the Moscow Metro might be my favorite one to visit. Sure, it's part of a post-apocalyptic future where mutant predators run rampant and the remnants of humankind live in crumbling subway stations masquerading as city-states, but the Metro has a distinct culture, colorful survivors, and haunting secrets that are almost as much fun to discover as they are horrifying. It's also the setting of two games – Metro 2033 (review) and Metro: Last Light (review) – that smartly weave storytelling, stealth, and first-person gunplay into one long, darkly beautiful narrative, and Metro: Redux brings them together in one enhanced package for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. If you've never plumbed the Metro's murky depths (or are itching for an excuse to return), this is a fantastic way to experience them. It’s a journey that takes you through creepy tunnels and ruins haunted by shaggy monsters and eerie phantoms, in which tense moments of stealth or exploration might suddenly give way to explosive, crowded firefights. Here, bullets are currency, guns are ugly and homemade, gasmasks spell the difference between life and death, and everyone calls them ""gosmosks"" in hokey faux-Russian accents. (Also, get ready to hear lots from veteran anime-and-game actor Steve Blum, who lends his gravelly voice to roughly half of the characters.) That’s all unchanged from the original version on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC, but Redux improves on both the graphics and gameplay in significant ways - mostly for the better. It begins with the choice of whether to scuttle through the tunnels in Survival mode – which promises harsher, Metro 2033-esque threats and scarce resources – or storm them with plentiful ammo and faster pacing in the Last Light-inspired Spartan mode. (If you forget which one you chose, just look at your watch – 2033's analog model shows up in Survival, while Spartan features Last Light's digital timepiece. This makes no difference gameplay-wise, but it's a nice touch.) Being able to pick your pace and style of gameplay is a cool feature, although it's worth noting that playing through Metro 2033 on Survival mode in Normal difficulty definitely feels more forgiving than the original, so players looking for a serious challenge should immediately kick it up to Hardcore. In Survival, gasmask filters – which put a timer on your lifespan when you're exploring Moscow's toxic surface streets – were often in short supply, but I never had to use military-grade bullets (which double as currency and powerful last-resort ammunition) until the very end, I never ran out of medpacks, and devastating weapons – like silenced shotguns and Kalashnikovs – were usually within easy reach.  Watch our original Metro 2033 review. Then again, part of the reason this new Metro 2033 is easier is that it's no longer tripping over its own feet. Not only do its new character models and brighter lighting make it easier to spot enemies and see detail (at the expense of some of the original's moodiness), but its clunky menus and controls have been ditched in favor of Last Light's more intuitive equipment wheels and Call of Duty-esque handling. That's a big improvement, but the biggest one is that the enemy AI feels more consistent, making it possible to sneak around or stealth-hunt packs of hostile guards without the risk of arbitrarily bringing all their friends crashing toward your exact location once they spot a body. Also, Metro 2033 has been retrofitted with the same little touches that make guard-hunting especially fun (if not particularly challenging) in Last Light – like musical cues that tell you when guards are near, what their alert status is, and when you've scored a kill or are in danger of being spotted. Not all of the battles are as interesting as the stealth opportunities, though. 2033 still loves hurling fistfuls of monsters at you in open areas, particularly in the final levels, where you'll get so badly mobbed that it starts to feel like some level designer went berserk with a rubber-stamp tool when placing them. Those moments fall just short of lasting too long, though, and while it lacks some of the original's tough, dismal charm, Redux is overall a much smoother, more enjoyable, and better-looking way to experience Metro 2033.  Watch our original Metro: Last Light review. The same can't be said of Redux's version of Metro: Last Light – but only because Redux doesn't tinker with it nearly as much. As before, Last Light Redux’s gameplay is more exploration-focused and diverse than Metro 2033 (and includes bosses and more overt moral decisions), and it tells a more compelling story that focuses on the Metro's human characters, political intrigues, and supernatural weirdness. It also spends a lot more time above ground, amid Moscow's more dazzling ruined landmarks, and it’s just as much fun to play through now as it was in 2013, with plenty of monsters to shoot at, lots of opportunities to hunt guards in big environments filled with hiding places, and more side activities to get distracted by. Already a great-looking game, this Last Light is visually a step up from the previous PS3/360 iteration, although Redux's PlayStation 4 and Xbox One editions still aren’t on par with the 2013 PC version running at high settings – which is disappointing, if not surprising. Actually, both Last Light and Metro 2033 look notably sharper on PC, while PS4 feels like a small visual step down; things like floating particles might not have the same crisp definition, but otherwise I wouldn’t notice the difference unless you’re looking at them side by side. The Xbox One version, meanwhile, runs in 912p rather than 1080p, making it technically the weakest of the bunch - although each version plays identically, and again, it’s hard to notice a difference unless you’re playing each version one after the other.  Console differences aside, Last Light Redux is clearly the definitive version, packing in every single piece of DLC (including the excellent, Dark Souls-esque Kshatriya add-on, set in a freely explorable version of the monster-filled Moscow Library) and even bringing back the ability to get a close-up view of Artyom's watch – an essential tool for knowing how much gasmask time you have left, if you're playing in the HUD-disabling Ranger difficulty mode. Despite their seemingly miserable setting, both Metro games are in fact fun, diverse shooter-adventures, and the remastered 2033 does a good job of smoothing down the original's rougher edges at the expense of some of its brutal personality. Getting both in a single, enhanced package is a great way to discover (or rediscover) the Moscow Metro's unconventional charms."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	 It's been a long road for Diablo 3 fans, following every twist and turn from pre-release to now, hoping that the Diablo game they truly wanted was right around the next corner. Don't get me wrong, Diablo 3 nailed the moment-to-moment combat experience from the get-go, but the reward loop was way off-kilter. With the release of the Reaper of Souls expansion on PC, the somewhat erratic rhythm of its reward and progression cycle steadied into constant thrum. Now, with the Ultimate Evil Edition on PS4 and Xbox One, Diablo 3 takes on its highest form, melding the successes of two years of patching with the positive side-effects of porting to current-gen consoles.  Ultimate Evil Edition teems with content. You're getting everything from Diablo 3 and its expansion, Reaper of Souls, including the incredible endless Adventure mode. The raised level cap, reworked skills, and of course that handy fourth passive slot are all here as well, and importing your character from a last-gen console is a breeze, so you won't have to replay a bunch of content you've likely already replayed over and over to experience it. If you're returning from the original console release, you won't miss a beat.  If you're a new player, and you don't already know what's in store, just ignore the cheesy story. Diablo 3 is about killing things, all the things, whether alive, undead or inanimate, and seeing what sweet new piece of gear drops so you can kill more, bigger things. Ultimate Evil's excellent analog stick controls, deep bestiary, and varied character classes make that hunt enjoyable both in the short term, and the long haul. A regular stream of upgrades and legendary items means that even over the course of a short, 1-hour play-session, you'll often see your avatar make tangible progress, and by your 200th hour in the endless, infectiously rewarding adventure mode, you'll still be finding ways to eke out ever more power from your character. I can still remember leveling my first character In vanilla Diablo 3 to 60 without crafting a single thing, or even making very many decisions. Starting a new character from scratch really highlighted how much Blizzard has changed for the better. That well-tuned cycle of  violence, profit, and growth is easier on the eyes than ever here too. Last-gen consoles had to make visual sacrifices to run Diablo 3's more heated battles at a respectable frame rate, but on PS4 and Xbox One, no concessions are necessary. At 1080p, and an almost constant 60 fps, the action looks sharp, plays smooth, and is mostly on par with Reaper of Souls on a nice gaming PC. There are very occasional hiccups in framerate during huge battles, and the effects, while greatly improved, aren't quite at max PC levels, it's still a huge step forward from the last console iteration. Finally, Ultimate Evil serves up a few social-minded twists like an in-game mail system to gift loot to friends, and a new nemesis system which allows a monster that slays someone on your friend's list to grow in power and come into your game to give you a chance to avenge your fallen comrade. It's a cute trick, but not a game-changer in any way. The real star is still the ability to play on the couch with up to three friends, tearing through the angry hordes that await you in adventure mode, where the wildly randomized dungeons form the backbone of Diablo 3's endgame.   This is the third time I've reviewed some version of Diablo 3, and each time I've been met by a better, more refined experience. Ultimate Evil Edition collects the entirety of that experience in a slick new wrapper, giving console owners a complete, and uncompromised version of Diablo 3.
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	" If you were to judge Ori and the Blind Forest solely by appearances – its prominent images of Ori being cuddled by his rotund adoptive mother Naru, for instance – you might assume you were in for a short, pleasantly tepid art-house platformer, the kind where gameplay exists mainly to support lavish graphics and the emotional pull of the story. Instead, Ori is a demanding, cleverly intricate Metroidvania-style adventure in which a quick trigger finger and perfect timing matter almost as much as exploring its secret-filled environments. That it’s also stunningly pretty, includes a sweeping orchestral score, and tugs at the heartstrings certainly doesn't hurt, either.  Of course, the forest can’t be saved as easily as simply returning your floating companion to his tree. Three stolen, life-sustaining elements need to be restored to their respective homes first, and finding them means trekking across a huge 2D landscape of interconnected areas, uncovering hidden power-ups, and earning new abilities along the way. Like any good Metroidvania, these abilities – which let Ori pull off moves like double-jumping, wall-climbing, stomping through weak platforms, and grabbing enemies or projectiles to slingshot himself in different directions – open up new areas for exploration while adding to Ori's combat repertoire. The progression from powerless sprite-child to nimble engine of destruction is elegantly smooth, with so many opportunities to use each skill that, by the time you've discovered the next one, using the previous ability will have become second nature. That's important, because Ori's exploration sometimes feels like training for the real challenges: Its dungeons, a trio of self-contained levels that push you to make heavy use of whatever abilities you've found beforehand, and which sometimes feature unique challenges, like carrying a gravity-bending orb that lets Ori safely walk upside-down across lethally hot surfaces. While taxing, those feel like cakewalks next to each dungeon's climax: an intense, no-room-for-error escape sequence that makes Metroid's time-bomb finales seem tame by comparison. Here, the difficulty spikes wildly as you're forced to execute a precise series of moves while death closes in on your heels. With no checkpoints, mastery through repetition becomes crucial, and that mastery gets a little easier if you can rely on muscle memory to, say, catapult yourself over an incoming fireball before scampering up a wall to relative safety. The escape sequences walk a fine line between being rewardingly difficult and infuriating, partly because they disable your most important ability: the creation of ""Soul Links,"" which let you save almost anywhere. There's very little auto-saving in Ori, and death reverts you to your last save, so it's up to you to remember to save often. If you do, Soul Links are a huge asset, letting you instantly respawn just before (or after) trouble spots and saving you the hassle of repeating tough areas. Forget to use them, however, and it might take you a while to find your way back to where you were. Not that that's necessarily a chore; Ori's level design is striking, with lots of distinct, memorable areas that are fun to get around in even after you've visited them a few times. And while there's no fast-travel in Ori's sprawling world (which is mildly annoying), it compensates by making backtracking actually enjoyable. As you work your way back to a previously unreachable spot, your new powers are almost guaranteed to help you discover a few hidden power-ups and secret areas along the way, making the trip feel worthwhile. If you're a completist, however, you'll want to fill out the map before tackling Ori's final stage; completing the 10-hour story locks your save file, forcing you to start a new game (unless you had the foresight to make a pre-endgame copy of your save) if you want to discover things you missed. As fun as exploration is, combat is a little more uneven. Hammering enemies with fireballs is satisfying at first, but feels weak and ineffectual later on, so it's often better to use Ori's other moves, like catapulting enemy projectiles back at their owners, bashing monsters into thorny walls, or simply stomping them when they get underfoot. Having a diverse range of attacks is great, but none of them feel quite as precise as simply shooting, and they can frequently backfire (by sending Ori shooting into thorns, for example) while you're learning to use them effectively.  Also, Ori always feels fragile, even when his life meter is filled out, and his tiny onscreen presence (coupled with the abundance of glowing projectiles flying both ways) can sometimes make it hard to tell exactly where you are, who's shooting, and whether that shimmering blob sailing toward you is acidic goop or a clutch of harmless XP orbs. It doesn't ruin the experience, but it can lead to a few awkward deaths as you frantically leap into danger to grab a power-up. Bigger and tougher than it looks, Ori and the Blind Forest is a beautifully realized, brilliantly designed, and at times brutally difficult sylvan Metroidvania-style platformer with enough charm to leave a lasting impression. It's often frustrating and sometimes confusing, but its spectacular platforming, memorable world, and engrossing story wash those concerns away."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/09/guacamelee-super-turbo-championship-edition-review	" Not surprisingly, Guacamelee! remains as awesome as it was in early 2013 (read the Guacamelee! review here), when it could only be played on the PlayStation 3, Vita, or PC, and lacked its new Super Turbo Championship Edition suffix. Yet developer DrinkBox didn't just give Guacamelee! a slight change here and a little reworking there while porting it to virtually every platform under the sun (Xbox 360, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Wii U). This really is more of a ""1.5 version” (think Soul Sacrifice Delta to Soul Sacrifice), so even if you've 100%'d and Platinum'd Guacamelee! back in the day like I did, there are plenty of reasons to go back for more apart from experiencing an amazing game again. With some new tweaks, the inclusion of all its DLC, and an unexpectedly large chunk of all-new content, Juan's Metroidvania-style platforming adventure maintains that goofy undead luchadore heart and soul a bit longer. Little changes, like life bars above enemies and the inclusion of silver coins that allow you to buy costumes in-game, are barely noticeable in the grand scheme of things. What’s important are whole new areas of the map to explore, some never-before-seen enemies to fight, and even a new boss that works his way into cutscenes and the overall story. You didn't see this in the original. These new areas, like the rest of Guacamelee!, are stunning to look at, fun to play through, and throw their own mixture of platforming and enemy-based challenges at you. Some of these aforementioned enemy-centric challenges come by way of new foes that add a dynamic layer upon the game's already exceptional combo-based combat. Some of these foes, marked with black outlines, can disappear and reappear at will, making them wily and unpredictable combatants. Much of Guacamelee!'s challenge comes more from exceptional feats of platforming than it does from actual, difficult fights, but these guys change the formula up a bit. And an all-new boss enemy -- El Trio de la Muerte -- isn't only humorously designed, but integrated well into Guacamelee's already existing narrative with nary a hiccup. One change I wasn't incredibly fond of, however, was the new ability to go into ""Intenso"" mode. By filling up a new bar underneath your health and special ability meters, Juan can charge himself up and go ballistic on enemies for a short period of time, busting heads while barely breaking a sweat. Since the crux of Guacamelee! continues to revolve around its awesome grappling and combo systems, going Intenso felt forced, and throws away a lot of Guacamelee!'s more nuanced and satisfying combat in lieu of button mashing-type, seconds-long frays that seem out of place. Ultimately, I found its inclusion unnecessary. Still, since you have a third meter to keep track of, that means more collectibles to find to upgrade said meter, which is awesome. Kick, punch, it's all in the mind. Perhaps STCE's most substantial addition comes in the form of the inclusion of El Infierno, which was an add-on DLC pack on PS3 and Vita that gives you a series challenge rooms to try and overcome. All of that is included in STCE right off the bat, extending Guacamelee!'s admittedly short playtime. That playtime -- which may take between five and seven hours, depending on how thorough you are -- is still my biggest gripe. Guacamelee! is too damn short, which is, frankly, a testament to how good it is. I wish it was 15 or 20 hours long like some of the Metroidvania games that so clearly inspired it. Guacamelee! Super Turbo Championship Edition isn't a vapid rebranding or a blatant cash-in, but a welcome infusion of the original game with new areas, monsters, and bundled-in DLC. I'd definitely recommend it even to those that already experienced it on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, or PC. Guacamelee! was one of last year’s finest games, and now it's one of PlayStation 4's, Xbox One's, Xbox 360's, and Wii U's best, too."
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/27/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark-review	 A Transformers game really only has to deliver on two simple things: make it fun to transform, and make it fun to destroy robots. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is a dud on both of those fronts, and it throws in a confusing story to boot.  Rise of the Dark Spark has a simple storyline about the bad guys wanting to find the Dark Spark and the good guys trying to stop them. That should make for a straightforward campaign, but a few factors derail the plot. Whereas previous Transformers games, War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron, had separate Autobot and Decepticon campaigns, Rise of the Dark Spark’s 14-mission campaign switches between sides without much reason or notice, and unevenly at that. In the middle of the Decepticons capturing the important relic, you jump to an Autobot mission where they're on the hunt, and after the halfway point, the Decepticon's side of the story just stops being told as the Autobots march towards their inevitable victory. The switches are jarring enough that you might forget which side you're on at more than one point during the early stages. What’s even more confusing is that in order to tie into the concurrently released Transformers: Age of Extinction movie, Rise of the Dark Spark's entire cast sports the same faux-gritty style of the films, where little separates the factions besides a tiny logo. Aside from the always-game Peter Cullen reprising his role as Optimus Prime, there's few noteworthy performances from the rest of the cast. Jazz tries to be the comic relief, but has nothing funny to say, Drift counterbalances his unique design by being exceedingly dull, and the Decepticons only come in two flavors: cackling underlings and brooding leaders. The dull audio and level design extends outward, as the soundtrack is a grating Hans Zimmer-style bombast mixed with dubstep, while the stages alternate towards bland, dilapidated Earth cities and samey labyrinth outer-space bases. The few times Rise of the Dark Spark dares to venture outside on other planets it makes for memorable diversions, but those levels are rare exceptions. Shooting is serviceable, largely due to a pretty impressive suite of weapons. Each of the 20 guns you wield in robot form has a very distinct style, from standards like the semi-automatic and shotgun to more esoteric ideas like an electric beam that chains between enemies, a slime cannon that slows down and poisons enemies, and Dead Space-like blade and bolo shooters. However, the enemies you'll use them on aren't much fun to fight with. With the exception of the uniquely shielded “Titan” Decepticon troops, enemies have few intelligent tactics. The ones that lack overpowered weapons will perform extreme evasive maneuvers that are doubly frustrating, since you usually need to clear out all enemies in particular sections to progress. Mindless, unsatisfying melee strikes don’t add anything. There are special attacks unique to each Transformer, but they’re either overpowered in cases like Drift's sword slice, or useless, like Sharpshot's cloaking ability.  The nail in the coffin is that vehicular transformations fail to spice up the combat. If the Transformer you're playing as turns into a car, you can expect clunky turning and a dire lack of a sense of speed, even if you engage both boost and turbo; why there are two separate speed boost buttons is a mystery. The air-based transformations aren't as bad, but since there's no radar, tracking down flying enemies is an annoying game of hide and seek. And for some reason there’s only one Dinobot and one Insecticon transformation during the campaign, but plenty to choose from exclusively in multiplayer. Seems like a waste. Outside of upgrading your guns with larger clips, quicker reloads, and bonuses specific to each weapon, the rest of Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark's progression systems fall flat. Unlockable Gear Boxes function much like the customization packs in Mass Effect 3 or Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare. However, there's just too much inside these packs. Between the weapon upgrades, new weapons, additional multiplayer characters, multiplayer-only abilities, T.E.C.H perks, and “Hack” difficulty modifiers that work like Halo's skulls, the process of slowly sifting through each item becomes boring fast.  It's slightly less annoying to open Gear Boxes while preparing your character for the online co-op Escalation mode, which is sort of a microcosm for the mode itself. Pitting you and up to three teammates against 15 waves of progressively more difficult enemies on eight well-designed maps, there's a sense of urgency in Escalation, whether it be as you race to revive a teammate or scour the map to replenish or replace a weapon running low on ammo. Escalation doesn't have the epic boss encounters of Gears of War's Horde mode, the alternate objectives of Mass Effect 3, or the insane extraction endings of Plants vs. Zombies: Garden Warfare's Garden Ops, but it's still the most entertaining part of Rise of the Dark Spark. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is available on seven different platforms, a 3DS strategy game (not reviewed here), and a action-shooter that plays similarly on PC, PS3, PS4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and Wii U. On the PC, PS4, and Xbox One, the game runs smoothly, though there are a few spots where textures are too low res to fit in with the highly detailed robots themselves. On the PS3, Xbox 360, and Wii U, expect muddy textures, jaggy character models, and pretty awful pop-in on buildings and complicated textures, especially noticeable on things like chain link fences. On the Wii U, the Game Pad simply mirrors what's being shown on your TV screen; there's no touch-pad usage or additional info to glean on the screen. Also, the Wii U version does not include the multiplayer Escalation mode. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark has a few bright spots; the co-op Escalation mode is enjoyable, and there are cool weapons befitting the bots. But the bland campaign is a slog with uneven difficulty, while vehicle transformations and combat are largely unsatisfying. Without nailing that, you’ve got a bad Transfomers game.  Editor's Note: We screwed up a little. In our haste to get this review out to you as soon as possible, we didn't notice that the Wii U version doesn't contain the best part of Rise of the Dark Spark: the mulitplayer Escalation mode. That version deserves a lower score, so we'll update that on Monday. Our apologies for the oversight!
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/19/ea-sports-ufc-review	 Tension, and danger – these two elements are what make mixed martial arts thrilling to me, and sadly, these are the two things that EA Sports UFC just cannot conjure up. EA has certainly put on a good show, and laid a sound foundation upon which to build the next UFC game, but several errant balance and design decisions regarding both striking and grappling knock the teeth out of what should feel like a high-stakes game of inches.  UFC was built exclusively for the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and it shows. These are some of the most impressive character models and animations I’ve ever seen in a game. Even up close and in motion, they appear natural and believable. Especially during pre-match introductions, these virtual fighters convincingly exude the personalities of their real-life counterparts. Georges St-Pierre conducts himself with measured discipline, and The Axe Murderer creepily rolls his hands while maintaining an icy cold stare. Combined with the spot-on TV-style presentation and energetic commentary, these touches help successfully bottle the tone and energy of a big UFC pay-per-view event.  Even when fists start flying, good transitional animations and hit reactions keep things looking fluid and organic, though it’s disappointing that most of the grappling animations are the same from character to character. That doesn’t keep the sheer detail of the animations from impressing though. Skin ripples with impact, fighters visibly wince in pain with every crushing leg kick, and hands flail for leverage when the fight heads to the ground. These are flesh and blood warriors, not a pack of uncanny-looking puppets. Mixed Martial Arts is an extraordinarily complex sport, and I’m pleased that EA tried not to dumb it down at all. There are a ton of options for attack, defense, stand-up, and mat-work, but it’s more than the control scheme can readily handle. Be prepared to hold multiple shoulder buttons while fiddling with the analog sticks and face buttons – all simultaneously. I got used to it, but this isn’t a game most people should expect to pick up and play quickly. Where UFC really gets into the weeds is with its overall balance. Having watched a good share of mixed martial arts, it’s off-putting and deflating to see how the whole cast shrugs off shots that would fell even the stiffest-chinned fighters in the world. If Anderson Silva is whipping you around in a thai clinch, landing repeated knee-bombs to your face, that should be a wrap no matter who you are. The same goes for submission battles. The system behind these grappling chess matches is actually pretty fun, and it’s cool how it takes fighter’s stats and stamina into consideration. But every sub attempt becomes a minute-long, multi-staged duel no matter what. In fairness, this can happen in a real UFC fight, but just as often, great jiu-jitsu practitioners will find an opening and slap a quick hold on for a decisive tap-out. It’s unpredictable and dangerous to attempt. The fact that you can absorb a seemingly endless amount of punishment, and have forever to wiggle free of submission attempts made me feel safe no matter the situation…and safe is the opposite of how I want to feel in an MMA game. I want to think twice before throwing a punch when The Spider starts bobbing and weaving. I want to tremble in fear when BJ Penn starts smothering me with his rubber guard to set up a gogoplata.  The same lack of stakes permeates the entire grappling game too. Sweeping and passing is just too easy, since you will always succeed unless your opponent does the correct counter. That might sound fair on paper, but in practice it takes all the urgency out of the ground game. I’m never more than a single click of the analog stick away from getting back to my feet if my opponent misses their counter window, which makes fighting for a dominant position more or less meaningless. Is this real life? Outside of the ring, UFC has little of value to offer. There’s a series of challenges that teach you things that probably should have been in the tutorial you get wrangled into on first boot up. Online play is functional, but the career mode is more or less an endlessly repeating cycle of boring, repetitive menus, and cheesy “atta boy!” FMVs. Customizing and progressing my fighter would have been a lot more fun if I didn’t have to wade through so much tedium to do so. EA Sports UFC looks the part to a tee, and its exhaustive list of moves and techniques represent the complex nature of the sport well. But knowing that each second could be your fighter’s last is what gives weight and drama to mixed martial arts, and without that, these bouts fall flat. I love the amount of respect the developers clearly have for every aspect of the sport, but reverence and attention to detail alone can’t stand in for a missing sense of danger and excitement.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	 Murdered: Soul Suspect’s first red herring comes five minutes in. As dead detective Ronan O’Connor, you are promised an enormous and exciting ghostly skillset with which to solve complex crimes, right wrongs, and gain unbridled access to the real-world town of Salem, Massachusetts. But by the time the credits roll, that promise has only been partially fulfilled. Being a ghost in Murdered is enjoyable in fits and starts, yet the use of your powers is brutally limited, resulting in an almost entirely scripted and therefore watered-down afterlife experience.   Our hero Ronan is a roughly sketched amalgam of every anti-authority, lone-wolf detective popularised in film during the late ‘60s and early ‘70s; a gravel-voiced cliche under a fedora. Yet the mystery lying at his feet is more unusual than most, as Ronan has a series of bulletholes in his chest and his ‘unfinished business’ is to discover the identity of his own killer. It’s a powerful whodunnit set-up, which kept me invested - just - for the ten hours it took to reach the reveal, despite narrative shortcomings elsewhere. An insistent yet irrelevant sub-plot involving Ronan’s wife, for example, evokes a particularly clunky romance novella, while the thoughts of possessed citizens that Ronan is able to hear are oddly mundane. The supporting cast fails to make an impression too, save for Joy, a spirited young medium - terrifically voiced by Entourage actress Cassidy Lehrmam - who deserves more screen-time. Similarly, Salem, with its rich real-life history, feels wasted as a setting. Murdered’s small sandbox, (truly the loosest use of that term), offers little variation in environment and restricts the player's natural instinct to explore it at every turn. One of its more interesting features; a ghostly overlay of parts of the town during its most notorious years in the 1600s, is mostly used as an environmental trick to prevent you from going beyond the game world’s close confines. The explanation for this feels arbitrary: Ronan can’t pass through other ghostly matter because he’s a ghost, and he can’t access three quarters of the town’s buildings as they’ve been ‘consecrated’ by Salem’s citizens. The developer didn’t have time to make a bigger, more interesting world, in other words. Walk through NPCs like you walk through walls. Such limitations extend to your toolbox. While Ronan can, theoretically, do all the cool things you’d want a ghost detective to be able to do: walk through (some) walls, analyse the ghostly residue of a murder scene, interrogate other ghosts, possess humans and animals to influence them and read their thoughts, and move objects about like a poltergeist - you’ll rarely find any use for his abilities outside of the tightly scripted story which you’re funneled through. This is particularly frustrating considering Ronan’s investigations in Murdered require very little actual brain work. The business of solving puzzles, which boils down to ‘analysis’ of a crime scene by either collecting every clue using your ghost skills and selecting the most relevant one, or linking together a series of clues to form a cohesive timeline of events, equates to meaningless busywork as the solution is more often than not blindingly obvious from the get-go. The ability to scrutinise the ghostly residue of a dramatic memory captured in a three-dimensional still - the killer searching for a victim, for example, or a cowering victim sobbing in terror - is perhaps the most ridiculously simplistic in Ronan's investigatory repertoire. It’s hard to feel the developer is taking us seriously when our multiple-choice descriptors of someone pleading for their life are words like Scared, In Charge, Calm, Tense or Confident. For a game centered on a murder mystery, it’s baffling that Murdered is devoid of any real, challenging sleuthing. If only Salem were a little more interesting. When the answers aren’t so obvious - and generally this is when the task at hand, not the solution, is obtuse -  there seems to be no consequence for failure. Even when you don’t guess the most relevant clue on your first attempt, there is no option but to get to the answer eventually through process of elimination. While you are rated on your ‘detective work’ on a case by case basis, the judgement seems meaningless; no branching storylines are shut off from you for screwing up, and there is no overall rank offered at the end to make you want to try again and do better. Enemy encounters, which are few and far between, offer more room for freedom and tactical thinking. The only way to dispose of Murdered’s genuinely frightening soul-sucking demons is to get immediately behind them, and the only way to get immediately behind them is to hide in the residue of individual ghost souls, which are tightly packed together and therefore create a sort of teleportation system for Ronan.  It’s a neat, fun idea, and one that is bizarrely underutilised and unexplored for a game trying to sell an atmosphere of danger. Murdered's soul sucking demons are genuinely frightening. A multitude of side quests pump a little life into Murdered. Populated throughout Salem are ghosts who, like Ronan, are stuck between this world and the next by virtue of their unfinished business. Ronan can help these people move on by solving their conundrums, and while the process of doing so is no more satisfactory than it is in the central quest, many of these encounters are memorable stories. Helping a guy who can’t remember who was behind the wheel in a drunk-driving accident, for example, or revealing the heroic nature of a death to someone who thought otherwise, are nice little human touches in a larger story that regularly serves to remind you of the futility of death. There are some great concepts in Murdered: Soul Suspect, but they feel undercooked or underutilised, and the lack of demand for any real input from us makes Murdered feel like a pick-a-path game where there’s only one path. It scrapes by on the power of its central whodunnit mystery, but I can’t help but feel that Murdered: Soul Suspect is ten hours worth of unfinished business.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review	 In its opening scene, Watch Dogs refers to hackers as modern-day magicians. That’s a good analogy for the bag of powerful but mostly scripted tricks we get to use as we run amok in this huge and impressively detailed map of Chicago. With the push of a button, you can trigger environmental traps that smash pursuing cars, empty a citizen’s bank account, or even remotely activate a grenade in an enemy’s pocket. Hacking’s not as dynamic as it appears at first, but the illusion gives us a bit more to do than there is in most third-person action games, and it puts on a great show.   Our hero, Aiden Pearce, is an empty trenchcoat as far as personality goes. It’s remarked at one point that he’s suppressing his personality, so it must be intentional, but it doesn’t make him a strong character. Fortunately the supporting cast is much more interesting. An enthusiastic and cavalier fixer, a gang leader who I affectionately refer to as Avon Barksdale: Superhacker, and a soft-spoken mob boss steal the show and make it a likeable and well-acted group. Character animations are elegantly done, too. Watch Dogs’ completely open map is another big strength: it’s huge, diverse, and intricately detailed. The rural area of Pawnee balances out Chicago’s urban sprawl, and it all looks great, especially at sunset or during a rainstorm. Everything runs at a smooth 30 frames per second, however, after playing for a few hours I did start to experience frequent slowdowns when new mission objectives were loading up. Fortunately they never happened when anything interesting was going on, but they’re definitely noticeable and get progressively worse as the story goes on. This techno-thriller fiction is all about the power of information in a super-connected city, and one of its cleverest and most distinctive tweaks to the open world genre is how much information it gives you. Scanning a pedestrian or thug pops up a brief, randomly generated personal history – some fact about their hobbies or lifestyle, plus their age, occupation, and income. It’s a small thing, but it’s surprisingly effective at humanizing them. I actually felt a pang of guilt when I accidentally ran someone down and then saw that they were on the waiting list for a liver transplant, and as a result this is one of the few open-world action games where I rarely went on a violent rampage. And that had very little to do with the meaningless reputation meter, which appears to have no consequences whatsoever. Over more than 20 hours, the straightforward revenge story becomes more and more complex until it’s bursting with intrigue... only to take a strange turn for the mundane when the motivations behind it all are revealed. For a game that deals with themes like surveillance society and media manipulation, Watch Dogs’ villains just aren’t thinking very big.  It can last a lot longer than 20 hours though, because Watch Dogs is extremely good at distracting attention away from the main story with a steady stream of side quests and minigames. I’m a big fan of the gang hideout missions, which really let you test your stealth skills as you take down well-guarded targets (though it’s kinda strange that they ask you to keep the gang leader alive but are cool with murdering everyone else). Most of the other activities can get repetitive, like the pre-crime interventions that always result in the same foot chase, but there are so many types, from criminal convoy ambushes to chess and poker to drinking, that they don’t get old quickly if you mix up what you play. Oh, and the simple but delightful Spider Tank rampage shouldn’t be missed. There was definitely some tender love and care put into the way that monstrosity moves.  I admire Ubisoft’s restraint in including only one hacking puzzle minigame in a game about an uberhacker hero, and it’s both clever and used infrequently enough that it doesn’t become annoying. There’s also the ability to take over any surveillance camera you can see, even some worn by guards, and it’s put to good use in puzzles where you leap from camera to camera as you attempt to get line of sight on a terminal you want to hack. Unless you opt out, you’re also regularly prompted to jump into multiplayer activities, like a simple race through the streets or a much more interesting cat-and-mouse game of tailing and hacking another random player. It’s a setup with a lot of room for creativity and hilarious experimentation as you try to hide or blend in with the civilians. There’s also the highly entertaining capture-the-flag style Decryption game, where one player desperately tries to evade the rest, and a challenging race where you have to evade traps and cops triggered by a player using the free iPad app.  Watch Dogs’ missions are much more stealth-focused than most open-world action games, which gives them some good variety. A smooth cover system and the obligatory time-slowing power (it seems like everybody can slow down time these days) make silenced headshots easy to score, and the wet splattering sound it produces is a great, gross reward. I do wish there were fewer missions that auto-fail you if you’re discovered, and that there were better rewards for using gadgets like the powerful blackout tool (knocking out the power in the area is kind of a stealth nuke) to ghost through an area without being spotted or knocking anyone out. The best missions give you the option to stealth or fight through, and that makes Aiden feel smarter than a typical guns-blazing maniac. After the bullets do start to fly, the cover-based gunplay feels good, even if the arsenal is pretty conventional. The standout is the pump-action grenade launcher, which makes short work of both thugs in armor and vehicles (it’s essential for taking out fleeing hackers in multiplayer). What often makes the firefights in Watch Dogs memorable is how you can fool enemies by moving around behind cover, causing them to fire at your last known position instead of where you are now. That allows you to get in some good flanking moves, and makes the enemies feel more like foolish humans than all-seeing robots.  When you get in a car and drive, Watch Dogs is some good arcadey fun. Cartoonish crash physics and roads littered with tons of breakable objects make smashing through shortcuts spectacular and hilarious. However, car chases gradually become more and more disappointing  and tedious because of their lack of combat options. You can’t fire out the window as you drive, so all you can do is drive around hacking things to trigger hazards. Half the time you don’t even see the car or trap involved in the wreck. And enemy cars are so rubber-bandy that it’s impossible to simply outrun them even in the speediest of cars - you have to hack things to end the chase.   Xbox One Version The slightly lower resolution is the only noticeable difference between the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of Watch Dogs, and I doubt I’d have picked up on it if I hadn’t just come from playing the PS4 version. I did quickly disable the trigger vibrations in the options menu -- they appear to happen when your car shifts gears (which is automatic), which I found to be useless and distracting feedback.   Xbox 360 Version Naturally the Xbox 360 version doesn't look as nice as the newer generation consoles when it comes to texture resolution, physics objects like debris and smoke, and draw distance, but it does look respectable for a game on this platform in 2014. More importantly, it runs consistently, avoiding the major performance problems that drag down the PlayStation 3 version. The only notable differences content-wise are the disappointing lack of the Decryption multiplayer mode and the multiplayer free-roam mode, but those absences don't make me recommend it any less for those who don't own a PS4 or Xbox One.    PC Version I had quite a rant written about how busted the PC version of Watch Dogs was at launch, with both Uplay issues that prevented me from playing at all for the first two days and massive stuttering problems even on low settings making it nearly unplayable on two different PCs once I did. I was mere hours from posting a review on Sunday with a greatly reduced score attached when a patch resolved most of my performance problems. [Note: I can only assume there was a stealth patch, since it simply started running well where it had not before.] Watch Dogs on PC still isn't a fantastically well optimized game, but my nearly four-year-old GTX 570 is able to deliver over 30fps (sometimes over 60) on medium settings. I do experience a few dropped frames here and there, but as of this writing it's otherwise just as good as the PS4 version (better, if you've got newer hardware) and just as easy to recommend. Naturally you do have to suffer through the inconvenience of Ubisoft's Uplay login nonsense, and Aiden's smartphone menu system is a pain to navigate with the mouse.   One-button hacking might be overly simplistic, but it does give you abilities that make playing through Aiden’s story feel powerful and fun. Doing side missions and multiplayer as you make your way through the dark and lengthy story makes it feel like a huge adventure, and stealth options let you play smart if you prefer. Car chases aside, Watch Dogs is fundamentally very well made, and has more than enough unique ideas to make it a great and memorable open-world action game.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	" ""What if the Nazis won World War II?"" is probably the single most-asked alternate history question, and it makes sense why. Wars are often fought over conflicting viewpoints, opposite goals, and a muddy sense of what's right and wrong, but when it came to the Third Reich, the world saw the face of actual evil through its Master Race propaganda, expansionist military campaigns, and systematic extermination of millions upon millions of people. But not all alternate history World War II shooters are cut from quality cloth (I'm looking at you, Turning Point: Fall of Liberty). Wolfenstein: The New Order is a fun game not because it takes place in a well-worn, fictional Nazi-controlled future, but because it does something fresh with the subject matter. Its barrage of Swastikas, Iron Crosses, and Sig Runes is the stuff of many like-minded first-person shooters; its content is something entirely different, even if its core gameplay isn't.  In The New Order, Nazi Germany didn't only win World War II; it completely dominates the globe. By 1960, the Nazis are everywhere, laying waste to their remaining opponents while cleansing the impure from society. Walking into a setting I've seen so many times before, I didn't expect the high level of polish applied to Wolfenstein's exceptional writing. Cutscenes are especially riddled with little touches that made them more believable -- the twirling of a character's thumbs as he speaks, the subtle ashing of a cigarette, the nuance of rolled eyes -- and there are relatable heroes to pull for and devilish villains to wish the worst upon alike. The Wolfenstein series' longtime hero -- BJ Blazcowicz -- returns, though he's deeper, better written, and more fleshed-out than he's ever been. You catch a glimpse of him 14 years before the events of the main campaign in a shockingly weak intro sequence that takes forever to put an actual gun in your hand, and at that point, he's more unrelenting meathead than poet laureate. But when you fast-forward to 1960, Blazcowicz is older and smarter, hardened by his experiences in the post-war, Nazi-controlled world. You get to see an interesting side to him that makes it easy to become invested in his journey, and he's not the only character who's worth noting, either. Virtually everyone around him -- from the fiendish General Deathshead to the brave Caroline Becker -- also command attention. Wolfenstein's bloody brutality, especially when it comes to those Blazcowicz loves, only makes it easier to be sympathetic. The New Order plays and runs well, though you'll encounter occasional texture pop-in and some poor audio mixing that frustratingly drowns out some well-acted voices. It's pretty, too, both in-game and during cutscenes, especially when you get a chance to marvel at some of its open vistas and cityscapes. Neo-Berlin is frighteningly beautiful in its order and grandeur, yet quainter, picturesque moments can also be found out in the wilderness, for instance when Blazcowicz escapes from a hospital in Poland early in the campaign and gets his first look at the blue sky in 14 years. Is that a metal dog? Why yes. Yes it is. Then again, when it comes to mechanics, The New Order doesn't do much to differentiate itself from the glut of shooters that come out every year. Blazcowicz has a typical array of weapons at his disposal -- a knife, a pistol, a machinegun, a sniper rifle, and so on -- as well as some Nazi future tech, like laser rifles, that give the game the alternate history feel that Wolfenstein has thrived on for 22 years. Gunplay is fun and fluid, though I have to question the inclusion of dual-wielding, which, while cool in theory, is exceptionally cumbersome and entirely inadequate in heated firefights. Combat is made more dynamic by a heavy emphasis on stealth, which is both a blessing and a curse in The New Order. Slinking around wide-open maps and linear corridors -- knife in hand -- is satisfying, especially when you score a stealthy kill with a slash or toss of your blade or the shot of a silenced pistol. I also enjoyed the inclusion of special enemies with the ability to call endless reinforcements if you're spotted. By finding and killing them in secret, you can mitigate the challenges presented by specific areas while illuminating the locations of secret items on your map (like gold, Enigma codes, and letters). It's just a shame that these stealth mechanics expose some questionable and inconsistent AI that seems designed to make things a bit easier on you if you opt to play with a quiet slant. Sometimes it seems blind, both to you and to the freshly knifed bodies of their compatriots under their feet.  Developer Machinegames did bring some novelty to the experience, however, especially when it comes to The New Order's skill progression system. It isn't based on leveling up or spending skill points; rather, dozens of skills are nestled underneath four separate headers, and they're unlocked by completing tasks in-game, like scoring headshots, killing foes from cover, or eliminating your enemies with potato masher grenades. Better yet, many of these skills must be unlocked in sequence, giving the entire scheme some depth. I really liked this system; it feels genuinely unique next to many of Wolfenstein's shooter contemporaries. The New Order has a wide array of environments to explore that highlight some what-ifs of a victorious Nazi Germany. In Wolfenstein, the Nazis have a thriving space program, devastating ordnance, and an all-new, gilded version of their capital city, Berlin. Some of these areas seem a little vacant when it comes to foot and car traffic, but it's cool to see Machinegames' vision of this terrible new fascist-dominated world. Unfortunately, scouring these environments can sometimes be a bit of a grind, especially when you're constantly collecting endless amounts of health, armor, and ammunition, each of which requiring the press of a button. Oftentimes, I'd see the on-screen prompt to collect something before I could even see what I'm collecting, taking away from the immersive nature of the world. Why can't I just pick up the ammo by walking over it? This aspect of The New Order made it feel very old. The Nazis have been inventing some pretty crazy machines... Where The New Order really shines, however, is in its plot, characters, and presentation. It's swimming in cool, alternate history lore that makes Wolfenstein feel strangely believable. While the Nazis didn't actually build large, building-sized machines, affix plate armor to their dogs, or implant human brains into mechs, it's honestly not that far-fetched to think they might have tried if the Allies didn't extinguish them in 1945. These are the people that performed heinous experiments on living humans, obsessed over racial purity with their Ahnenerbe-affiliated pseudo-scholars, and even contemplated building something called the Sun Gun, not to mention endless arrays of special missiles, nuclear bombs, jet aircraft, helicopters, and more under the moniker of Wunderwaffe. That's all real, so it's not too farfetched to think that if Nazi scientists in the real world were experimenting with, say, bone and nerve transplants, that they might have eventually tried to do it with the human brain, too. Wolfenstein seems to understand this, even if it's taken to a still unrealistic degree. Machinegames should also be commended for artfully working unsanitized references to real-life Nazi atrocities into its alternate history story without fear of offending anybody. You're given startling glimpses into Nazi's systematic mistreatment of the mentally ill and handicapped, a first-hand look at a forced labor camp, and plenty of allusions to Nazi treatment of non-Aryan people around the world, including in occupied America. All of this, peppered into in-game and pre-rendered cutscenes, makes The New Order feel surprisingly human, and your situation quite desperate.   The so-called ""last-gen"" iterations of Wolfenstein: The New Order -- on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 -- are identical in content to the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PC versions of the game. They play virtually identically, too. However, there are a few technical issues and hiccups worth noting. The New Order on both PS3 and Xbox 360 looks noticeably rougher compared to their next-gen counterparts. No surprise there. Additionally, both have texture pop-in issues, issues which are especially noticeable in tight spaces (like during the intro sequence, for instance). On PlayStation 3, I had to install the game on two separate machines. On the first PS3 I tried (a ""fat"" model), the game didn't contain any spoken audio. I uninstalled and reinstalled the game; the same thing happened. On the second PS3 I installed it on (also a ""fat"" model), it worked fine. So, this is likely due to hardware, but it's worth noting, nonetheless. Both the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions require substantial installs, so make sure to clear around 10 gigs of space on your console. And while the PlayStation 3 version is on a single Blu-ray disc, the Xbox 360 iteration is on four separate discs, which seems a little excessive, to put it lightly.   Wolfenstein: The New Order is the melding of your typical, everyday shooter with quality writing and a cast of believable and relatable characters. Machinegames' more grounded treatment of the often way over-the-top alternate Nazi history is also a nice touch, and while The New Order is in no way, shape, or form a simulation of the real world, its 10-to-12 hour campaign can certainly make you stop and wonder more than, say, Raven's 2009's occult-centric Wolfenstein reboot. With an essential early-game choice that makes it worth playing through twice, the story at the center of Wolfenstein: The New Order props up its competent -- but mostly unremarkable -- shooting."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/14/super-time-force-review	" Old-school throwbacks have been en vogue for several years now, so it's always refreshing to play a retro-inspired game whose claim to fame isn't ""I look like I belong on the NES!"" but rather ""look at the new ideas I bring to the table!"" Super Time Force is one such game, a nostalgia-infused side-scrolling shooter imbued with a fresh, inspired mechanic. Then again, while that mechanic is novel, it doesn't always play out quite as planned. Super Time Force isn't only about shooting bad guys, but about manipulating the very fabric of spacetime. You're given 30 lives per stage and are ultimately encouraged to die, die, and die again, because here, lives simply aren't that precious. What's more important is speed. You only have 60 seconds to get through each level, and maximizing not only time spent -- but lives used -- is the name of the game. You simply can't play Super Time Force in a conventional way. You really need to use your noggin, something about the experience of playing it that I adored. You may have died, but now you can be saved in an alternate timeline! The beauty of ripping back and forth through time while creating persistent copies of yourself is how it allows you to reinforce what you've already done while rectifying unfortunate mistakes. The way the different characters play and combine with each other adds a thick layer of strategy. You could, for instance, have Jean Rambois take down aerial foes with his spread shot, while Aimy McKillin takes rows of ground-based enemies out from behind the safety of Shieldy Blockerson’s bubble shield. This is part of Super Time Force's beauty. With over a dozen characters with unique abilities -- most of them totally hidden and up to you to find -- the combinations are seemingly (though not literally) endless. Unfortunately, this system -- while different and enjoyable -- can also be overly chaotic and utterly frustrating. I had moments of complete elation, like shaving seconds off of my time with some clever rewinding and reworking, or figuring out some new, epic combination of characters that did exactly what I needed them to do. But there were other moments where I would respawn into bullets without realizing it or run into an enemy after a split-second of being on-screen. Chaos is in Super Time Force's blood, and it's unfortunate how it inherently conflicts with being able to play it cleanly. Unlike so many old-school classics, Super Time Force lacks something very significant: elegance. You can play it astutely -- in fact, you pretty much have to -- but you'll be hard-pressed to play it elegantly. I was never in danger of failing or of not being able to proceed; all I needed to do was rewind, spawn more characters, and force my way through, one way or another. This speaks to a somewhat optional component of Super Time Force, which allows you to get through the game in an incredible number of ways. It's a short, largely non-linear affair -- its six primary worlds can be played in any order, Mega Man style, and it won't take more than three hours total to beat -- but you can always backtrack to bring new characters into the mix to see if a new technique will work better than an older one. There's real depth here if you want to find it, but the challenge comes more from increasing your speed and narrowing your runtime, which will surely appeal to speedrunners, but certainly not gamers that like to do things at their own pace. A battle against time to make use of your mind. I thoroughly enjoyed Super Time Force's zany sense of humor and cast of characters, like main antagonist Dr. Infinity, who half-heartedly hides his identity by holding a tablet over his face, or Colonel Repeatski, who wears not one, but two eye patches. The dialogue is also pleasantly corny, and the plot is full of enough time travel-related paradoxes to make Stephen Hawkings' head spin. It's clear that developer Capy Games doesn't want you to walk away with even the slightest feeling that something in Super Time Force -- anything at all -- is actually serious. And that's a good thing. I enjoyed playing Super Time Force. It was refreshing to experience something truly different, even in the well-worn territory of the old-school. I was especially impressed by its dedication to its strange and novel mechanic, one that makes it so much more than yet another retro-inspired side-scroller. Still, Super Time Force's strength is also its weakness, and the chaos inherent in its time traveling mechanics caused its share of unavoidable frustration. Throughout the three hour campaign, I was never able to develop a rhythm without finding something to be annoyed at, even after playing parts of it a second time. I love what it's trying to do -- and I'd recommend playing it -- but I also can't help but wonder if it's everything it could have been. In fact, I'm certain that it isn't."
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/30/the-amazing-spider-man-2-game-review	 The Amazing Spider-Man 2 game feels like what would happen if you found a cursed monkey's paw and wished for the best web-slinging experience ever. For all the fun you can have swinging around New York City, it’s canceled out by boring Peter Parker segments, frustratingly dull combat, and annoyingly persistent glitches. Meanwhile, plot is tossed aside in favor of churning out an unsatisfying parade of supervillains.  Traversal is much-improved from 2012’s Amazing Spider-Man game. Your web lines have to actually attach to a nearby building or structure, so you're encouraged to swing close to the ground where taxis and other vehicles honk as you narrowly miss them. It’s much more fun than flying high above them on webs apparently attached to clouds. Having the left and right triggers (or mouse buttons) mapped to swinging with their respective arms is a nice addition, too; the ability to alternate adds a tad more authenticity to Spidey's wild and fast swinging, as does cutting around a corner by using the inside arm. The first time I made a crazy dive from a skyscraper and attached a web to a building right before hitting the ground, I could finally relate to the common scene that’s played out in just about every Spider-Man movie over the last dozen years. I never wanted to stop moving in The Amazing Spider-Man 2. Adding to that feeling is that things aren't much fun once you slow down. Like the last movie tie-in, The Amazing Spider-Man 2 attempts to be Arkham-lite when it comes to combat, and fails due to its repetitive nature. While Spidey's range for stealth attacks has been increased, that benefit is negated by the guesswork involved in discovering said range, since there is no indicator like in The Amazing Spider-Man. When you're inevitably discovered, there's usually not much to winning fights: just button-mash the attack button until your Spidey-sense tingles, then dodge or counter. If you need to slow an enemy down, spam them with webbing. It lacks the options that make Batman’s combat interesting. The sub-par enemy AI comes to light whenever you Web Dash just a few feet away from a thug. That’ll often confound lesser foes, even the ones that accompany bosses. When enemies aren't easily confused, they're straight-up broken; you can expect multiple occurrences of thugs walking into walls or bosses that glitch into game-breaking states. This either renders them completely open to attack or indefinitely invincible, requiring a restart. Missions in The Amazing Spider-Man 2 are significantly shorter than its predecessor’s, but the running time is roughly the same seven hours due to undesirable padding. The combat lead-up to a boss battle is actually pretty short – more often than not, you have to clear a single (albeit large) room of enemies before progressing to the supervillan. It takes about 15 minutes to beat one, but you’ll have spent another 15 during that mission slowly walking around taking photos and searching for items as Peter Parker. The biggest affront in this added time is the “interactive” dialogue sequences. These are consequence-free choices that just determine the order in which questions are asked.  Not that it really matters. Where the movies at least make an effort to give you nuanced introductions and unique team-ups, this bland plot throws just about every single one of the seven supervillans into the fray individually and without fanfare, particularly at the end. It certainly doesn’t help that the script is very schizophrenic, jumping from attempted melodrama to hackneyed gags a matter of seconds. You can unlock more backstory via side-missions, but they're rarely worth the effort. Nevertheless, you will have to tackle them on occasion, since there are a few instances where the only requirement to progress in a mission is “explore the city.” The only good ones are the Russian mob hideouts, which are always just the right length and unlock cool new costumes. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is available for all major platforms, but outside of the unflinching framerate, which stays steady no matter how fast Spidey swings, I wasn’t all that impressed by its looks on PC or newer consoles. On the Wii U, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360, the hardware is able to keep pace with a few graphical concessions. The biggest difference is the ground traffic in New York City, where the rush hour of more powerful platforms turns into 3AM Tuesday midtown traffic on the older systems. Across the board, though, there are a few low-budget stylistic choices unbecoming of a blockbuster movie adaptation, like the lack of lip syncing in the intros and the static news screens that accompany the outros of petty crime side-missions. In addition to Off-TV Play, the Wii U version places the map on the GamePad, but it’s really not much of a boon, as it’s zoomed in and doesn’t respond to touch. If you want to see outside the five-to-six block radius or drop a beacon, you’ll have to pause and access Spidey’s phone menu as you’d do in every other version. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 is yet another example of what happens when games are rushed out to coincide with a movie release date. It’s especially frustrating because the web swinging really is fun, but developer Beenox wasn’t able to keep the momentum going once you hit the ground. The next time there's an Amazing Spider-Man movie, hopefully combat can be brought up to snuff, since there's plenty of promise in the air.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	 Elegance. It's a word I've rarely found applicable where video games are concerned, but there's no better way to describe what Ubisoft has achieved with Child of Light. With its earthy, hand-painted art style and charming character designs, it deftly sidesteps the tropey land mines that have littered the RPG landscape for the better part of a decade. Yet it still pays loving homage to what's come before it with enjoyable exploration and puzzle solving, and a combat system that's second to none. The intelligent simplicity with which it's been crafted makes it both easy to grasp, and rewarding to master in a way that very few RPGs can match.  From one screen to the next, Child of Light commits fully to its hand-crafted aesthetic. Each stunning, water-color backdrop looks ready to be framed and hung in an art gallery. That's not strictly because of the high level of overall quality, but also due to how warm the characters and environments all feel. Dark silhouettes of gnarled, ancient trees scroll through the foreground, adding a sense of depth to painterly forests, and oppressively dreary caverns give way to towering windmills amidst rolling hillsides.Each area possesses a rare, naturalistic beauty that words honestly fail to capture. The endearing, if slightly forced Shakespearean iambic pentameter reinforces the fairytale sensibilities of the plot, but it also kept me from getting fully absorbed in the characters. There’s a travelling jester who can’t figure out how rhyming works, a love-sick mouse archer, and most importantly, a young girl named Aurora who’s trying to save her father rather than the other way around. None of them adhere to the overly worn, widely accepted conventions of powerful men and sexualized women, and the motley cast is all the more memorable for it. Aurora’s transformation from a frightened child to the hero of her own story is framed relatably by filial strife, making her journey feel deeply personal despite the broad strokes it’s painted with. This feeling of warmth and sentimentality can be seen in every aspect of Child of Light, from the character portraits in the menus, to the lovingly detailed hit animations in battle. The net result is an experience that feels less like a power fantasy, and more like the cherished memory of a childhood bedtime story. Some modern RPGs suffer by either abandoning too much of the choice and depth that first made the genre interesting, or by piling on needless, bloated systems that don't add anything to the experience. Child of Light makes neither of these mistakes, striking a near-perfect balance across each facet of its gameplay.  Its biggest success is the combat system, which skillfully mixes turn-based and real-time elements. Icons move along a bar at the bottom of the screen, indicating when you and your opponents get to act next. Scoring hits on an enemy who's winding up for a big spell interrupts them, canceling their move, and sending them back on the timeline. This creates a constant tension, forcing me to plan two steps ahead while looking for chances to interrupt, and keeping enemies from doing the same. That fusion of big-picture planning, and second-to-second awareness kept me feeling like a tactical genius battle after battle. A village of crows? Your spritely helper Igniculus also plays a vital role in combat. You (or a friend in co-op) control him independently with the right stick, slowing down foes, healing allies, and grabbing health and mana pickups when necessary. You’re doing all this while switching characters in and out of the fray to capitalize on their assortment of well-tuned spells and abilities. Enemy encounters, especially the boss fights, are balanced tightly around the tools you've been given, so while the tool box isn't huge, every piece of hardware has an application. Armor spells actually add a noticeable amount of survivability, and crowd control abilities like Hinder, and paralyze work 100% of the time, even against bosses. Every card in the deck feels like an ace when you use it at the right moment. Shining in the darkness... Even great RPGs struggle to make what happens between scraps interesting, but Child of Light nails this too. Giving us the ability to fly almost right away is a smart touch, one that invited me to explore constantly for mini-boss encounters, side-quests, and collectibles. Igniculus proves useful here again, helping you solve puzzles, stunning enemies, and lighting your way through dark caverns. Granted, most of this will look and feel familiar to RPG veterans, but it all worked well enough to hold my attention outside of combat. Like everything else in the 12ish-hour-long adventure, it does just enough to be engaging without feeling cluttered or ungainly. Every aspect of Child of Light has an unmistakably artisinal, organic feel to it. None of it feels focus-tested, or designed to appeal to the broadest possible audience; rather, it always comes off as exactly the expression its creators intended. The artwork on display is stunning, and the combat is constantly engaging, and the characters openly defy genre convention. But perhaps the best thing I can say about Child of Light is that I was often unsure as to whether I was headed in the direction I was supposed to, and I never once cared. I just wanted to fly to every corner of the world, take it in, and smile.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/16/trials-fusion-review	 In today's age of broad design intended to reach the widest possible audience, games like Trials Fusion are a precious rarity. Its simple, yet uncompromisingly precise mechanics cater beautifully to staunch perfectionists. But for as technically demanding as it is, it still provides enough character, freedom, and rhythm to entertain on a moment-to-moment basis. Though some of its course designs err on the side of the sadistic, the pain melts away every time you nail one of the many colossal jumps.  Trials Fusion borrows elements of platforming and motocross, then injects a concentrated shot of highly believable physics. Each bike, and the one ATV, has a distinct weight to it, and you’ll feel the differences every time you feather the throttle. The lightweight, powerful Pit Viper will lurch right out from under you if you pin the accelerator from a stand-still, and the acrobatic Fox Bat tumbles through the air end over end at your slightest suggestion. Each input translates smoothly and accurately through your bike and rider, creating a rare sense of direct connection. The physics behind the riding implies a simulation, but the dystopia-tinged tracks look and play like something straight out of an arcade quarter muncher. You’ll ride over the backs of blimps floating high above skyscrapers, barrel through overgrown jungle ruins, and skip lithely from one set of solar panels to the next. Despite the variety of climates and locales, there’s a real sense of place here, a sense further emphasized by the quips of the two AI announcers, whose well-delivered voice overs provide a darkly humorous context for why anyone would ride, repeatedly, into near-certain doom. And oh is your doom ever certain. Fusion starts simple enough, with laid-back jumps comfortably separated by long, mellow ramps. By about midway through, sticking landings on the downslope of a jump and getting your rear wheel down first become minimum requirements, and the last two sets of tracks are on another level entirely. Intricate understanding of bunny-hopping, momentum, and weight distribution are needed on nearly every checkpoint. This can lead to either ecstatic celebration when you reach the next waypoint by the skin of your teeth, or crushing heartbreak when you wipe out inches shy of the finish line.It’s rare for any game to reward this level of comprehension and mastery.  But while that’s commendable, it also makes for some slavish track designs. The sense of spectacle eventually gives way to an endless series of small scale, highly technical challenges that break up the rhythmic sense of joy that defines the experience until then. It’s oddly anti-climactic for the later levels to feel smaller, and slower than what precedes them. Fusion’s high difficulty kept me engaged, but I wish those later levels had retained the big thrills while ramping up the challenge. Besides nailing its core mechanic, Trials Fusion also offers scads of content. In addition to over 40 standard tracks, and the assortment of enjoyable skill games like Triathalon and Krank, there’s also a bunch of of tracks specifically designed to use the new FMX trick system to its fullest. You’d almost never want to pull one of these slickly animated grabs and holds off  in a timed run (unless you want to show off in local multiplayer), but they’re a fun addition that calls on the detailed physics just as much as the rest of the riding does.  Every standard track sports four medals to grab, in addition to three optional challenges that require you to perform tricks, no-fault runs, or find paths so well-hidden, I honestly never saw one. All of it gives you money and XP to unlock cool new looks for your bikes and riders. Perfecting my runs, and finding ways to shave seconds off my time became an obsession, especially with leader boards so readily accessible. Topping it all off is a powerful track creator with an incredible number of objects and options to tweak. It’s not exactly user-friendly, but it should ensure a constant stream of new tracks to master for some time to come. Trials Fusion is at once mercilessly exacting, and regularly thrilling. It allows you to exert an impressive level of control over your rider, and leverages that control to create nuanced, challenging tracks that beg to be run, and re-run until perfection is attained. The later levels lose some of the over-the-top fun of the earlier ones, but overall, Trials Fusion offers a fun, deeply challenging experience with lots to see and do.
Steve Butts	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/10/lego-the-hobbit-review	 To the great surprise of no one, the Lego games are finally going there and, well, not quite back again in Lego The Hobbit. The game follows the first two films of the Hobbit movie trilogy, giving us a chance to lead Bilbo and company all the way from the comforts of Bag End to the dwarf home beneath the Lonely Mountain. It’s a fun journey to be sure, but confusing at times, and not entirely satisfying. An Unexpected Party Lego The Hobbit clings to the series’ standard combat and exploration, but, as usual, a handful of welcome twists make things a bit more interesting this time around. A few different rhythm-based challenges, an item creation system tied to resource collection, and the “find the missing piece” mini-game from February’s Lego Movie game make The Hobbit more than just a button masher, although it is still mostly just that. Thankfully, the environmental challenges and enemies are sophisticated enough to keep the action engaging. In comparison to the roster in last year’s Lego Marvel game, many of the characters in the Hobbit feel like, at best, minor variations of each other. It certainly doesn’t help that they all sort of look alike, and it can get a little confusing to tell the dwarves apart. But you’ll need to pay attention, as each dwarf has one unique ability, like Bombur’s ability to turn into a bouncing platform or Bofur’s mining power, that needs to be applied to the narrowly scripted environmental challenges.  Chip the Glasses and Crack the Plates The extended action sequences and sometimes slapstick humor of The Hobbit films make a good fit for a Lego game. Honestly, there’s always been something a little disjointed about watching Cyclops wreck the X-Mansion or Luke Skywalker destroy Yoda’s house, but seeing the Dwarves go to town demolishing absolutely everything in Bag End or Rivendell makes perfect sense. When you see them literally start smashing Bilbo’s cupboards and Elrond’s tables, it just feels right. From the plate juggling in Bilbo’s kitchen to the golden toilets in Smaug’s hoard, there are also loads of humorous little touches that keep the charm going. Lego The Hobbit also looks beautiful. The settings are very convincing, with loads of little details and plenty of suitably moody lighting.  The world is filled with fantastic creatures and monsters, and developer Traveller’s Tales has done a great job adapting the giant eagles, goblin kings, and dragons to the standard Lego models. The only real problem with the graphics is that the more realistic color palette and sheer density of some of the scenes can make it very difficult to see who you are or what you’re doing. The sometimes inconsistent camera angles don’t help things much. More than once, I just found myself just attacking and jumping at random in the hopes that I would eventually figure out where I was.   To Dungeons Deep and Caverns Old The main story clocks in at about six hours, but there’s much more to do and see in the world once you’ve completed the main missions. Each mission unlocks events around the map, and you’ll be able to spend hours digging into the recipes, errands, and encounters around Middle-earth. A campfire system lets you change the time of day to open up new events, and you can always call on a giant eagle to get you from one end of the map to the other. While most of the missions are fairly predictable, I was impressed with the Hobbit’s take on the solo sections. For Riddles in the Dark, Bilbo’s joined by a dazed goblin, for instance. There are also some tremendous set pieces where the characters are facing off against the dragon, or climbing up the body of a very active and very angry stone giant. Unfortunately, the story sort of goes by in a flash. Last year’s Lego Marvel showed what Travelers Tales can do with an original story, so The Hobbit’s abbreviated, sometimes scattered storytelling feels like a step back. There are narrative bits tying the missions together, but the whole game presumes that you already know the source material well enough to fill in the gaps yourself. (You probably do, but if you’re playing with kids it might not be clear to them.) It’s particularly troublesome to track the events between the spider attack and the dwarves’ arrival at Lake Town. The game also ends where the second movie ends, which left me wanting more – and not in a good way. Lego The Hobbit won’t surprise fans of the Lego series, but the new gameplay systems add just enough complexity to keep things interesting. New events and mining opportunities make exploration of the open world almost as fun as the main missions. The storytelling presumes you already know the source material by heart, which means things are sometimes a bit disjointed, and the game, like the movies it’s based on, ends at an awkward place. But like almost all the Lego games, this is a journey worth taking.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/07/kinect-sports-rivals-review	" ""Does the Kinect stuff work well?"" That's the question that matters most for Kinect Sports Rivals. The sports, the leaderboards, -- it's all for nothing if the main motions of swinging a racket or scaling a cliff don't feel good. Fortunately, they do, most of the time. Kinect Sports Rivals' six games, from sharp shooting to wave racing, are fun and generally control well, but some, like soccer, trip over motion controls too often to forgive. I like how Kinect Sports Rivals blows past the pomp and circumstance of menu wading and goal setting that other fitness games often get lost in. It's not that playing with a larger goal in mind is bad, but that can wait until I've had some fun first. Within minutes, Kinect scanned my face, and a surprisingly accurate version of myself appeared on screen. After a few tweaks (my haircut was silly), I jumped in and started learning the fundamentals of Jet Ski racing. A few minutes later I was dodging mines and doing flips like a champ.   Wave racing in particular controls very well, and I was surprised at how accurately the Kinect read my hand motions. Open your hand to let off the gas, make a fist to go faster, and turn by moving your hands like they’re attached to handlebars. Even on more challenging levels, I was able to dodge obstacles and keep up with the competition through skill alone. My personal favorite was the rock climbing game. The motion of reaching out to grab a ledge, closing my hand to grab, then pulling my hand down to my side to lift myself up is natural and easy to get the hang of. It sounds simple, and it is… until the traps come. I encountered electrified grips, wind gusts, and AI competitors who grabbed my ankles and ripped me from the cliff. Seeing someone creep up behind you, their hand only a few inches away from your feet, is a strong motivator to hurry up. Of the six minigames, this one felt most like its own thought-out game, and the Kinect was almost never frustrating. Motion-controlled tennis and bowling are pretty much the same as the popular, original Wii Sports versions, but by enabling me to use techniques from real bowling, Kinect Sports Rivals brings more depth. Putting spin on a bowling ball seems like it might be too slight a movement for a Kinect sensor to track, but for me it worked almost every time. Cleaning up the lane for a spare feels great, especially when I took time to line up my shots and add a tactical twist. Tennis is equally nuanced. For example, when the opponent rushes up to the net, I'm able to reliably lob the ball over his or her head, which feels skillful. However, when I played alongside a friend, our movements weren’t translated onto the screen quite as reliably. We had to start swinging a tad earlier than what felt natural. It’s a shame, because playing along with friends is a huge draw of Kinect Sports Resort. It just doesn’t feel like the tech can handle multiple players with quite the same accuracy.   Kinect Sports Rivals’ soccer game is the biggest disappointment. It's more like a big game of foosball than soccer, where some teammates are difficult to pass to, but it's worth trying because pulling it off powers up your final goal shot. I do like the idea on paper, as a full on soccer game probably wouldn't translate well to Kinect. The problem is that even with a calibrated Kinect in a spacious room, several of my kicks completely missed, and it felt like it wasn’t my fault. It's frustrating when I just want to kick a ball, but my character's on-screen legs are flailing around like limbs possessed. Other sports perform so well, it’s surprising that this one is so unreliable. The other two games are simpler, but they’re fun in their own ways. Sharpshooting simply required me to hold out my hand like a gun, and water skiing is sort of like riding a bike without pedaling. The focus here is definitely on earning high scores on the Kinect Sports Rivals hub leaderboards, which updates with new challenges. Kinect Sports Rivals isn’t the Kinect’s killer app, but it comes closer than anything else I’ve played. The various games, aside from soccer, feel great to play and offer more control than I expected. And even though the challenge grows in later levels, I felt like I was able to maneuver through them without fighting the controls."
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review	 As Metal Gear games go, Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes is a stripped down affair. It avoids lengthy cutscenes, climactic boss fights, and the usual frayed and tangled plot strands in favour of smart, tactical gameplay. While its central campaign is indeed as short as you might’ve heard at around two hours, its multitude of options make for an engaging and tense experience that encourages replayability for hours afterward. Besides a somewhat clumsily delivered ending, this is Metal Gear for modern tastes; lean, mean, and wickedly fun.  The prologue to the upcoming full-bodied Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain (expected in 2015), Ground Zeroes takes its structural and tonal cues from Peace Walker, 2010’s largely overlooked but wonderful PSP game. Ground Zeroes’ central plot focuses on Metal Gear’s usual concerns of high concept political conspiracies and conflicted triple agents, but contrary to the norm, there is very little of it. The plot that is here is darker in tone than what we’ve come to expect. There has been some talk of Creative Director Hideo Kojima’s desires to move Metal Gear into a grittier and more provocative territory, and the gristle and grime on display in the game's unflinching cut scenes and audio tapes certainly suggests this is the case. While I do appreciate these ambitions - particularly because the series has been known to veer into cartoonish territory - I found its ending, which features unusually provocative cruelty, to be awkwardly handled. I suspect Kojima was going for ‘heartbreaking,’ but the final blow (and I really found no issue until then) felt unearned; a “look what we dared to do!” statement shoehorned in for shock value and very little else. But the story is over quickly. When I rushed through it, I was done in less than an hour, but taking my time to smell the roses I finished it in three. The length might bother those coming to Ground Zeroes looking for a full-fledged Metal Gear game, but it does prove itself to be more than a glorified Phantom Pain tutorial with five sizeable side missions and a number of accessible and ingenious ways in which to play most of them. You just have to be ready to look for it. For the first time in a Metal Gear game, Boss’ adventure is a non-linear one, played out in the US Naval Prison Facility known as Omega Base. It’s a small sandbox, where the corridors and rooms littered with conveniently placed containers we’ve grown so familiar with have been replaced with a sprawling, functional ecosystem, full of open industrial areas and heavily populated camps surrounded by raging sea. Ground Zeroes at its most visually impressive on the PlayStation 4, but Omega Base is wonderfully realized regardless of the console you choose to play on. It’s a detailed, considered world presented sharply and cleanly, and it’s testament to its character that it feels like an entirely different locale depending on a change in weather. The central campaign’s Omega Base is a rain-soaked John Carpenter-esque isolated prison full of hidden secrets and threats, while many side-ops cast it in brutal sunlight, highlighting incredible detail on the flora and fauna but threatening to expose your every move. Picking a lock in broad daylight is a tense undertaking. Ground Zeroes is so adept at generating tension that at times it felt like I was playing a survival horror game. While Boss has never been more flexible; able to roll and jump and shoot in line with today’s top third-person action-adventure games, enemies are smart and plentiful. In the harsh light of day - and played on Hard mode - they possess cruel 20/20 vision, and react to every little movement or shifting shadow by becoming more efficacious in their patrolling. You’re given a couple of helpful technological perks to counter this: a pair of binoculars allowing you to ‘tag’ enemies to track their movements a la Far Cry, and Boss’ iDroid (it’s 1975 and Apple is apparently still ubiquitous), which aggregates your map and mission information. The binos in particular are invaluable when it comes to avoiding unexpected confrontations, but largely - and thrillingly - it’s up to you to utilise your terrain in whatever way you wish to get through the area unscathed. If you want to, you can do this all guns blazing. Ground Zeroes happily caters to more chaotic minds, and with regenerating health and a new ‘reflex’ mode that briefly slows down time when Boss is spotted allowing for a bullet to the offending head, “Shoot First, Ask Questions Later” isn’t the death sentence it was in previous games.  But take this approach, and prepare to be penalised. Stealth is still Metal Gear’s’ raison d’etre, and as per the Metal Gear norm Ground Zeroes ranks you after each mission, marking you down for every fatality and rewarding you with unlockable items and high scores for a no-kill, no-detection playthrough. While you can blunder through fairly effortlessly from beginning to end, the brutal sting of a D ranking is a reminder that you’re nothing but a second-rate soldier. In a lesser game such punishment might irritate, but Ground Zeroes offers up so many infiltration options I found the stealth approach by far the most satisfying way to play. One excellent side op, for example, challenges Boss to communicate with an undercover agent in among the rabble. Do you put everyone else to sleep with a tranq gun? Do you follow him from a distance in a vehicle, then leap out and pull him into a neck lock when his back is turned? Do you put him to sleep, before dragging him into the shadows and kicking him awake? Boss is at his most graceful when he’s darting in and out of hiding; the neck lock, tranq dart, and silent takedown become a beautifully perverted dance to both execute and watch. You'll be carrying bodies in Ground Zeroes. A lot. A couple of side op missions fall down because they encourage a louder approach. An on-rails helicopter mission that has Boss protecting an endangered VIP from above is generic, while another ‘blow up three things’ mission disintegrates into brainless action pap. I admit I found a certain catharsis in all the wanton destruction after sneaking around so much, but I was not compelled to play either mission again. Otherwise, I was happily enticed by Ground Zeroes’ world for a good eight to ten hours. Finding each ‘XOF’ patch to unlock the console-specific side missions - which are both brief, but full of nostalgic pleasure -  was a surprisingly tense and entertaining way to replay the main mission, while beating in-game trials, speed runs and finding rare unlockables became seductive prospects once I had familiarised myself with Omega Base. Score-chasers might be the only ones to find long-lasting appeal in Ground Zeroes, but there’s certainly plenty of content here to satisfy. Metal Gear Solid 5: Ground Zeroes is a short but challenging game, and those willing to cast aside conventional expectations will find a lot more here than first glance might suggest. While I’m unconvinced that Kojima is quite ready to tackle more controversial narrative material, for the most part Ground Zeroes represents a new, more sophisticated era for Metal Gear. A Big Boss/Snake adventure has never looked or played better, and in it lies incredible promise for its enormous big brother.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	 After my first few rounds of Titanfall, hearing the “Your titan is now ready” notification began to induce a Pavlovian adrenaline-rush response. I still catch myself looking up to the sky as I press down on the D-pad to call it in, because watching my 20-foot-tall robot exosuit fall onto the battlefield, seemingly from Heaven, is a glorious sight that I still see replaying when I close my eyes at night. It’s a signal that I’m about to transition from the liberating mobility of a jetpack-powered, wall-running soldier (called a pilot) to the ego-swelling walking tank that punches enemy players midair as they try to leap on its back and squashes AI-controlled minions with heavy metal feet. It’s more than a “Call of Duty with mechs” gimmick – Titanfall turns out to be an invigorating multiplayer first-person shooter that melds fresh mechanics with familiar ones, creating a new watercooler moment almost every time I play. I only wish there was more of it, and that it was easier to fight my friends.  Unlike a Call of Duty or Battlefield game, Titanfall is purely focused on its excellent 6v6 multiplayer. It cannot be played alone, except for the optional (but helpful) tutorial, or via system link – you’re completely dependent on a connection to Microsoft’s dedicated servers. There’s a laudable attempt to infuse a two-sided campaign into the multiplayer through a fixed set and order of nine of the 15 maps, in which NPC faction commanders give context to the goals and game modes of each battleground. Having played through it on both sides, though, I couldn’t tell you what it’s about, other than that the IMC and Militia factions are at war. Trying to stay alive in a brawl with human-controlled bad guys is too distracting, and without controllable lulls in the fighting, most of the story is reduced to background noise.  What’s impressive about the balance of Titanfall is that somehow, as empowering as it is to play as Goliath, David still has more than a fighting chance thanks to their many equippable abilities. Cloaking renders a soldier (called a pilot) nearly invisible to the metal giants, while the stims grant you temporary cheetah speed with which to chase them down from the ground, walls, or rooftops. One of Titanfall’s great strengths is the simplicity and natural feel of movement. Whether you’re jetpack-jumping and wall-running as a pilot, or dashing around with your titan’s lateral jets, you just aim at where you want to go and press A. You’ll never wrestle with a video game-y quick-time event or button-mashing sequence in order to execute a badass move. It always happens in the most straightforward way it can. For example, once you get in close to a titan as a pilot, a simple double-tap of the jump button from any angle allows you to maneuver up onto its shoulder, pop the cover on the titan’s head, and literally start shooting its brains out. In fact, as tense as a titan(s) vs. titan(s) showdown can be, darting into that fray as a squishy mortal can be an intoxicating mix of stupidity and genius. Of course, the titans’ counter to that move is Electric Smoke, one of many unlockable kit items you can equip your metallic avatar with as you level up. It serves as both a visibility-killing distraction – be it for flanking maneuvers or a wounded escape – and also a pilot bug-zapper that will shake off any foes who “rodeo” your titan. Each of the three archetypal titan varieties feels different and has its situational usefulness. If you prefer to go toe-to-toe, equip the Ogre with the Triple Threat grenade launcher, kit it out with the Particle Wall force field that temporarily protects you from incoming fire on one side, and you’ll pack a devastating punch. But if you do, the nimble, dash-happy Stryder can actually run circles around you, peppering you with chaingun fire and bombarding you with the cluster bomb ordnance ability as it goes. I came to prefer one extreme or the other, but the jack-of-all-trades Atlas is a bit more malleable for loadout experimentation. I find the 40mm gauss-like cannon to be a great happy medium of short and long-range combat in the Atlas, and pairing that with the rocket salvo ordnance – which locks missiles onto your target – allows it to capably throw down with both Stryders and Ogres.  Meanwhile, there are two economies behind Titanfall that are each as finely balanced as they are smart. One is the nearly ubiquitous XP-based grind that unlocks new gear and perks. By the time you reach level 50 (where you can then reset to level 1 by “regenerating,” sacrificing all of your unlocks in exchange for a faster XP-gain rate and a fancy tag in the matchmaking lobby), you’ll have many more options at your disposal – but not necessarily more inherently powerful ones. An anti-titan grenade launcher is certainly a different tool with which to try bringing down the big guys when on foot, but it’s not fundamentally superior to the Sidewinder rocket launcher you have available from level 1. Progression in Titanfall brings more options than advantages, even when factoring in the “burn cards” – single-use perks that last the duration of one life, earned for completing various baked-in challenges and scenarios. For instance, one card might grant you unlimited frag grenades. Another could reduce your titan build time by a whopping 40 seconds. Burn cards can tip the scales in battle when played correctly, but they never turn you into a demigod. And in today’s microtransaction-obsessed world, I have to commend developer Respawn for resisting the urge to charge us for them (or anything else in Titanfall). The other economy fuels the titan delivery system in each match. Killing the multiple classes of utterly braindead AI-controlled minions that fill out Titanfall’s conflicts shaves a couple seconds off of your titan deployment timer, while offing pilots hastens it even more. Felling titans, of course, gets you into your mech the quickest. The sooner you’re able to get your titan back on the battlefield, the more powerful you become. And yet, you’re never invulnerable. So while it may seem like the AI soldiers are worthless fodder that rarely pose a threat, they do play a valuable role.  Notice a theme here? Balance. Titanfall’s weapons, abilities, and gameplay systems all play together very nicely. Every action has a counter-action, and every weapon and ability a strategic use. The auto-targeting Smart Pistol, for instance, is my favorite sidearm since the Halo 1 pistol, but its relatively limited range and need to get a three to five-second lock-on leaves you vulnerable to counterattack and keeps it from feeling cheap. Besides its balance, map variety is what will give Titanfall its legs. The 15 battlefields range in quality from very good to great. The desert-y “Boneyard” falls into the former category – its distinctive ziplines accelerate map traversal while flying dragon-like creatures provide intimidating set dressing, but sadly cannot be interacted with. The tiny village “Colony,” on the other hand, is among Titanfall’s best maps. On it, tightly packed houses make trading bullets while jumping from one angled rooftop to another an experience wholly unlike the action happening on the ground or in the wide-open, titan-friendly perimeter. Technically speaking, those battles look impressive, but my eyeballs remain un-melted. Titans, pilots, maps, and weapon effects are all perfectly acceptable, save for the occasional dip below the otherwise-normal 60 frames per second in a huge multi-titan explosion or the ugly talking head of your faction leader before you exit your dropship at the start of a match. The omission of split-screen play is perhaps an unfortunate side effect of keeping things running smoothly.   Xbox 360 Version Delightfully, the Xbox 360 version of Titanfall plays just as fast and (almost) as fluid as its Xbox One and PC counterparts. Every map, mode, and feature is here, right down to – perhaps most importantly – its lag-free dedicated servers. As expected, Titanfall on Xbox 360 has much lower-quality textures than the Xbox One or PC editions. But by 360 standards it doesn’t look half bad, although it’s nowhere near the prettiest shooter on the platform, and it does suffer from very noticeable texture pop-in, particularly when a titan drops in. However, the action moves so fast that it stopped bothering me very quickly. Similarly, load times seem a touch quicker than on Xbox One, even though you can’t install the whole game to your hard drive (a 1GB install is mandatory, however). Meanwhile, the Xbox 360 version offers up an interesting choice in its options menu: whether or not to lock the framerate at 30fps. I preferred to do so, rather than have it fluctuate between what appears to be the 30s and 40s, sometimes causing screen tearing. The capped framerate makes Titanfall feel just as good as Halo in the smoothness department.    All of the maps adapt very well to each of Titanfall’s game modes, but that’s largely due to how they’re mostly slight variations on the strong main concept. Last Titan Standing issues everyone a titan from the get-go and makes teamwork and flanking strategies essential, while the threat of titans carrying the flag crowns CTF as an especially appealing team exercise. Attrition is point-based team deathmatch, making use of the aforementioned enemy-pecking-order economy, while Hardpoint Domination is like Battlefield’s Conquest and myriad other similar modes over the years. And then there’s Pilot Hunter, which is identical to Attrition except that destroying titans carries no payoff if the pilot can safely eject before detonation, because your team only earns points for killing pilots. And… that’s it. Titanfall is going to need some new, spicier game modes, stat. Its far graver online sin, especially considering its online-only focus, is its lack of private matches. (Respawn promises to deliver those “soon” in a free update.) Despite the fact that Halo 2 wrote the blueprint for this a decade ago, Titanfall does not allow 12 friends to gather in a lobby and play together on the game type, map, and options of their choosing. The best you can do is a party of six, where you’re still stuck warring against online strangers with no say in what map you’ll fight on. This is unforgivable in a modern multiplayer shooter, particularly one that’s exclusively team-oriented (there are, in fact, precisely zero free-for-all modes).  On a related note, Titanfall also bafflingly lacks the ability to vote on the next map when in matchmaking. And one other one: why too can’t we give personalized names to our custom pilot and titan loadouts? You eventually get five slots and, thanks to how the best loadouts vary wildly based on the map and mode you’re playing, you’ll need them all. I badly wanted to be able to rename my “Custom Pilot 3” to “Shotty Hardpoint,” as that slot’s combination of an upgraded EVA-8 shotgun with a perk that lets me briefly see through walls is perfect for camping the control points in Hardpoint Domination. Instead, I have to manually look at the loadout each time to make sure it’s what I want. Titanfall represents a potent fusion of established and modern design ideas, creating a tense and rewarding balance of power and moment-to-moment unpredictability. MOBA-like minions mix with traditional on-foot deathmatch, jetpack-powered locomotion, and giant-robot combat – each role playing its own part in the battle and coming with its own tactics and strategies – while the well-designed maps make the ideal weapons and loadout completely situational and dynamic. Though Titanfall is somewhat regrettably a barebones game in terms of modes and customization features available at launch, its intense action is almost as exciting to watch a friend play as it is to pick up the controller yourself. It’s surprisingly lacking many accoutrements we’ve come to expect in a multiplayer shooter, but it nevertheless unites its elements in a cohesive, approachable way. Titanfall earns a seat at the table with the genre’s entrenched powerhouses.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/25/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-review	 Plants vs. Zombies sets itself apart from other multiplayer third-person shooters. Firefights can still be fast and furious, with good shooting mechanics and class-based combat between 24 players, but thanks to its zany character classes and silly sound effects, it’s actually laugh-out-loud funny. It’s a good game that spits bright green peas in the face of today’s brown-and-grey shooters. Garden Warfare takes the popular characters from Plants vs. Zombies, renders them in surprisingly good-looking 3D, and then pits them against each other in light-hearted warfare. Remember the Cacti? They now run around sniping enemies from a distance with spines, and they can plant potato mines to cover their backs. The Chompers burrow underground and spit goo onto enemies to slow them and deactivate their abilities. While some classes will feel familiar to shooter fans (a sniper using mines is common, after all), it doesn’t feel like a Plants vs. Zombies skin was just slapped over a bland game. Garden Warfare respects the source material and uses it to inspire abilities that make sense and feel good to use.  Plants vs. Zombies’ fun humor also creeps its way into Garden Warfare. The overweight engineer zombie has loose pants, and his butt crack shows when he waddles around the map. The cactus makes hilarious noises, as if a kazoo is stuck in its throat. My favorite example is when the sunflower plants itself in the ground and blasts out a devastating death ray sunbeam, all while smiling with that gigantic, orange happy face. There’s no great writing or snappy one-liners, but it just radiates an enjoyable silliness. Garden Warfare has a relatively complex class system with all unique classes and abilities on each side. Despite the asymmetry, neither plants nor zombies feels advantaged in any of the three game modes, and it’s easy to jump into. Every class has only three abilities, and each is introduced with short and fun animated tutorial videos as they quickly unlock. So if you have a hunch that the pure-melee chomper class is for you, you only need to play a couple of matches to know for sure. Of the three modes available, two are pretty standard shooter fare. Team Vanquish is your standard 24-player deathmatch mode, where the first to 50 kills wins. Similar to the ticket system in the Battlefield games, reviving a downed teammate in Garden Warfare subtracts a point from the enemy’s score, which encourages teamwork. I was pleasantly surprised by the number of times I was brought back from the dead without even needing to ask. Gardens and Graveyards is an attack and defend mode with series of gardens that the zombies need to overtake before time runs out. It's fine, if a bit standard, but the best part is that the final round is always a unique activity like destroying the roots of a giant sunflower lighthouse or getting five zombies into a highly defensible mansion. It’s even more hectic and difficult than the previous stages, and it feels like a finale instead of just an ending. Driving home the last few shots on a final target just before dying is super satisfying.  A handful of maps are available in each mode, and they do a fine job of creating different scenarios within the same game mode. One level is packed with hills and tall buildings, which makes gaining the high ground advantageous. Others are more urban and condensed, making the melee and shotgun classes especially dangerous. Each map also looks distinct thanks to strong landmarks – like a pirate ship or a tree house – and varied art design. The last mode is more distinctive, and the closest thing to the original Plants vs Zombies tower defense gameplay. It’s a horde-like survival mode, which is you and up to three other friends against computer-controlled zombie enemies. It’s also the only mode you can play in split-screen. You must build and protect a garden from increasingly powerful waves of zombies. The garden can be planted in various places, which is great for replayability because it doesn’t feel like you’re always stuck in one area of a map. Flowerpots are littered around the map, and in them you can plant several kinds of plants. Certain combinations work better than others against a given zombie type, and it’s satisfying to figure out which flowers work best against which enemies. The tricky and fulfilling part is rearranging your defenses based on which type of wave you’re fighting. The engineer zombies can teleport right past your pots, so long-range attackers would be more useful, for example. For slower zombies, a fire and ice combination works wonders. It requires coordination of all players involved, and pairing abilities together pays off.  What’s interesting is that the potted plants you’re placing are finite. You start with a small inventory of common plants, and more are unlocked through booster packs that can be bought with in-game currency. So while opening a handful of packs might yield 20 common pea shooters, it’s possible you’ll only find two or three snapdragons. Once you use them, they’re gone until you open more packs. Their limited nature makes rounds more tense. Do you really want to use one of your rare plants now, or do you want to hold on to it? It’s good that playing for only a few hours can net enough money to unlock even the most expensive pack, which is guaranteed to include several rare items. Note that while there are no microtransactions in Garden Warfare right now, but EA says they’ll be added in the future. PopCap also plans to support the game with free bi-monthly DLC, including new maps, modes, and other cosmetic items and characters. Packs also contain accessories to customize your classes. It’s a simple addition, but it’s satisfying to unlock new glasses, mustaches, and other cosmetic bits to make your characters more personalized. Garden Warfare respects its roots by preserving its characters and their humor and skillfully adapting their charm to a third-person shooter. A few clever twists on the standard modes give the action some fresh personality, and the co-op survival mode is a fun homage to the original games. Plus the solid controls, fun modes, and varied map design make it a good shooter to boot.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	 Note: read the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 version of this review here. Every guard you come across in a stealth game is a sort of puzzle. How do I get past this guy without being spotted? Or do I put an arrow through his face? That’s the kind of thing Thief does well, using nice-looking shadows and scenarios with multiple paths to make us think before we steal. Everything else, from a clunky story and flat characters to a frustrating mess of a central map made me wish that this Thief reboot hadn’t bothered trying to connect those scenarios with fiction at all.  As his title would imply, main character Garrett steals pretty much anything that isn’t nailed down, including junk like forks, pens, cups - you name it. His indiscriminate kleptomania makes him seem more like a petty thief than a master, though. And he doesn’t have the charm, either in his flat voice acting or his lame, poorly lip-synced dialogue to make him a loveable Robin Hood rogue rather than some jerk who goes around swiping utensils off innocent people’s tables. He’s also wearing a corset for some reason. Going for a true stealth playthrough is a game of patience; waiting for the right moment to either slip through a hole in the guards’ patrol pattern undetected or take out targets one at a time. You can’t really simply overpower any enemies unlucky enough to catch a glimpse of you, because melee combat is a dumb and repetitive dance of dodging an enemy’s obvious incoming attack and countering. It’s easy against one enemy, but really tough against two or more, especially when there’s a guard with a crossbow involved. But that’s okay, because a good stealth game does everything it can to convince us to avoid direct confrontation. Stealth is where Thief works best. It’s tough but fair, and gives you breathing room to avoid detection when you keep to the shadows. The impressive lighting makes it almost believable that sometimes you can get close enough to a guard to steal the boogers from his nose undetected. Their AI isn’t fantastic and will occasionally get stuck on walls, but it’s good enough that guards will notice unconscious or dead bodies and open safes, and they react as I expected them to when lured around with Garrett’s selection of trick arrows. Most of those arrows, though, are extremely limited in where they can be used - particularly the fire, water, and rope arrows that only work on very specific objects like open-flame lights and leaking oil barrels. If the level design were more open more often, those limited uses would have many more possibilities, but with these often-tight corridors they’re one-trick ponies. Because you’re only allowed to use them in specific spots, I never felt clever for using them in a way the developers might not have foreseen.  The swoop ability, where you dash about 15 feet ahead almost invisibly, is what makes Garrett feel like a badass ninja, and one of the best things about Thief. It’s extremely handy for crossing gaps in the shadows where guards would spot you, and for quickly backpedaling out of danger when you round a corner and nearly bump into a guard. But most of his other movements feel clumsy, awkward, and inconsistent. For example, if the level designers didn’t specifically say “Yes, you can climb this,” then you can’t, even if it looks like you should be able to. Even jumping down off a ledge is a pain. Sometimes you can just walk off the edge, other times you have to push a button to drop, and others you can’t drop down at all. That’s part of what makes moving around the main hub map constantly frustrating. The City, as it’s simply known, is a maze-like jumble of dark, narrow streets and narrow passages over rooftops that mostly look alike. And I hate the way The City’s map is broken up with frequent loading screens, which can last upwards of 20 seconds on Xbox One and PlayStation 4. It makes Thief feel like an old game. Worse, it robs The City of a sense of continuity and makes it hard to get around. Even with the minimap, getting from point A to point B is a huge pain. Especially when the citizens get stuck in an annoying conversation loop.  Some of the campaign missions that follow the bland, supernatural-driven story take you to distinctive locations, like a colorful brothel and a genuinely creepy asylum. But too often the level design is claustrophobic and doesn’t leave much room to maneuver. They do have branching paths, and a handful of interesting puzzles, at least. In certain scenarios, mostly the side missions, things open up and give you room to decide how you want to get in and out of a building, with options to like going in through the vents, the basement, the roof, or just barging in the front door. You’re rated on each mission by what approach you took and how often you were spotted, so there’s lots of incentive to go back and try different approaches. It’s just a pity that developer Eidos Montreal didn’t realize that this is what Thief should be all of the time, not just intermittently.  Garrett’s Focus power is a bit of a crutch, but a much-appreciated one that cuts out frustrating searches for interactive items in a very dark game. You can buy Focus upgrades to make the already easy lockpick minigame easier, or give you hints about where treasure is stashed, but the only one that really changed the way I played in a negative way was the combat upgrades that let me quickly take down alerted guards. The ability to bash my way through enemies kind of defeats the purpose of a stealth game. Of course, a really good thing about Thief is that it can scale its difficulty however you want. I found the normal “Thief” difficulty setting to be tough enough for me, but pulling off a master-level heist with autosaves, Focus, and crosshairs disabled without being spotted is going to be worth some serious bragging rights. Because of that, Thief can take about as long as you want it to to complete. My time to beat the campaign and most side missions was about 15 hours, partially as a result of trying to get through the early missions completely undetected (and reloading if I was spotted) before giving up and dropping some bodies. It’d take much longer to stealth it all, and it’d be considerably quicker if you kill everything in your path.  That’s pretty much how you have to look at Thief: as a collection of challenging scenarios. Two of those scenarios can be accessed independently from the challenge menu with a selection of timed goals, complete with leaderboards. You’ll find one additional map is available as DLC. If you’re a stickler for frame rate, the PC version is the only place you can play Thief at 60 frames per second, as both the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions are limited to 30 and occasionally stutter below that - usually during cutscenes, oddly enough. (The Xbox One version is limited to 900p resolution). However, the mouse-and-keyboard inventory interface doesn’t work well - I couldn’t smoothly scroll through my items with the mouse wheel because some items, like the flash bomb, had to be de-equipped before I could switch. And, in addition to the annoying looping conversations, I kept running into an issue on the PC version in dialogue scenes and while peeking through keyholes that caused black bars to appear on either side of the screen and squish the image horizontally - usually it popped back after exiting that screen, but sometimes it would get stuck and I’d have to exit to the menu and reload my save. Thief has some strong stealth mechanics going for it, and getting away unseen with a big haul of loot can be an enormous challenge, but doesn’t always put that to good use. Between the hit-or-miss missions is an extremely annoying city hub map and a weak story full of bland characters, and Garrett himself isn’t as sure-footed as a master thief ought to be. Ignoring the story and cherrypicking the best side missions is the best way to approach it.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/18/strider-review	 Strider Hiryu has always seemed like the Boba Fett of the Capcom universe - iconic looks, massively popular with fans, yet has never really had a chance to fully deliver on his enormous potential. Double Helix’s 2014 reboot of the flashy platform series fleshes out the 1989 coin-op original and gives it a light Metroidvania-esque layer of exploration. While its slightly unbalanced design holds it back from being a genuine classic, it nonetheless does enough right to put a swagger back in Strider’s step for the first time in decades. From the moment you hang glide into Kazakh City, it’s clear that Double Helix has nailed Strider’s eye-searing sword slash, perpetual dash, and acrobatic panache. Strider simply feels wonderful to control - particularly in the smoothness of his signature slide and cartwheel moves, his silky manoeuvrability in scaling walls and ceilings, and the way he can slash his Cypher sword essentially as fast as you can enthusiastically pump the attack button. Tearing through enemy grunts and drones and leaving them to bleed sparks in the wake of Strider’s purposeful deathmarch never failed to satisfy over the six-hour duration of my playthrough.  Strider’s also got a slightly bigger bag of tricks this time around. The three ‘Option’ special abilities from the original game return - allowing you to unleash a cyber panther to attack ground-based enemies, a small droid to momentarily shield you and activate switches, or an eagle-shaped beam of energy to deliver a substantial blow, the latter of which is particularly useful for making dents in the health bars of most of the bosses. You can also unlock upgrades for Strider’s sword, such as the ability to baseball-bat back enemy projectiles or deliver incendiary damage with each slash. Switching up the blade types is crucial for overcoming different enemy types and opening colour-coded doors, but there are a few other useful applications, such as using the freeze blade to turn flying enemies into floating platforms to jump on. In a nice touch, the sword type you have selected is indicated by the changing colour of Strider’s scarf (well, scarf-like laser beam as it is now). So far so good, yet where Strider’s determined strut towards greatness stumbles slightly is with its inconsistent swings in difficulty from one boss fight to the next and the general rehashing of both enemy types and level-design elements. On its normal difficulty this Strider reboot just can’t quite find a balance - one moment you’re lazily button-mashing your way to an easy victory against one of Grandmaster Meio’s supposedly deadly assassins, the next you’re being knocked into the earth like a tent peg by the towering Mecha Pon gorilla-bot and having your health bar reduced to dust after a handful of hits. Part of the reason progression through Strider can at times sprint face-first into a screaming wall of frustration is due to the lack of a recharging health bar. This old-school design choice isn’t a problem for the most part, since each level has an overabundance of health packs and recharge stations to top you up with - you can essentially breeze your way from A to B slashing away without a second’s thought for self preservation. That is, until the door slams shut behind you in a boss arena, at which point health distribution becomes noticeably stingier, often depriving you of pickups entirely. This issue became particularly grating to me after the first time I was killed by the aforementioned Mecha Pon, since the checkpoint I was restarted at forced me to retrace my steps through a room of near-unavoidable laser beams and thus taking a substantial hit to my health bar before I’d even returned to face the boss again. What followed was a painful cycle of sudden deaths and swear words, and it certainly wasn’t the only time in Strider such an instance occurred. The juxtaposition of the relative ease of the main gameplay experience with the often brutally unforgiving boss fights can feel noticeably jarring at times.  Elsewhere, Double Helix has been guilty of copying and pasting entire chunks of levels in order to give the illusion of breadth to each environment, whilst completely ignoring the Siberian snow and Amazonian jungle areas from the original game in favour of setting almost all of Strider in the Neo-Soviet Kazakh City setting (a snowy Siberian-esque level was teased in very early screenshots for the game, but it's missing from the final release). The two absent locales would have added some much-needed variety to the environments, and as a result each area can feel a bit nondescript. This can make the Metroidvania-esque backtracking a touch confusing at times, and disappointing at others once you’ve realised you’ve zigzagged from one end of the map to the other just to unlock an underwhelming piece of concept art. Still, there are a number of sections that really shine, such as the zero-gravity areas in the research facility that flip the action on its head, the sky-high assault on the aerial battleship Balrog, and the series of warp gates that ping Strider around the city like a murderous pinball. Once I’d beaten the campaign and gone back for all the collectibles, I also enjoyed tackling the Beacon Run checkpoint races since, like I mentioned earlier, moving Strider at speed through each obstacle course is such a genuine pleasure - particularly after you've unlocked all the power-ups. This reimagining of the original Strider establishes developer Double Helix’s firm grasp on the essence of the joy of movement that makes Strider Hiryu such a great character. It lacks environmental variety and a sense of fairness when it comes to some of the boss battles, but it shows great potential for a revitalized series.
Andrew Hayward	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/12/the-lego-movie-videogame-review	 In the last nine years of LEGO games, we've come to associate the iconic plastic building bricks with not just creativity, but also silly, lighthearted humor. The LEGO Movie Videogame attempts to bring the wonderful film's consistently joyful and entertaining story and heroes into the same gaming format we’ve seen from developer TT Games’ series. But while it delivers some amusing scenarios across diverse terrain, the premise feels overextended.  Unlike many recent film-to-game adaptations that deviated from the source material to shake things up, The LEGO Movie Videogame unwisely decides to reenact the film's plot from start to finish. Essentially, it's one lengthy, interactive spoiler, so don't play it before seeing the movie. Main character Emmet's transformation from dopey, upbeat everyman to the fabled carrier of the Piece of Resistance seems like an ideal premise for a game campaign, what with its colorful and distinctive settings (like the adorable, neon-tinged Cloud Cuckoo Land), great cast (including Batman himself), and constant array of gags and jokes. However, it ends up showing that one of the strengths of other LEGO games is the charm that comes from recreating a non-LEGO scene in amusing ways. This one is just retreading the same material, and there’s not much of it to draw from. Where the strong recent LEGO Marvel and DC games had decades of comics and scads of heroes and villains to work with, The LEGO Movie Videogame has but a single movie script – albeit a pretty excellent one. While the game maintains a generally amusing tone and includes some enjoyable peaks – such as commanding Uni-Kitty's startling alternate form, or bashing through levels as a massive, Transformers-esque robot pirate – trying to turn a succinct, 90-minute film into a seven-hour game campaign means it inevitably drags in spots. Film clips interspersed between missions entertain, but a fair bit of the heart and humor from the film were left on the cutting room floor in editing, so it doesn't quite have the punch of the source material. And some levels are, frankly, boring. Like the construction site: sure, it follows the arc of the film, but that doesn't mean I need to spend 30 minutes performing virtual plastic manual labor simply to further the prescribed plot. Considering how the film rails against complacency, it's a bit ironic how content the game is to follow the same familiar instructions. TT Games' smash, bash, and solve LEGO game formula is very much intact in The LEGO Movie Videogame, though like all reliable game formats it’s no longer terribly fresh or exhilarating. Luckily, the stellar character roster casts a wide net, with the original characters from the movie flanked by exciting unlockable allies like Gandalf, Wonder Woman, and Superman. However, while it's more interesting to play as Batman or Green Lantern than a generic minifigure, the characters' abilities are most commonly used simply for clearing mundane chains of laborious roadblocks to forward progress. It's thankfully less repetitive with a local split-screen pal in tow (there's no online co-op here), but the action still devolves into drudgery too frequently. Solutions for opening up a new area of a level or taking down a certain enemy couldn't be more obvious – a cracked panel means Emmet's drill must be used, or a sparkly wall section inevitably leads Wyldstyle or another female character to climb it – and if the visual cue isn't obvious enough, you're often told exactly what to do. Good for kids, sure, but without a strong entertainment franchise to keep older players hooked, it doesn’t provide quite the same all-ages fun this series is known for. There's appeal in exploring the film's colorful locales and commanding such diverse heroes, but having to constantly swap between four or five different characters at a time to complete simple tasks becomes mind numbing quickly. That's not a new complaint for the series, but this game left me with little else to think about. Among the minor new aspects, Emmet's building sequences – in which you flick the analog stick to select the piece that's missing from the design – are a good addition that fit his role well, plus a nice nod to LEGO enthusiasts (the virtual bricks in these scenes look super-realistic, too). Conversely, Benny the Astronaut's hacking minigame joins the pantheon of dull hacking minigames, with this one taking the form of an undemanding riff on Pac-Man. Otherwise, The LEGO Movie Videogame holds no real surprises, either for fans of the film or the games. Across the PC, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Wii U, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3 versions, the only real differences are minor variations in visual quality. It obviously looks nicer on PCs and the new-generation systems, though it’s not dramatic. I noticed some odd texture flickering in the far-off distance on PlayStation 4, while the PlayStation 3 version has brief spurts of slowdown and occasional visual glitches, and the Xbox 360 release was the fuzziest-looking of the bunch. The presence of off-TV play on the Wii U version will certainly be a boon to anyone with children. (Note that the PlayStation Vita and Nintendo 3DS versions are a completely different game.) The LEGO Movie Videogame extends a concise and hilarious film into a much longer and less consistent interactive experience that sometimes dips into boring territory. Amusing scenarios and eye-catching environments are a plus, as is the wide unlockable hero roster, but most of the missions feel like an unimaginative retread of the same LEGO game formula. It's solidly enjoyable – but nowhere near awesome.
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	 At pretty much no point when I was playing Tomb Raider on Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 a year ago did I stop and say to myself, “man, I only wish this looked better.” Lara Croft’s excellent, cinematic reboot adventure doesn’t need extra special effects to make it worth playing. But nonetheless, playing through the Definitive Edition on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, which stacks up against the PC version’s high resolution and fancy hair effects, is excellent. The Xbox One can’t quite keep the frame rate up at 60fps, but I’ve been appreciating the difference. Tomb Raider is still one of the best of its genre, up there with the Uncharted series - but if you’re wondering whether this version is an improved experience beyond extra visual flair, the answer is: No, not enormously.  Realistic mud and sweat is not the next-gen revolution that gaming has been waiting for - but happily Tomb Raider doesn’t need extra special effects to make it worth playing. It’s still an excellent cinematic action game, up with Uncharted at the peak of the genre. The question for you, then, will be whether you fancy playing through it again and marvelling at a 1080p version of its stunning setting and resilient, likable heroine. (Assuming you haven’t already played on the great-looking PC version, that is.) The Definitive Edition comes with all the DLC - though this isn’t as significant and addition as you might hope. The only significant single-player DLC is a single extra secret tomb, those little self-contained tributes to Tomb Raider’s puzzle-driven heritage. The rest of it is either superfluous weapon attachments or multiplayer maps and items, and sadly the multiplayer hasn’t magically gotten better over the course of the past year. It still isn’t worth much of anyone’s time. More interestingly, the Definitive Edition employs voice and gesture control on Xbox One and PS4 (if you have the camera add-on). You can say “show map” to pinpoint your location or name a weapon to equip it. I did actually start using that last feature, until the Kinect interpreted the sound of my kittens having a playfight on the carpet as me saying “bow” in the middle of a shootout with three men with assault rifles. Enemies’ shouts also sometimes seemed to activate voice control, though I’m reluctant to blame Tomb Raider for that so much as Kinect itself. The last new addition is the ability to use Kinect to physically grab and rotate the artefacts that Lara finds, or lean left and right at cinematic moments to change the camera angle; I much prefer doing that with a control stick, considering it’s already in my hand.  These new control features and DLC don’t add anything to what was already a smooth, satisfying, genuinely thrilling action game, held together by an iconic, sympathetically written main character, fast-paced and varied combat, and some breathtaking action set-pieces. The linear story pulls you through at breakneck speed, taking Lara from frightened castaway to hardened survivor. The opening hours still feel self-indulgent, relying a little heavily on carefully planned cinematic moments, but it’s all for the sake of setting up Lara’s character. This is done so well that the forced linearity is easy to forgive. Tomb Raider reconnected me with Lara Croft, adding a new emotional dimension to one of gaming’s great heroines. It really is all about Lara - she’s vulnerable here, but never disempowered, and never less than totally capable in the face of extreme danger. We see flashes of her genuine nerdy passion for archaeology, too, as she marvels over artefacts and ancient structures. As much as I love Tomb Raider as an action game, I miss it as an explorative puzzler; there’s not much actual tomb-raiding in this origin story, but the secret tombs hidden around the island show that Crystal Dynamics still has great talent for environmental puzzles. I dearly hope we see more of this in a sequel.  The clever environment design distinguishes Tomb Raider from the linear action games whose set-pieces and tropes it borrows (see: the escape-from-a-burning-building sequence, sliding-down-a-slope-or-waterfall interludes). Each area of the island, from mountaintop village to forest to flotsam-littered beaches, is an adventure playground littered with hidden treasures, constructed for climbing and jumping and lateral thinking. The first time I played Tomb Raider, it was only when I went back to these areas without the story pushing me through them with a pistol in the small of my back that I appreciated how well designed they are. This time around I enjoyed it from the start, spending much more time exploring them for trinkets before moving on with the story’s agenda. It really is stunningly beautiful, too, and even more so now. The Enhanced Edition gives you plenty of opportunities to admire the island from cliffsides, misty mountain outlooks, and precarious climbing ropes, and it really makes me feel like an explorer when I crest a hill and look down on a complex nest of ancient buildings and forest paths, or when I’m climbing a mountain towards a far-off signal tower. The story, too, still has power the second time around, despite the weak supporting cast and not-entirely-welcome supernatural elements. Lara is strong enough to carry it.  Lara’s quick transformation into a hardened head-popping action heroine after her traumatic first kill still feels jarring, and marks the moment of Tomb Raider’s transition from survival game to all-out action. A few hours later, when you’re enjoying the full range of Lara’s weapons and combat techniques, it feels strange to remember that she goes through the first few hours of the game without a gun. But then, Tomb Raider is never afraid to change up the pace. You’re never in the same place doing the same thing twice, and that’s a large part of what makes it so memorable. The upstep in visual detail from the older console versions is a nice bonus, but Tomb Raider didn’t need massaging. It’s the same well-realised action reboot for Lara Croft that came as such a pleasant surprise last year. It’s still well-written, sympathetic, exciting, beautiful, and just incredibly well-made.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	 Without the Halo name and sound effects, Spartan Assault would be a colorful but otherwise barely remarkable twin-stick shooter. Aside from some annoying stability problems and dumb microtransactions, it’s competently made, but rarely memorable unless you’re playing the online-only co-op.  The top-down perspective turns the distinctive Halo arsenal into a bunch of pretty boring guns. Only the heat-seeking Needler has any real complexity to it beyond point and shoot, so most of them handle too similarly to make you play differently. Most of the variety comes from the armor abilities, like health regen. A few of the 30 single-player missions get ambitious, allowing you to drive a Scorpion tank or hijack a Covenant vehicle. It could’ve used more of that kind of freedom, because the typical search-and-destroy and timed holdouts against waves of enemies get old pretty quick. The Xbox One-exclusive two-player co-op is much better designed. Its five missions against The Flood are faster paced and have objectives that require teamwork, like lowering force fields to let the other guy through, and they’re quick to run through in just a few minutes. It’s the kind of thing that would’ve been great to play with a buddy on the couch, but Spartan Assault needs a second Xbox One to make it happen. The plot that ties it all together is flatly presented with a few animatic cutscenes and occasional voiceovers, but mostly it’s big blocks of text that precede each mission. It feels low budget, and leaning forward to read the tale of two Spartan soldiers defending an Earth colony between Halo 3 and Halo 4 didn’t hold my interest for long. Spartan Assault isn’t a difficult game, but the scoring element gives it some replay value beyond the five hours it took to beat. I like that earning a high score is about pacing yourself - you have to string together as many kills as possible within four seconds of each other to maximize it. Optional modifiers, like one that depletes your shield as you fire, and another that reduces the ammo of weapons picked up off the ground, do give you some more challenging ways to play. I was surprised at how often it crashed back to the Dashboard, though - three times in five hours. This isn’t a complex game! But the worst thing about Spartan Assault is its obnoxious microtransactions, which let you skip experience point grinding to change your weapon loadout at the start of a mission. Considering the only real point in using this gear is to bump up your score on the leaderboard, that’s pretty gross.  Halo: Spartan Assault is an uninspired top-down shooter that gets by mostly on the strength of its art and sound, all borrowed from previous games. It can be a challenge when cranked up with modifiers, and the co-op has a faster and more entertaining pace to it. But with all the crashing and lame microtransactions, it’s kind of ridiculous that this is the first Halo game to appear on Microsoft’s next-generation console.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/zumba-fitness-world-party-review	 Are you already a big Zumba Fitness person? Then you’re invited to Zumba Fitness: World Party. If not, you’re better off signing up for some classes first. World Party brings the dance-inspired workout into your living room by taking you around the virtual world to experience a large variety of rhythmic traditions. Dancing along with the on-screen instructor is fun, and it can get you sweating, but it’s not great at bringing uninitiated wallflowers into the party. As the name implies, World Party takes a global look at cardio dance styles. The main mode brings you to Los Angeles, Puerto Rico, India, and more. Each location features an impressive number of songs, with each collection lasting around 20 to 30 minutes, and the music and movements feel different by region. There’s a lot of variety present, and you can earn postcards and souvenirs for doing well. They’re just trophies for bragging rights, of course - your health improvement should be the biggest reason to continue.  The goal is to mimic the dancer and move in beat with the music. The Xbox One’s Kinect sensor (which displays its reading of you on the lower corner of the screen) always appeared to do a fine job of tracking my movements accurately. The thing is, it didn’t seem to care – it kept flashing words like “Hot!” and “Nice!” though neither adjective could be reasonably used to describe what I was doing. Even though I’m a Zumba novice, I was able to pass most songs and unlock new ones with little trouble. If you’re new to Zumba as a workout and want to learn more, World Party is a tad too forgiving to be a good instructor. That said, there is a training mode that allows you to isolate each dance move and practice it in normal or slow motion. It’s a nice extra mode that can help you nail the trickiest parts of a song, but it’s not as good at teaching you how to transition between the various moves. At least you can really isolate and master the booty pop. For workouts where you don’t have time for the world tour, there’s a quick-play mode available for picking single songs, as well as a mode that emulates a more traditional Zumba workout. A short, 20-minute workout features a handful of songs, and by the end your pulse will be elevated. This mode is convenient if you plan to use Zumba as a daily workout, as you don’t have to pick from individual songs, and it has dance variety built in. It pairs well with Zumba’s goal-setting feature, which lets you select the number of calories you want to burn, or the number of workouts you want to complete, and then assign yourself a deadline. It’s smart, because it grounds what you’re doing and sets up tangible fitness goals, which are essential motivators. Zumba Fitness: World Party won’t turn you into the next Fred Astaire, but those with an interest in dancing and some pre-existing talent will find plenty to enjoy in the various global dances. If, like me, you’re as footloose as a tree, stumbling through a Samba dance or two is still an enjoyable way to work out.
Leah B. Jackson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	 Using a giant marker to color your way through the puzzles of Max: The Curse of Brotherhood offers a great-looking and clever twist to the platforming genre. Well, it would if it weren’t so frustrating half the time. Once the novelty of drawing wears off, the curse we’re left with isn’t brotherhood, but awkward controls. I generally like the idea that I can make drawings to help solve platforming puzzles, even though it’s not as freeform as the concept implies. You get the marker early on, but before you do, climbing ladders and jumping over endless gaps as Max in the beautiful 2.5D environment gives you your first taste of the floaty controls. Cruelly, our little hero is a complete platforming pansy who can't even double-jump; one long-ish fall or hit from just about anything and he'll go down faster than that kid in Limbo. And he went down a lot. This game isn't as cuddly as it appears.  Once Max obtains the marker, don't expect to learn much more about the mustached freak who stole his kid brother or the mysterious land where you've both ended up for this seven-hour game. What seems like the start of a rich Disney-esque story about learning to love a bothersome sibling quickly fades away as though it was never there. At first the puzzles seem simple, since you can only use certain powers in specific ways, like raising an earth pillar to get up a cliff or making a vine to swing to a new platform. Even these early puzzles were a bit exhausting though, as my pillars weren’t always tall enough for shrimpy Max to reach the next area. But I couldn’t just extend a pillar – instead I’d have to destroy it and build an entirely new one, which was a bit cumbersome, especially in the heat of a chase.  New marker powers come at a nice pace though, and each one has its own vibrant chapter full of briefly interesting ways to use the mechanic. The water temple is dripping with clever puzzles that had me drawing spouts of water to create paths and making boats out of vines. The fire temple, on the other hand, is more of a thrilling race, where the marker helped me to quickly find an escape route from a fiery lava beast. Discovering new ways to utilize the power of the marker is entertaining, and each area offers some fun surprises.  Unfortunately, getting through the well-thought out puzzles in each section means dealing with the inaccuracies of the thumbstick-driven marker. (The fact that this is an Xbox One game that doesn’t even attempt to use the Kinect or Smartglass for a feature like this is extremely odd.) It’s not so much that their solutions are hard to figure out, but rather that I couldn’t draw where I wanted to and I could only use a small amount of ink. When I could draw, my vines, water spouts, or fireballs didn’t always show up as I intended. The marker feels as fat as it looks on screen. When I could get the marker working, successfully navigating Max through areas using vines, branches, and water spouts together to create a sort of mousetrap sequence was seriously satisfying. Some high-pressure levels towards the end where you’re outrunning lava are particularly epic as well.  Later on the challenge becomes more about figuring out which powers to use in what order, then drawing them perfectly in real-time, while running from something. If one piece of the puzzle doesn't fit quite right, you have to redo the whole thing. That quickly grows old. I assumed that having a stronger marker with extra powers would be more enjoyable as I went along, but it turned out that trying to string multiple imprecise powers together is much more annoying than challenging. Meanwhile, the collectable eyeballs stashed around the levels require a bit of extra puzzle-solving skill to find, but without any mention of what finding them all does, I wasn’t really motivated to track down the rest.  A bright platformer is just what we needed on Xbox One and Max: The Curse of Brotherhood’s vibrant setting and terrain-altering puzzles deliver. But the adventure doesn’t quite feel next-gen. With unintuitive controls, puzzle mechanics that’ve been done better elsewhere, and a story with the depth of a coloring book, it’s hard to stay invested in this short adventure.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	 Playing Peggle 2 just makes me happy. Whether I’ve just hit an unbelievably improbable shot or I’m watching a gratuitous display of abominable snowman twerking by new Peggle Master Berg after triggering a level-ending Extreme Fever, its ability to bring a smile to my face is uncanny. Way back in 2007, the original pachinko-meets-pinball Peggle was arguably the best puzzle game to come along since the legendary Tetris, and its sequel brushes off a few annoyances to become the first no-brainer, just-play-this-now game on the Xbox One.  Peggle 2 is similar to Rock Band 2 as follow-ups go. It takes an inherently compelling formula involving colored pegs, tweaks it ever so slightly, and adds a couple new twists. The ball -- still fired from a cannon at the top of the screen – feels both a tad smaller and a bit bouncier as well. Or perhaps the pegs you’re aiming to clear are themselves a bit larger. Regardless, it’s neither better nor worse than the enjoyably approachable physics of Peggle 1, it’s just different. You’ll have no adjustment period to worry about, though. Just fire away and enjoy. Sixty new boards and another 60 trials (aka challenge maps) give you plenty of bang for your 12 bucks, particularly when each of the 60 maps has three optional objectives, such as attaining Ace-level scores, racking up a certain number of points on a single shot, or pulling off specific trick shots. Armored pegs that require two hits to clear are also clever additions, and I particularly enjoyed the devilish reversal that some of the trials pull, in which you’re challenged to score under a certain amount of points when clearing the board. I do wish Peggle 2’s stages had more of the crazy gimmicks and wild themes found in Peggle 1, though.  Of course, Peggle 2’s most obvious new additions are its four fresh Peggle Masters, who join the returning derpy but lovable Bjorn the Unicorn and his Super Guide power. Though Jeffrey’s peg-crushing bowling boulder feels a bit similar to Lord Cinderbottom’s dragon fireball from the first game, his screen-clearing skills would’ve made him my favorite of the new foursome if not for Gnorman, whose lightning power zaps clusters of pegs all over the board as the ball bounces around. I love how the adorable heroes of Peggle 2 are given more screen real estate and extra personality this time around, so it only deepens the disappointment of learning that these five are it – meaning Peggle 2 has half as many Peggle Masters as its predecessor. If Popcap couldn’t manage an all-new cast as big as the original Peggle’s, it sure would’ve been nice if more old friends could’ve returned for the sequel. I sure miss Tula and her always-useful Flower Power ability. At least the new cast members each get his or her own Extreme Fever song; only Bjorn still busts out “Ode to Joy.”  If Peggle 2 is guilty of anything else, it’s being a little bit too excited about delivering fun times. It bizarrely suffers from overscan on every TV and monitor we threw it onto. It doesn’t cut off anything important, but it’s noticeable and annoying. Worse, it absolutely abuses the Xbox One’s GameDVR feature, automatically saving dozens of clips of your best shots. The problem is, it records shots that are no big deal, and I’ve had to go into Upload Studio and purge a slew of unwanted videos. The Peg Party multiplayer mode, meanwhile, is essentially identical to the same feature found in the Xbox 360 version of the first game, in which you try to outscore up to three other players battling on their own copy of the same board. With the ability to pick any map and tweak a number of win conditions, it’s good clean fun – a palate cleanser from Call of Duty or Battlefield – but it lacks local console play and the two-player Duel mode the original had too. I wonder if this will be addressed in the form of paid DLC – there’s an ominous shopping cart icon on the main menu that currently says “coming soon.” It’d be nice if the Leaderboards the 360 edition has were brought back too.   As expected, the PlayStation 4 version of Peggle 2 looks and plays identically to its Xbox One counterpart, with a few key improvements. First and foremost, both leaderboards and a local multiplayer option are here (fortunately, they've since been added to the Xbox One version too). Also, the Xbox One's overscan problem is absent on PS4, while the PS4 edition also doesn't aggressively auto-record gameplay clips because, of course, all video capturing on PS4 is handled manually. The most uniquely PS4 addition to Peggle 2, however, is the game's clever use of the DualShock 4's light bar. It lights up with the corresponding color of every peg you hit, meaning that when you play in a dark room you'll be treated to a subtle rainbow-colored light show on your controller. While it doesn't add anything tangible to the game, it's a fun idea that's very much in the spirit of Peggle's joyous attitude. I’ve already lost a lot of sleep to Peggle 2. Its Siren song of “just one more board” is difficult to ignore even late at night, and during the day anyone who walks by and sees it wants me to pass the controller to take a crack at besting my score. Peggle 2 is one-button joy. You think, you aim, you fire, and you sit back and watch as massive combos and bright popping colors take over. That it’s such a joyful sequel to an all-time classic stretches my grin from ear to ear, just like most of the rest of Peggle 2.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/fifa-14-review	 FIFA 14 on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One proudly boasts an entirely new engine, and though it may have been built from the ground up it’s still very much within touching distance of its current-gen sibling. The key differences are largely superficial, and while that sounds like criticism, it isn’t when the foundation is so good.That means it’s still a brilliant game, crammed with all the modes and features you’d expect from FIFA (that hasn’t always been the case with launch versions of FIFA). Occasionally some of the differences affect the way it plays, suggesting at where the series may go in the future, but for the most part they simply make FIFA 14 into a more polished and pleasurable version of the same experience.  Thankfully FIFA preserves the unparalleled variety of the current-gen iteration. This is not to be sniffed at, since this hasn’t always been the case – the Wii U launch version of FIFA 13 was a severely gutted version. But this is FIFA, as you know it – from one-off fixtures to ongoing seasons, online friendlies, a selection of that week’s matches, a career mode, and skill games. And of course the revamped Ultimate Team, one of FIFA’s most popular modes. It’s all present and correct. And if you’ve already started the season on current-gen, progress in modes like Ultimate Team is transferable. For a sports title, FIFA still can’t be beaten for its sheer variety. The most notable difference is perhaps unsurprisingly the way it looks. Graphically it’s much sharper, smoother, and more detailed, with everything from player likenesses to the texture of the pitch benefitting. Up close, players still look a little dead behind the eyes and move awkwardly when shaking hands or getting substituted. But there are still loads of little details that impress, like the way fabric ripples as a player moves or two balls being on the pitch at once thanks to an over-eager ball-boy trying to restart the match. Taken individually they’re minor improvements, but have a really great cumulative effect.  The best aspect of next-gen FIFA 14 is undoubtedly the extended range and depth of player animation. Current versions of FIFA use a limited stock of core animations to represent a wide range of different actions. There was no unique through-ball animation, for instance, with the game using the animation for a more generic pass. But next-gen FIFA 14 makes no such compromise. There’s so much variety, and though it doesn’t directly impact how you play, it makes what you do look so much more realistic and visually appealing. Now when you  hit a cross-field pass, the player will open up their body and really dig under the ball. It feels like you're making that type of pass. And this extends to most actions on the pitch, whether that's playing a cheeky through-ball with the outside of the boot or dinking a low pass out wide. While watching back a goal I scored in slow motion, I spotted the player gently rolling his foot over the ball, taking it away from the defender. This wasn't down to anything I did – it's all automated, a product of context – but it made the match feel much less mechanical and more attractive to play and watch. Changes to gameplay aren’t as extensive as I was anticipating, though there are a couple of areas in which this version does feel slightly different. When defending on the 360 and PS3, I normally apply lots of pressure onto the opposing team and use the slide tackle to win back the ball. It's crude and heavy-handed, but it works a lot of the time. In the Xbox One and PS4 version this is a much less viable tactic, since players have more self-awareness. So when you go in for a sliding challenge, it's highly likely the player in possession will hurdle the incoming tackle. It’s far more authentic, and makes defending much more about maintaining your shape, closing down play, and tracking runs – all of which is aided greatly by the players’ improved positional awareness and decision making. It does a better job of approximating the real-life sport, yet importantly doesn’t make it any less fun. Those heightened player reactions again also enhance the look of matches in other ways; for instance, sometimes when I shot on goal, if there was a player in the way, they’d do their best to duck out of the way of the incoming strike. Again, it subtly but potently adds to the realism.  Another noteworthy change is the ball feels much more like an independent entity than ever before. During matches there are now instances in which the ball breaks free – after a rebound or misplaced pass – and both teams have to chase it down, rather than possession simply alternating between the two. It’s not revolutionary but I definitely haven’t encountered that openness in FIFA before. It creates a much more lively, physical experience, with more tussling and physical matchups. It produces a more realistic representation of the sport, and I found it a more enjoyable, unpredictable, and a slightly more competitive experience. That sense of life is strengthened by the improved stadiums and crowds. Spectators are now a fully three-dimensional, reactive presence – the home and away fans respond differently depending on the ebb and flow of the game. It’s not incredibly varied – you can still spot the same faces and shirts – but it’s a massive, long-awaited improvement. Stadiums are touch more detailed, too, with some well-known grounds even having exteriors, but this is mostly limited to the pre-match credits. It’s a really nice presentational flourish, though doesn't dramatically improve the experience. FIFA 14 isn’t a leap into the future of the series; it has a lot in common with the version of FIFA 14 that's already out. There are real flashes of potential, though, and hints at where it may go in the future – the sheer variety of animation, cognisant players, more palpable atmosphere – but what FIFA 14 on next-gen consoles does right now is add an impressive visual layer to an already brilliant sports game.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/26/battlefield-4-xbox-one-review	 Battlefield 4 is a greatest hits album of DICE’s multiplayer first-person shooter legacy. It retains the defining DNA of Battlefield 1942, re-adopts Battlefield 2’s brilliant Commander mode, and exaggerates the destruction of Battlefield: Bad Company 2, all while embracing the realism, class reorganization, and gorgeous graphics of Battlefield 3. Most of the time, Battlefield’s unpredictable, vehicular-based competitive combat is predictably excellent. What I didn’t anticipate was DICE getting in its own way. What we've never seen before in a Battlefield game is the drastic, and often inconsistent way Battlefield 4 forces its two massive 32-player teams to adjust to evolving environmental conditions. A dam bursts, crushing everything below with metric tonnes of rubble and floods. Half a hotel disintegrates, exposing a control point and depriving snipers of a valuable perch. Large-scale destruction like this changes the fundamental layout of an area, forcing combatants to react intelligently and change their strategies and loadouts on the fly. Even after the magic and surprise is gone, teams always need to be prepared for how they’ll react when a crumbled tower keeps their tanks out of enemy territory. Coming out on top because your new strategy adapts to and harnesses the new level design is even more satisfying than the XP and armory unlocks you earn along the way. That said, not every instance of awe-inspiring devastation is as excellent as these. Often, triggering the event takes minutes of work, and the result is sometimes superfluous, feeling more like DICE’s obligation to include it in every map rather than something that achieves anything of value. A smashed satellite at the center of a map becomes a minor inconvenience for vehicles, for example. A toppled tower actually makes it irritating to navigate an underground area, and manually detonating underground explosives from a terminal takes you away from the action in one of the biggest maps. Most offensive of all, a flooding town’s rising water levels significantly inhibits mobility – and is especially frustrating if you’re in a fierce tug-of-war for a base-busting bomb in the terrific new Obliteration mode.  If you're smart about it, you can take advantage of most maps’ effects, though – including some of the less magnificent, more subtle things. Diminished visibility as a typhoon assaults an island might mean changing your favorite red-dot sight for something that sees in the dark. Hunting bomb carriers as the sun rises means they’re increasingly vulnerable as the match goes on – the faster they arm control points early on, the easier their lives will be later. In addition to those major destruction events, DICE has rediscovered a major factor that defines Battlefield’s greatness among other modern military shooters: finally, for the first time since Bad Company 2, teams can tear down most simple structures. Knocking out supports to topple houses and collapse roads isn’t quite as exciting as a skyscraper sinking into a bay, but it’s great for keeping enemies out of troublesome spots or creating a crawl space to hide in. One of my favorite maps – Golmud Railway, where DICE’s designers take expert advantage of its enormous scale, several scattered control points, and aerial warfare – has a mobile control point in the form of a train. Fighting for control is an entertaining, mobile struggle. More than anything, and despite its new features, Battlefield 4 most closely resembles Battlefield 3, if only for the similar feel of its physical, scary weapons. Accounting for bullet drop as a sniper – which involves more mental math now thanks to adjustable zero-targeting ranges – remains one of the most fulfilling things about Battlefield’s skill-based gunplay. Elsewhere, one of the smallest departures is the most significant, at least for knife-fighters. Stealth attacks from behind, as usual, guarantee a new set of dog tags for your knife-kill collection. Stabbing at someone from the front, however, gives them a brief opportunity to reverse the attack. Counter-kills are an incredibly satisfying way to put down someone who wasn’t careful enough to wait for you to turn your back, and an interesting new tactical layer to what used to be a panic button. Where Battlefield 4 most brilliantly distances Battlefield 3 is in its map design. The best Battlefield maps are challenging and satisfying, demanding you take advantage of everything at your disposal, and Battlefield 4 does this extremely well. Screaming across the terrain in the bouncy new off-road buggy is a blast, but its vulnerability may lead you to choose a tank instead. But even its rear is vulnerable to infantry rockets. Battlefield’s interesting relationship between infantry and vehicles goes deeper here, with additional means to take down enemies, whether you’re immobilizing vehicles or filling them with a team to attack in force. The soldiers in that ride will likely have a more varied array of gear than ever, too, because character classes and vehicles have more extensive customization options in Battlefield 4. Recon is no longer limited to the sniper/shotgunner role, allowing him to equip a mid-range DMR to do some actual recon. Classes are defined by gadgets rather than guns, and it permits a more aggressive play style for unit types previously restricted by their loadout options. Much like Battlefield 4’s gameplay, its customization is more liberated than ever.  Terrific level design is responsible for a lot of what makes this work well, and I’d wager that a good chunk of Battlefield 4’s maps will live as classics. Everything is, as always, engineered around Battlefield’s territory-control Conquest mode. Hainan Resort, with its destructible hotel centerpiece and terrific mix of air/ground/sea combat options, is Wake Island-levels of outstanding. Awesome opportunities exist for every class, every pilot, every aggressive paratrooper to pull off an unbelievable kill or anxiety-inducing control point capture. It's not the only excellent one. The Rogue Transmission map gives planes plenty of breathing room, and ATVs can avoid aerial vehicles using underground passageways. It’s a map that demands a sense of spatial awareness and having a reliable, coordinated squad. It’s also one of Battlefield’s best-in-class vehicular balancing acts – vulnerable four-wheelers can still escape tanks, which in turn have a great, unobstructed view for clearing the air of choppers and jets. Not every map works great with every mode, though. The thrill of punching through enemy lines, destroying control points, and proceeding to the next seems less strategic than ever in some Rush maps. Paracel Storm, for example, funnels attackers into punishing bottlenecks dominated by defenders. In others, predatory offense can feel like desperate brute force, particularly in matches with lots of players. Obliteration maps with water are the most troublesome – the mode’s bomb resets if it ends up in the drink, leading to chaotic confusion and frustrating losses.  Domination is a fast and focused Conquest variant with scaled-down maps and infantry-only fighting, which is a nice change of pace from the contemplative exploration of the open-ended Battlefield maps. In that sense, it’s closer to Call of Duty than Battlefield, for better or worse. Likewise, Defuse mode is a shameless Counter-Strike clone with a Battlefield twist. Planting a bomb behind enemy lines without respawning is even scarier when someone punches a hole through a wall with a rocket. Explosives and exposure don’t break it, mercifully, since the complex maps have so many routes to escape or flank foes. Operation Locker, a tight-quarters prison with winding hallways and plenty of places to flank enemies, always has me looking over my shoulder, and will find a dedicated Domination/Defuse audience, no doubt. Commander Mode brings out the best in Battlefield 4. When one player on each team steps away from their guns to issue orders from a top-down tactical screen to 31 teammates, amazing things can happen. It's hard to believe that participating war in a hands-off capacity can be this satisfying! Coordinated Commanders who work well with their squads will find themselves steamrolling enemies who can’t. The symbiotic relationship between soldier and Commander creates cyclical reward that enables new strategies in Conquest, Rush, and Obliteration, if you choose to use it. Commanders who send reinforcements to a suppressed squad, or send enemy-spotting UAVs overhead of hotspots, will earn the trust of a team. Squads who capture specialized control points earn additional attack options for their leader to deploy, such as a missile strike. Like in Battlefield 2, Commander Mode will change the way serious players play a Battlefield game. It is, more so than the sometimes-awesome evolution of landscapes, a reliably interesting feature that DICE should never let go of again.  Also difficult to fathom is how Battlefield 4’s campaign uses so much to accomplish so little. You might've seen the first 17-minute video that DICE released of Battlefield 4 gameplay, featuring a run through the first story mission: a frantic escape sequence in Azerbaijan. It’s a spectacular showcase of Frostbite 3 engine’s incredible technical capabilities, DICE’s skillful ability to build tension, and Battlefield’s prowess as a flexible sandbox shooter. It is also emblematic of Battlefield 4’s complete inability to restrain itself. Its campaign is an obnoxious assault of explosions, blood, profanity, and anger wrapped in an apparent parody of a first-person shooter. In five hours, Battlefield 4 hits on almost every predictable cliché expected: Tank mission, boat mission, stealth mission, jailbreak, sewers, sudden but inevitable betrayal, dastardly Russians, defying orders, and, of course, a torture sequence. Retreading thoroughly charted territory isn’t exciting here, and Battlefield 4 regularly squanders or underutilizes its fragmented strengths in designing those levels.  It introduces squad commands, allowing you to order teammates to attack, but it’s just that simple. Point, allies attack, and then you move on. Why aren’t they shooting at enemies like this in the first place? Level design is increasingly constrained as the campaign proceeds, and corridors and other tight spaces leave little room for options, team play, and the flexibility that we see flaunted in earlier, larger encounters. Spaces seem to shrink over time, and verticality is tossed aside in favor of forward-facing firefights. I’ll give it this: Battlefield 4’s single-player never quite sinks to the same level as Battlefield 3’s oppressive linearity, follow-the-leader structure, and borderline absence of interaction. It's also very pretty, and the stellar lighting, particle, physical, and environmental effects are impressive across the vibrant, visually diverse settings. But it’s a surface-level success where there isn’t much depth. Leveraging that realism, Battlefield 4 aims for an evocative, emotional experience, and utterly fails. I count its disjointed story among the least emotionally affecting experiences I’ve had with a game (that actually tried for one). Any plea for plausibility or depth dies when a bodycount milestone earns you a headshot bonus, weapon unlock, or gold medal pop-up. Between its unwillingness to put primary characters at serious risk and a meaningless moral-choice finale, Battlefield 4 pulls almost every emotional punch.  Meanwhile, the plot has too many moving parts and not enough time to give them each due credit. It’s unsure whether to focus on the suffering of your squad or the geopolitical gibberish. Writing is not Battlefield 4’s strong suit. Sometimes it fails to explain narrative progression clearly. Other times it’s awkward, out of place, and embarrassing. One of its most confusing story surprises is addressed with nonsensical blasé: “Things were f***ed. Then they were unf***ed.” When a secondary character doesn’t make it to the next scene, a squadmate pointlessly notes that the “dude is dead.” My personal favorite: “If you’ve survived a nuclear explosion like I have” is the actual start to a sentence someone says. Honestly, it feels like something is missing here. A gaping “Two Days Later” hole introduces sudden changes in character behavior and an out-of-nowhere new setting and to-do list. It’s as if half a campaign and the whole of its humanity got lost along the way. Battlefield 4 is an excellent multiplayer game that makes the most of its ambitions, proving once again that destruction is a valuable strategic addition to competitive combat, which reaches its full potential with two killer Commanders are bringing out the best in their squads. On the other hand, its single-player campaign is a disappointing, but a functioning and familiar game with overwhelming action and remarkable spectacle. Xbox One's launch issues aren't significant enough to destroy the enjoyment, but it's bothersome in rare cases when connecting to friends fails or matches crash.
Leah B. Jackson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/zoo-tycoon-review	 In Zoo Tycoon, nothing is more important than your animals. Whether you're simply watching an elegant giraffe leaning over a pool to drink water or marveling at the adorable baby elephants romping around, every species in this menagerie is delightful. But unlike the original Zoo Tycoon games for PC, the Xbox One version’s poorly laid out menus and worse Kinect functionality make them hard to enjoy.  You learn how to become a zookeeper through 10 in-depth training missions that clearly explain the most important aspects of the job – building exhibits and managing the layout – while not overwhelming you with details. This is where you learn to swap between the neat third-person exploration mode and the top-down Tycoon mode. It’s also the first time you get a taste of the inefficient menus you must consistently flip through to conduct zoo business, no matter which of the three modes you’re playing. While menus are a consistent and important part of every sim, especially the older Zoo Tycoon games on PC, they’re poorly designed for the Xbox One. There are nice page-turning sound effects and some extra educational information, but that's where the praise ends. For example, to keep your animals happy you’re required to place animal-care options like a feeder and bathing station in every exhibit, along with some enrichment options for them to play with. That nostalgic process is made harder than it needs to be by the cumbersome menu design, which makes it aggravating to move from one build option to another. There’s no option to build multiple instances of the same item either, so if you place one tree (or anything) and want to place a second, you’re forced to go back through the menus every time.  Building new locations automatically adds the most accessible paths for your guests to get there, which, while convenient, takes away some creative freedom. Considering I'm supposed to be making the zoo of my dreams, it's annoying that I’m unable to decorate how I please. Making sure all of your cute animals are happy is a perpetual priority, as is raising your zoo’s fame. Timed scenarios only give you 15 to 45 minutes to complete everything on a checklist, sometimes leaving little time to sit back and enjoy the exhibits you’ve built. Stopping to smell the roses once in a while might’ve made always having the same few objectives tacked on to otherwise-unique missions get repetitive a little less rapidly.  Yet it's research, which is undoubtedly important for real-life animal conservation efforts, that's the worst part of Zoo Tycoon. In Campaign and Challenge, you have to research just about everything, including animals, concessions, facilities, decorations, scenery, exhibits, all the way down to how you advertise your Zoo, before you can build or do it. Researching can take anywhere from five seconds to two minutes, but you never know how long until after you select it, and you can only ever research one thing at a time. Having to sit there and wait for a lion exhibit I want to finish researching so that I can research the lion, as well as all of the individual enrichments, one at a time, is a major frustration. I expected Campaign Mode to roar louder than the other two, but its 20 levels all feel too similar to one another – and to the tutorial – and boredom sets in quickly. Their rewards are just as thin, with only a couple of decorations and a location to unlock for use in the other two modes. Challenge Mode tests your ability to make the most of your resources by plopping you in a location with a set budget, along with periodic objectives. But if you’ve ever balanced a checkbook, the difficulty here doesn’t live up to the mode’s name. Freeform Mode is the only place where Zoo Tycoon spreads its wings and refreshingly lets go of the confines of money and research. The only goals are to enjoy yourself, the animals, and build whatever you want at your own pace and progression comes at a rewarding pace.  Multiplayer allows you and up to three friends to work together in any of the three modes, but unless you’re using headsets it can be hard to coordinate. Everyone can contribute to tasks for completion, so getting objectives done is easier than ever. It’s also fun to ride around with friends in buggies in third-person view. But you can still only research one thing at a time which seems limiting when you have extra people waiting around for certain things to finish researching. Again, though, it all comes back to the animals, and in theory, Kinect offers a whole new way to interact with them. They’re a disappointment. You can build three Kinect-capable interactions in your zoo, but they only work for specific animals. Feeding and washing animals with Kinect can be frustrating because the camera didn’t always pick up my movements, but the facial recognition is incredible when it works. While it can only be used with chimps and big cats, they can distinguish when you’re blinking or opening your mouth and mirror your actions. I loved playing with my baby chimps… but it’s always faster and easier to use the controller to manipulate the animals than Kinect.  Zoo Tycoon aims to be educational and entertaining for kids of all ages, and in some instances it succeeds. While the animals are gorgeously detailed in their own right, learning about them and creating an enriching environment for the cuddly critters isn’t always presented in an enjoyable way. Additionally, the never-ending menus are extremely cumbersome, and young players may get lost while trying to navigate through them for every single thing. Its charming and adorable animals can melt hearts, but most of your time will be spent navigating through bad menus.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	 Take a moment to conjure up in your head all the things you dislike most about gaming with Kinect, and there's a great chance that The Fighter Within does all of them. Practically non-functioning menus? Check. Paper-thin gameplay mechanics? Check. Half-baked gesture controls that make simple, straightforward concepts feel vague and ungainly? Big check! The terribly written gobbledygook of a story merely adds insult to injury for a game that, top to bottom, feels like a flailing first attempt at using a new piece of hardware.    In theory, The Fighter Within is about going toe-to-toe with martial artists from a rival dojo. But your first, and most formidable opponent will be the Kinect-driven menus, which make even the basic act of scrolling through and selecting things an exercise in frustration. Confirming your choices requires that you hold a floaty, twitchy cursor over what you want, push in towards the screen, and then pull back, all without accidentally leaving the boundaries of what you're trying to press, because if you do, that resets the whole process. It's a borderline-broken system that left me with little choice but to keep a controller nearby at all times. When you're finally ready to switch from fighting the interface to fighting other characters, things improve somewhat, if only briefly. The fundamentals of Fighter Within's system are sound enough, owing mostly to how well Kinect tracks basic movements like punches and kicks. Landing or blocking enough consecutive hooks and straights triggers a powerful combo or counter attack, complete with some snazzy animations and close ups. But unfortunately, they play out as in-engine cutscenes AFTER you've thrown your blows. This separation of action and payoff means that when the best stuff is happening on screen, you're nothing but a spectator. And that's when Fighter Within is working properly. The second it tries to do anything more elaborate, like throws or finishing moves, it trips over its own shoelaces and falls flat on its face. The gestures are simply too abstracted to feel anything like the moves they trigger, and worse yet, some are so similar to each other that you'll never be sure what's going to come out. I quickly lost count of how many times a throw attempt came out as a hook, or a straight kick got mixed up with a power attack. The result is a haphazard mess that both looks and feels disjointed. At one point, I lost 20 minutes of my life trying to perform the gesture to pick up a stick. Never again Kinect. Never again.    If its borked controls weren't enough, Fighter Within plops a laughably bad story down on top of them. Meet Matt, a snot-nosed martial artist who wants to join a local dojo because...reasons. He and the rest of the cast generally take themselves very seriously, which means when you hear cheesy nonsense like this (play swag clip) you're more likely to laugh at them than with them. Some characters allude to personal motivations, and a lot of hot air gets blown around, but ultimately, it's nothing but a flimsy excuse to have you fight a long stream of AI opponents who look just as dumb as they fight. And every time things threaten to get even a little fun or spirited, someone starts moaning about mommy issues, or giving exposition about Genghis Khan. Not even making this stuff up, folks. Aside from the very basics of punching and kicking, nothing in The Fighter Within works well, and very little works at all. It's gesture recognition is abysmal, its fighting is shallow, and it wastes too much time trying to clumsily tell a silly, unnecessary story. In short, it's everything Microsoft promised Kinect 2.0 wouldn't be.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	 Ryse: Son of Rome is about going to beautiful places and repeatedly stabbing everyone you meet there. Developer Crytek’s Roman tale looks magnificent, and its typical revenge story setup is handled with great care, but the combat doesn’t always keep up with the high bar Ryse sets for itself in all other departments. Ryse’s story is delivered out of chronological order. Rome is crumbling under a barbarian assault, and Marius, a proud and decorated Centurion, is escorting Emperor Nero through his palace. One moment later, Marius is a fresh-faced greenhorn of the Roman army. As I progressed, I enjoyed learning more about how the circumstances became so dire. And despite the abnormal structure, the story was never difficult to follow even when it took a few unanticipated turns.   If you want to show off the capabilities of your shiny new Xbox One to your friends, Ryse is more than capable of lending a hand. Environments don’t just look terrific technically; they have great variety. There’s plenty of Roman architecture, but Ryse also takes you to beaches dotted with shipwrecks, trap-filled swamps, and Crytek’s signature lush forests. Characters’ animations look fluid and natural, even during hectic fights with dozens of fighters going at it. It sounds great as well, with special mention going to the excellent voice acting. Strangely enough, Emperor Nero’s sons sound a lot like Bane and the Joker from Nolan’s Batman films. If it’s supposed to be an homage, those voice actors nailed their roles.   Ryse’s biggest issue is that not even halfway through its modest six-hour campaign, you’ll have seen and experienced a vast majority of your offensive options. Combat consists of basic hits, bashes, blocks, and heavy attacks. In most battles, you can chain these actions together in nearly any order and still be successful, which remains fun until the flashy animations start to lose their luster. There is a system in place to land perfect attacks, but those too are easy to execute once you understand them.   What’s there isn’t at all bad, it just feels like a foundation for something far greater and more nuanced that never comes. Enemy variety does a bit of work to liven things up. Some foes are unblockable, some charge you, and some assault you with a flurry of dual-sword attacks. Dealing with them requires you to care about your blocks, attacks, and movements, which is fun until you figure out their repetitive patterns.   Many games of this style rely on upgrades in the form of unlockable combos and items to add mechanical depth. But most of Ryse’s are boring passive bonuses that don’t change the way you fight. Your health bar can be extended, as can your slow motion power-up. Executions, which are gory displays of dismemberment that Ryse revels in, are the other thing you’ll spend experience points on, but they’re focused more on the showy outcome than the work it took to make them happen.   When an enemy is weakened, you can initiate a brutal execution with one button tap. From there, you simply match your button presses to they color the enemy glows – either blue or yellow. You’re given ample time to hit the buttons, and even if you miss the execution still goes through. Hitting the prompt in time just earns you a higher rating for the kill and rewards you with more health, experience, or whatever else you have selected as an execution reward. Upgraded executions give you larger bonuses for completing them, but the input hardly changes. So what’s the point? This one mechanical decision managed to extract most of the danger from a game about burly, cruel men who savagely kill each other. The standard hack-and-slash combat is occasionally broken up by special gameplay sections that, at the very least, give you a break from the norm. Sometimes it’s as simple as manning a crossbow turret with unlimited ammo and mowing down barbarians. Other times you arrange your warriors into a phalanx and march them forward into fortified territory, blocking arrows and chucking spears. Like your normal actions, none of the activities ask much of you. They’re about the spectacle, which, to be fair, is pretty impressive.   Boss battles aren’t common, but when they do rear their heads, they can be frustrating. On one hand, bosses often attack faster or have heavy attacks that can’t be blocked, which is a nice change from the rhythm of combat you’ll have grown accustomed to by then. On the other, Ryse likes to lean on the old regenerating-boss-health trick to extend the fights, but doesn’t bother to change up their behavior when their bar refills. You don’t fight the same boss in a markedly different way now that he’s really mad – you just fight him again.   The co-op multiplayer modes let you dismember enemies with one friend in the famed Roman Colosseum. Before each fight, you pick a god to serve, each with different bonuses. One player might allow both to recover health with executions, while the other might allow both to earn focus. Having to defend another guy, and thus preserve your own bonuses, is an extra layer of strategy that isn’t present in the single-player mode, and it’s badly needed. However, aside from ensuring the right player lands an execution at the proper time, the combat remains held back by the same passiveness of the campaign. The environment does shift constantly, with new blades, towers, and pits springing up every few minutes as the objectives change. It’s a cool way to keep the combat dynamic within one round.   PC Version -- October 9, 2014 Ryse: Son of Rome for PC makes this already great-looking game look even better, with support for high-resolution monitors and settings for shadows, shaders, and even the quality of animations. Our GeForce GTX 780-equipped PC ran Ryse without a hiccup, but mid-tier GPUs might have to settle for medium settings - which still look excellent. The visual spectacle is the best thing about Ryse, which means the PC is the best place to play it. But as you’d expect for a port, this new version does nothing to correct any of the issues I had with Ryse’s repetitive combat when I played it on Xbox One. In fact, its new multiplayer mode, Survival, actually amplifies them a bit. The premise is that you’re bleeding out, and you must constantly kill to keep refilling your health bar. (Because you’re a vampire, I guess?) I’d hoped for exciting pacing, but in practice you’re forced to do the repetitive tasks of combat over and over again even more quickly than normal. At least the multiplayer DLC maps are included in the PC package, which gives it some improved variety in scenery. More Must-See Xbox One Launch Content: Ryse has an entertaining story and sky-high production values. The gameplay that’s there isn’t bad – it just stops in its tracks before it gets anywhere near close to demanding. The multiplayer mode has some neat ideas, like a deadly, shifting Colosseum, but it’s hamstrung by the same combat issues that affect the main campaign. But if spectacle is what you want, Ryse: Son of Rome will keep you entertained.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/20/need-for-speed-rivals-review	 When fleeing from a pack of cops at 150mph through a forest after midnight, I found it difficult not to be excited by Need for Speed: Rivals – and then a helicopter’s searchlight pours in through the trees for an additional adrenaline kick. Those initial potent highs aren’t sustainable, though, and after a while I was left wishing for just a bit more variety and depth to keep the thrills coming beyond simply doing the same thing online. That said, I still found it an exciting, highly polished experience, which appealed to both to the racer and more casual thrill-seeker in me.   Developed by Ghost Games, Rivals feels like the natural successor to the work of previous NFS developer Criterion. (Unsurprising really consider the majority of the staff went over to the new studio.) It combines Hot Pursuit’s cops-versus-racer dynamic with the freeform gameplay of Most Wanted’s open world. In many ways it’s the best of both, although if you’ve played either of those a great deal, as I have, you may get a feeling of déja vu from Rivals. Rivals takes place in the fictional Redview County, which has probably the most diverse geography imaginable. Within the confines of its map you can take in parched deserts and lush vineyards, upmarket seaside promenades and snowy mountain passes. It provides a welcome change of pace after the urban sprawl of Most Wanted, though I came to really miss those concrete labyrinths when I was outrunning the cops. But it’s ultimately a tradeoff, with Redview’s long, winding roads setting the stage for some truly operatic chases that go on for miles. They’re better suited for drifting and pushing fast cars to their limits, like Hot Pursuit, instead of outfoxing the cops and hiding like in Most Wanted. It’s all about the ballet of the chase. It’s a shame there wasn’t room in this world for both play styles, as it would’ve given us more variety to play with. And very occasionally, I did find myself being spotted by the cops even though I’d seemingly given them the slip, which was slightly frustrating. Each stretch of road is crammed with various challenges, including standard races and time trials, new cars to shut down, and records to smash. But for all of its gorgeous scenery, I found Redview a slightly less fun and secret-filled place to explore. There are no billboards bearing your friends’ faces to crash through, no super cars squirrelled away, and fewer jumps than previous games. And while there are a few hidden pathways to be found and the possibility of going off-road occasionally, I also found myself more frequently attempting to head off the beaten path only to be put back into place by an officious barrier. Most Wanted encouraged you to explore its train tunnels and jump off rooftops, but Rivals keeps you firmly on track.  Rivals is fantastically pretty, making great use of your next-gen console or PC. Cars look brilliant, near photorealistic. But Need for Speed has always had a slightly heightened approach to its presentation, and that’s still the case. Its cars are noisy creatures, always ready to race – look closely and you’ll see beads of moisture dripping down the bodywork, as if the car’s physically exerted itself. Weather effects are equally impressive. Rain, sun, and snow – as well as the time of day – have a big impact on the look of the game. Torrential downpours clog up the screen, while sometimes at night you’ll flashes of lightning illuminated the highly-textured road surface. And while it may not be the most densely populated of landscapes, there’s always something to catch the eye.  The story is intentionally incidental. (We’re a long way from the narrative pretensions of the woeful NFS: The Run.) Whether cop or racer, each chapter is structured around a speed list, which is little more than a series of objects. Rivals is eager to get you behind the wheel and onto the tarmac, giving a welcomed sense of urgency, and one of the best things about it is the ease with which you can switch between playing as a cop or a racer. Hot Pursuits – high-speed races with the cops already on your tail – are definitely the pick of the available events. Time trials and races lose their appeal much quicker, especially after you’ve already driven down the same stretch of road countless times. Rivals is tremendous fun, for a while, but once I got to grips with its weapons, unlocked more of its ridiculous cars, and became intimately acquainted with the map, it didn’t have a lot more to really show me. The map is fairly big but when you’re driving at such high speeds, it’s easy to see a big chunk of it in a single pursuit. It definitely continued to excite me, but stopped surprising me quite early on. No matter which side of the law you choose, there’s a garage full of high-powered super cars ranging from Aston Martins to Ferraris waiting for you. Handling is fun, responsive, and accessible – even newcomers will soon be able to slide around tight corners with a little practice. There’s also the option to soup them up, with high-tech gadgetry including spike strips and mines, shockwave blasts, and knuckle-whitening turbo boosts. None of the weapons are particularly memorable or iconic, and while they’re useful, you can’t really beat old-fashioned ramming.  It’s all in the pursuit of unlocking upgrades, and it’s definitely more fun when playing as a racer. There’s more customisation and better toys, such as the preposterous turbo boost, and the way in which you accumulate points is much more engrossing. There’s a simple but effective risk-reward dilemma at play, baiting you to keep racing to build your score multiplier – but if you’re busted, you lose everything. The feeling of being pursued by a six police Ferraris when you’ve got in excess of 100,000 points at risk is when Rivals is at its very best. By comparison, playing as a cop just feels a little staid. If nothing else, being a cop becomes a more attractive proposition when it’s your friends that need busting. Structurally, Rivals’ multiplayer becomes a seamless part of its single-player experience, allowing up to six players to race with or against each other in the same world. You can all be cops, hunting down AI racers, or run from the fuzz together, or even a mixture of the two. You can go head-to-head or do your own thing, until the map brings you together. There are no rules, and it’s enjoyably freeform, though perhaps the size of the map and relatively small number of players allowed is slightly at odds (but somewhat fixed by using fast travel to meet up). Also, for the sake of balance and fairness, it takes much longer to wreck an opponent's car. I also missed some of Most Wanted’s more imaginative multiplayer objectives, like who can pull the longest donut. It’s best to think of Need for Speed: Rivals as a thrill ride. Get on, scream, plead to go faster, and it will. It has some of the best car chases around, and they’ve never looked so chaotically beautiful as they do on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. And if you’ve not played a lot of Hot Pursuit or Most Wanted, it charms will be much more alluring. I was looking for more explorations, depth, and variety, and in this department Rivals is slightly wanting, though it’s innovative approach to incorporating multiplayer does just enough to compensate.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/20/forza-motorsport-5-review	 “Cars. To some, they’re just transport; a convenient alternative to highly flammable dirigibles, or walking,” says Top Gear’s Jeremy Clarkson in Forza Motorsport 5’s pensive intro. But in a monologue not dissimilar to the one he provided to open Forza 4 Clarkson goes on to describe why cars are far more than this. He describes how they represent both the glory of technology and the essence of freedom. He explains how they mark the moments by which we define decades, as on-screen a set of keys is wedged into the palms of a grinning teenager. “Cars are some of the most intoxicating, most beautiful things ever forged by mankind,” he muses. Superficially speaking Forza 5 is just looking to turn us on before we even turn a key, but once you’re inside it’s instantly clear that Forza 5 is here to accelerate Forza’s transition from a series that simply features cars to one that truly celebrates them. The cars here aren’t just thumbnails in a scrolling menu; every one has a history and a reason to admire it. Forza 5 clearly wants to be the defining cocktail of global car culture and it’s a philosophy that’s extends from Clarkson’s slightly wistful opening montage to deep within the guts of career mode. Thanks to a well-chosen bunch of unprecedentedly lavish car models and the help of all three hosts of the UK’s Top Gear, Forza 5 is a virtual love letter to every vehicle it contains. And while the overall track count teeters on the wrong side of thin and the lack of dynamic time or weather stings, it’s one that’s technically very hard to fault.   Featuring just over 200 cars, Forza 5 is several hundred cars shy of Forza 4’s eventual count of well over 600. The important thing is that every car that did scrape into Forza 5 for launch deserves to be here. Iconic classics, from old-school European grand tourers to hulking US muscle and timeless Italian supercars to cult performance hatches and sedans. Cutting-edge current models, from affordable modern rides to today’s money-no-object hypercars. World-famous F1, GT, and touring cars and, for the first time, hardcore open-wheelers like the ludicrous Ariel Atom V8. It’s all wheat and no chaff. Woah. The best place to dribble over them is in Forzavista mode, where they look absolutely remarkable. You can’t pop the hood on everything, but the level of attention paid to even the smallest of details can be downright astonishing. Explore every inch and you’ll find the cars modelled down to manufacturer stickers on the inner-edges of doors. The detail really is something else, from the speckled surface of a steering wheel in an enduring ’90s hatchback to the staggering crispness of the tiny labels accompanying the multitude of switches in a Le Mans Prototype. Forza 4’s Autovista mode already gave us an appetiser of this two years ago so the novelty is suppressed slightly, but the fact that every car can be so closely inspected is exceedingly cool. On track, things are equally impressive. Supremely realistic lighting slides over bodywork, casting impeccable shadows. Brake lights glow more realistically than ever. Flecks of rubber collect on the paintwork. Cosmetic damage doesn’t really handle massive accidents but small scrapes and nudges are well-translated to your car’s panels. You’ll even see specks of different coloured paint from rubbing against opponents. It’s not universally beautiful, though. Small effects like tyre smoke and the puffs of dust kicked up by cars putting a wheel off-track don’t amaze, and the rudimentary pit-stops look uncharacteristically shonky. The audio, however, is uniformly excellent, whether it’s the chirping of tyres under brakes or the throbbing of a helicopter overhead. And the engine notes? Well, they’re better than ever. Turn it up loud; that’s an order. Unsurprisingly, the cars still handle as good as they look and sound. Better, in fact. It’ll certainly feel familiar enough to returning Forza fans, but there’s more nuance to how the cars shift about on their newly modelled suspension and more bite to the way tyres cling to the asphalt. The cars feel more distinct from each other than ever before too; the finesse required to thread a 600bhp, one-and-a-half metric ton V8 Supercar through The Esses across Mount Panorama is very different to the way you need to coax the thoroughly insane, rally-bred Ford RS200 around the famous Top Gear Hammerhead. Of course, it always has been – but here it feels more credible than ever. The way Forza 5’s cars communicate weight is tremendous. The Xbox One controller’s haptic triggers give you feedback on when your wheels are slipping under the throttle and losing grip under braking, and I was surprised at how much this adds to the driving experience. It’ll take you a while before you’re able to try all the cars because there’s been a change to the way we’re allowed access to them. Forza 5’s somewhat neutered free-play mode only lets you use your own garage cars or ‘rent’ one for free from a small selection, and driver levels no longer come with a reward car at every promotion. It’s a bit disappointing, although it does make you think harder about, and become more attached to, the cars you ultimately do buy.  As always, cars can be upgraded, tuned, and painted. The best tunes and designs will be curated and suggested to players, but you can still manually search other players’ designs for the content you’re looking for. I honestly can’t say I was a massive fan of defacing my cars with the admittedly small selection of liveries available during the review period but you don’t have to apply a design. Thankfully, opponent designs can be switched off too, so if you prefer the traditional look over racing against a bunch of gaudy Hot Wheels also-rans you’re covered. The whole reason you’ll be at the mercy of other racers’ tastes in tribal vinyls, however, is because of Forza 5’s seriously cool new Drivatar AI. In single-player, Forza 5 will pit you against opponents which race according to the real-life driving behaviours of the Forza players they’re based on. Racing is a lot more dynamic and unpredictable as a result. Some Drivatar opponents take unconventional lines into corners, and many are happy to pound several cars wide into bends that regular, computer AI would have tracked around in a polite convoy. You can tune the Drivatar difficulty to be just right for your skill. You now just need to finish in the top three to earn gold completion so if you can repress your need to outright win every single race (and instead opt for a level of difficulty that’ll see you occasionally out-raced by the top two or three cars) you’ll be satisfyingly challenged every time you hit the track. As with turning off assists and refraining from the rewind feature, you earn extra XP for increasing the difficulty so it’s totally worth having it set where it’s hard to win but you’re still able to progress. It's also worth mentioning that even when you aren’t playing Forza 5, the AI based on your behaviour is, so each time you log in you’ll collect credits based on your Drivatar’s performance.   Forza 5’s track selection is also down from Forza 4, but the ones that are here are largely very good. New additions like Bathurst and Spa are genuine highlights, and (although the finish line at the former is in the wrong place) the absolute joy to be gleaned from bombing flat out into The Chase at Bathurst or Eau Rouge at Spa cannot be understated. These highly technical, world-class circuits are immensely fun to lap around. Importantly they mostly look as remarkable as the cars. Detail decreases the further off course you look but up close the imperfections on the track surface really sing, and the trackside objects and painted walls really do look realistically weathered. Dynamic time of day is again absent from Forza 5, as is changing weather; two omissions that are beginning to weigh heavily against the series. I will say the early morning sun in several of Forza 5’s tracks probably looks good in screenshots but feels a little overplayed here. I certainly got to a point where I was a bit tired of driving into a blindingly white orb and yearned to take on Mount Panorama at midday rather than 8am.  There are just 14 track locations, so although most have more than one layout the final track count is arguably on the wrong side of light; you’ll generally find yourself hitting the same courses at least once in basically every race series. However, there’s no shortage of stuff to do on the tracks we do have. The varied racing series will keep you busy for a long time, and all of them are introduced by one of the Top Gear lads, who personally explain the significance of the participating cars. The credibility and humour these voiceovers bring to Forza 5 really works, whether it’s Richard Hammond beaming enthusiastically about classic US racing muscle or James May mildly appalled at the inclusion of a VW Beetle. Then there’s the Rivals functionality, returning from Forza 4, which constantly rewards you with cash and XP for beating the player ahead of you and will again encourage many late nights chasing one more ghost. The standalone Rivals Mode features again too, with custom events hinged around certain tracks and cars. Of course, there’s also robust multiplayer for when you want to race real people rather than Skynet versions of them. The racing is fairly typical but it’s also highly customisable. If, like me, you still miss the endurance races, here's where you can set them up. Forza 5 is gorgeous and smooth as butter, and its utterly enchanting handling makes it a joy to drive hard, but this game is more than just a rock solid technical titan for the Xbox One. It’s an essential destination for the automobile obsessed. It may be lighter on girth than where we left off last generation, and still lacking much-requested features like night racing and rain, but wrestling a car through some of the world’s most legendary corners at the very limits of adhesion has never looked or felt this good on console. As a result Forza 5 is a very hard game for a revhead like myself not to love.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/nba-live-14-review	 NBA Live 14 sinks lower than I ever thought this once-proud series could go. Making the totally fair comparison to NBA 2K14 would be like LeBron James playing a pickup game against an arthritic giraffe. But even taken in isolation, the resurrected NBA Live is a mess of a hoops sim both in your hands and in your eyes that wouldn’t even make the D-League All-Star team. In fact, there’s only one thing about NBA Live that’s better than its competitor: the net. Yes, that one thing is the net, and it is the best net I’ve ever seen in a basketball game. There, I said something nice. Of course, the core on-court action has to be at least somewhat appealing for for that beautiful net to matter, and, well…  For an experience built around the basketball itself and the physics that power it, the players handling said rock feel sluggish - as if these ballers only do what you want well after you tell them to. The right-thumbstick dribble mechanics feel good and are reminiscent of the old-school Live’s Freestyle Stick, but they’re often abused, with behind-the-back spins frequently leading to dunks or layups. Speaking of which, dunks from anyone and everyone are far too common -- the mid-range jump shot is mostly absent from Live 14’s repertoire, probably because jumpers have a freakish tendency to get blocked no matter who’s doing the shooting. It’s a shame, because underneath the garbage heap of problems are a couple of promising features. Big Moments mode includes compelling challenges that recreate rare real-life achievements or big shots. We’ve seen this in other sports games, but Live’s clever hook is that fresh ones are supposed to be added as they happen in the actual NBA season. For instance, I was able to play Jeff Green’s buzzer-beating game-winning three against the Heat just days after it went down in Miami.  Meanwhile, NBA Live borrows the virtual-trading-card-based Ultimate Team mode from FIFA and applies it to pro hoopsters, creating the only other thing besides Big Moments that I’d be tempted to keep coming back to. In it, you unlock (or buy) new packs of cards and build a better team with which to challenge online foes. The Rising Star mode isn’t so skilled. It follows 2K’s MyPlayer blueprint closely, right down to opening with a Draft Showcase game, then getting drafted, and then playing your first game and getting scored for every little good or bad thing you do in the contest. Problem is, it’s a lot easier to fail than it is to succeed. You’ll lose rating not just for turnovers and poor defense, but for every missed shot, even if it was a clean, open look that came from great ball movement. Come on, even the best NBA player only makes half of his shots! Worse, you’re not rewarded for drawing a foul or even making the free throws you’ve earned once you get to the line. And the Dynasty mode is a menu-tastic, ho-hum take on the traditional front-office-managing Franchise mode. Nothing more, nothing less. Sorry you're on the cover of this one, Kyrie. Things get worse when you stop looking at menus and start squinting at the graphics. The crowd looks PS3-ish. Players lack texture detail, definition, emotion, and lighting; they’re all encased in a white glow that looks like it came out of a PlayStation 2 game. Animations are stiff and unnatural. These guys look anything but alive. And when you do pull off something cool, almost every replay -- many of which suffer from framerate issues that live gameplay doesn’t -- is a view from the rafters or, if it is closer, shows you the backs of the players’ heads. It’s almost as if NBA Live 14 knows how ugly it is and is deathly afraid that we’ll find out. The poopy presentation extends to the audio, too. ESPN integration means Mike Breen and Jeff Van Gundy are doing the play-by-play, but they seem to always be fresh out of stories and rarely call out players by name, instead opting for generic pronouns like “he” or basic descriptions such as “this team.” Commentary like this hasn’t been acceptable in a decade. And the SportsCenter-style halftime show hosted by Jalen Rose has good stuff in it -- namely Top Plays and the ESPN Wired scenes that drop contextually appropriate, real-life coach-in-the-huddle audio into your game -- but it’s buried inside a tiresome, eternal four-minute sequence (yes, I timed it). NBA Live’s flaccid return is made all the more disappointing because we waited three years for it. After all that time, NBA Live 14 in no way advances the basketball sim genre and, worse, leaves little to be optimistic about for next year. Here’s hoping EA figures something out, otherwise this series’ comeback is going to be short-lived.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/dead-rising-3-review	 When I finally completed Dead Rising 3, the kill counter in the corner of my screen read 26,978. Also I was wearing a luchador mask for some reason. But anyway, that’s a really big number. It’s like killing one zombie per second for seven and a half hours, though I played far longer than that. The fact that I’m still ready and willing to go for another round with a co-op buddy is a good sign that Dead Rising 3 is packing enough variety and goofy action to make it a good time.  Notice that I didn’t say it was pretty. Dead Rising 3 runs at an upscaled 720p resolution, it doesn’t have amazing textures outside of its cinematics, and it suffers from regular framerate stutters and occasional walls that pop in after you’ve driven into them. It doesn’t look a whole lot better than what you’ve probably played on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3.   Instead, it’s big on quantity. I have never seen this many zombies on screen at once in any game. Up close, there are enough distinct character models that I didn’t really feel like I was killing the same one 27,000 times, and I love the many ways in which they fall apart. You can chop them in half (horizontally or vertically!) blow off limbs and heads, and even take out chunks of torso. They put on quite a show. They’re fun and easy to kill - easy enough that charging into the horde and bashing away with a sweet new weapon is a great way to build up experience. But you’ve got to know when to quit, because the zombie horde never will. Especially at night, when zombies are at their angriest, fear kicked in whenever I was stuck in the middle of a horde and my health dwindled into the red zone. But, since you can now save anywhere (unless you’re playing in Nightmare mode) the worst part about dying in Dead Rising 3 isn’t losing progress. It’s finger-tapping your way through the 45-second loading times. Combat is a simple system of light and heavy attacks, but it’s the over-the-top animations and different effects of 300-plus weapons that really sustain it over the course of a 30-hour game. I never really got a chance to get sick of any one weapon, since they all break after a short period of use, and that forces you to mix it up. Getting to use something like the Freedom Bear automated machine gun turret takes effort, and that makes them feel special. I love how most of Dead Rising 3’s collectibles are blueprints for crafting new weaponry instead of meaningless achievement padding. The recipes get positively goofy, like turning microwaves into laser beams, strapping a car battery to a mask of Street Fighter’s Blanka to create area-of-effect electricity attacks, and yes, turning a flashlight into a full-on lightsaber. There’s also a character upgrade system that’s extensive and well done, with most options on the menu providing real benefits that you can feel right away instead of minor stat boosts.    What’s weird about the story - or weirdest, I should say - is that main character Nick Ramos can’t decide whether he knows he’s in a zombie movie parody or not. One minute he’s lamenting that he had to take human life, the next he’s putting on a sombrero and turning a leaf blower into a gun that launches sex toys at lethal velocity. The inconsistency feels weird if you play it straight, but the big laughs come when you mess with his wardrobe and he attempts to be dramatic while wearing an afro wig and a miniskirt. Beyond that, it’s pretty much zombie cliche all the way (though in a parody that's kind of the point). Oh, and there’s no timed hunt for Zombrex this time, but you do have to push the story along every so often or the town blows up. The acting is respectable, even with minor characters. Each companion has their own sidequest fetch job you have to do, like tracking down lost items or escorting them to a location, but along with their color commentary when they’re on your team, those background stories gives them great context and personality. There's Dwayne, the cop who wants access to the police station's armory, Kelsey, the country girl who needs help finding her family, Troy, the reformed gangster muscle who can't beat you so he joins you, and many more. I didn't even see a third of them, but all are fully voice acted. That character development makes it more memorable when you get them permanently killed.  Fortunately, you don’t have to babysit them too much - if you run from a fight, they'll generally run with you - and it’s hilarious to gear them all up with weapons and watch them go to work. But, after many hours of having fun with them, I decided I was better off finishing the campaign solo. Companions get in your way a lot, blocking doors, making items hard to pick up, and standing next to that zombie you're trying to bash. They won't turn on you if you accidentally hit them too many times like Dead Rising 2's companions, at least. The other notable characters are the Psychos, which are optional boss battles. They aren’t all that impressively designed, but they are the most interesting and grotesque villains, like an organ-harvesting doctor or a hideously obese woman in a Rascal scooter who murders anyone who gets close to her buffet.   Dead Rising 3’s open-world map is full of interesting and distinctively detailed locations to explore, including tons of shops, homes, tennis courts, a police station, and lots more. In places, it genuinely feels like a world hit by a sudden zombie outbreak. Its biggest problem, though, is that it’s not very large, especially when you’re traveling by car, and it attempts to mask that issue by placing lots of roadblocks everywhere in order to lengthen your route. But the map is often either wrong about whether a route is drivable, or just tough to read. There's no line guiding you to your destination, either, and getting on and off of the freeway in the northern half of the map in particular is a nightmare. I had to spend way too much time in the map screen trying to figure out how to get where I was going, and even more trying to figure out where I went wrong.  Everything works the same way in the drop-in co-op, except better because there are two of you. I’ve already had some great moments, like when my partner plowed through a crowd of zombies in a van to save me when I got in too deep, and driving some of the craftable vehicles that come equipped with turrets. (Weirdly, you can't shoot out the passenger-side window of a regular car.) I’m looking forward to playing a lot more of that. Dead Rising 3 doesn’t get by on its looks, but its meaty zombie-slaying combat and nearly endless supply of undead and ridiculous weapons go a long way. Through its lengthy campaign, I was always eager to see what crazy zombie-squishing contraption would come along next. It rarely disappointed, except when navigating its snarled map and waiting out its load times took me out of the fight took too long.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	 Bunkered down amidst the flash and bluster of the other big-name launch games in the Xbox One catalogue is Powerstar Golf, an arcade-style golf game that could easily pass as an Xbox 360 game... because well, that’s apparently what it was originally supposed to be. It’s by no means a game to get if you want to show off your new hardware, but despite its last-gen looks Powerstar Golf’s RPG-like progression system and asynchronous multiplayer present an addictive and mostly fun way to spoil a good virtual walk.   While its swing timer-based gameplay has clearly been borrowed from the Everybody’s Golf  (AKA Hot Shots Golf) series, Powerstar Golf forgoes the super-deformed anime art style of Sony’s franchise in favour of a more Pixar-like aesthetic. Ex-astronaut Frank even resembles a reskinned Mr. Incredible, which is fitting because all of the characters possess their own unique super power. These powers are limited and must be replenished via the in-game store (using either in-game credits or real-world currency), and range from temporary boosts to your shot distance or slowing down the swing timer, to more creative perks such as Henry the illusionist’s magic ball that splits into five balls after you’ve hit it. These powers never feel essential to your progress, but they’re fun to use and can be handy when attempting a risky approach. Unfortunately the course design doesn’t really match the over-the-top nature of Powerstar’s player roster. While each of the four courses are aesthetically pleasing enough - one is set in and around Japanese castles and cherry blossom trees, another appears to be based off the Rocky Mountains - the actual holes themselves are for the most part fairly standard. They still present plenty of challenge with varying topography and typical traps like water hazards and bunkers, but perhaps introducing some more fantastical elements in the vein of Nintendo’s Mario Golf series would have made each set of 18 holes a bit more memorable. I also found that the ambient visual effects would occasionally interfere with my shot and cause frustration, specifically when a dust particle or the shadow of a moving monorail would pass across the screen behind the swing timer and distract my eyes while I was trying to time my three button presses. Again, it’s rare that this happens, but annoying all the same.   What really prevents Powerstar Golf from being a forgettable golf experience is the smartly implemented experience and upgrade system that hooked me like a crooked 3-iron. XP is earned from almost every action you perform on the course, and you’re constantly bombarded with on-the-spot challenges to unlock chunky XP bonuses, such achieving par or better on three consecutive holes or landing an approach shot within a short distance to the pin. As you level up and earn more prize money, you can buy ‘booster’ perks for you and your caddie, with each of them applying modifiers such as hook and slice reduction or the ability to skim a ball across a surface of water. You can also buy gear packs in order to gain new clubs, clothes and balls, although it’s a little strange that the content of each gear pack is randomised so you don’t really know what you’re going to get until after you’ve already paid for it (admittedly a system that will be familiar for fans of Pokemon and the like).  Every stroke you play on each hole is measured against record-holders from around the world, and in a nice touch the Xbox One will automatically record video of your shot should you set a new record yourself. But where the Xbox Live user data really comes into play is via the Rivals mode, an asynchronous multiplayer mode that lets you play rounds of golf against the recordings of other players’ best outings on each hole. Instead of playing Everybody’s Golf, you’re essentially playing against everybody else’s golf. Rivals mode is kind of like a substantially less dynamic version of Forza 5’s ‘Driveatar’ tech - essentially the golfing equivalent of Mario Kart ghost racing - but nonetheless presents what will potentially be a much stiffer challenge as real-world players keep leveling up and learning each hole, and particularly since the AI opponents are prone to dubious shot selection at times. As a side bonus, if your golfer ghosts beats another player, you can essentially earn XP even when you’re not actually playing. Powerstar Golf manages to successfully marry an old-school arcade golf experience with some decidedly new-school ideas. The lack of proper online multiplayer is a bit of a blow, but the Rivals mode has the potential to provide an ongoing challenge after you’ve scooped up all of the career medals. It’s not a complete hole in (Xbox) One for golf fans, but it’s a good deal of fun if you desperately want to hit the links on your new machine.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/crimson-dragon-review	 The idea of riding a dragon is inherently cool, but lackluster textures and dull sound effects were all I could see when playing Crimson Dragon. Instead of feeling like I’m controlling a powerful beast, this mostly on-rails shooter feels more like flying a kite. It’s not a bad shooter, but it comes with major caveats like a few frustrating encounters, repetitive environments, and heavy doses of RPG-like grinding. When you’re just flying and shooting, Crimson Dragon handles fine, but doesn’t do anything special. The constant stream of dragon fire doesn’t feel powerful for the first five or six hours. Most stages play out like fun roller coaster rides, and the controls are traditional and intuitive. The camera helpfully moves around your dragon and keeps track of where enemies are, for the most part.  Developers Grounding and Land Ho! integrated a fairly deep RPG upgrade structure where feeding dragons unlocks special moves. Each dragon has an affinity like Fire, Wind, Light, etc, but fortunately they aren’t pigeonholed to those types – so a fire-based creature can learn wind attacks, for example. The repetitive structure did start to wear on me before a new dragon was added to my stable, but at least that comes with the enticing possibility of discovering a bigger dragon with better stats and stronger abilities. The rider also has an independent leveling system that unlocks more dragons for purchase, but it takes a long time to land anything powerful. Replaying levels or starting new ones is the only way to increase a rider level. But the fact that Crimson Dragon reuses so many areas causes repetition to set in quickly. And you have to constantly revisit these areas in order to discover the required random drop that will let you into the next stage. It’s in the more open timed levels against bosses that things lead to frustration. These free-flying stages take you off the rails, but don’t give you the tools you need to navigate that way. You can speed up or slow down but never really stop or hover, so I’d constantly sail past a boss’ weak points over and over again… until time expired. I like the challenge of a difficult fight, but when it’s a clock that beats me instead of the enemy, it takes some of the fun out of battle. It helps a bit that maps are small, but a simple hover function would have made things much less frustrating.  With the gold you earn from completing levels, you can hire Assistant wingmen to back you up in battle, but ultimately they feel like a flimsy waste of money. The big problem is that their stats aren’t good enough to be useful. Two dragons are better than one, but in timed missions and evasive bosses would get away because the two of us just weren’t strong enough to defeat it. Sometimes I would luck out and find a more capable wingman with a name like “Kickassius Clay.” Other times, they were so bad I wished a flying oversized enemy would put our miserable team out of commission. Usually, they did. Crimson Dragon works well enough as a straight arcade shooter, and there’s plenty of challenge in it. There’s some nostalgic value, too, but it’s weak graphics and frustrating free-flight boss fights make it tough to enjoy the stroll down memory lane.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/lococycle-review	 Video games are essentially creative blank checks where almost any concept, no matter how zany, can work. LocoCycle embraces that idea with a rare abandon. In a vacuum, the fact that you’re controlling a sentient motorcycle with an unwilling human passenger inexplicably and irreversibly stuck to the tailpipe might seem impossibly strange, but mere minutes into the accompanying short film, it becomes clear that we left Kansas back at the start menu. Its Short Circuit-esque plot is often funny, and its mix of different gameplay types can be entertaining in spots, but both suffer from a pervasive lack of consistency and cohesion that ultimately derails what could have been a delightfully crazy train.  At the surface level, LocoCycle mixes equal parts arcadey driving, shooting, and brawling, but each of its 17 levels contextualizes these actions in a slew of different ways. You might be racing to bust through a nearby roadblock, or tossing your along-for-the-ride mechanic Pablo out to intercept a wing of rocket-sled-riding bombers. You’re never stuck doing the same thing for long, and as you progress through the three to four hour-long story mode, you’ll be regularly treated to new locations and scenery. But while the variety of gameplay types is nice, not every encounter is created equal, and when they do start repeating, it’s with too little variance. Any given set piece will be nearly identical in the later levels as when it was initially introduced. This would be less of an issue if so many of them didn’t become rote after completing them the first time, but when certain sequences boil mostly down to mashing a single button without any regard for timing, things get monotonous quickly. It also doesn’t help that both the camera and controls have a way of shifting from battle to battle, and sometimes even moment to moment, changing how IRIS (our motorcycle/protagonist) handles, and arbitrarily locking out or adding combat options without notification. At best, she feels like one of the nimble Generation 2 Transformers bikes that likely inspired her look, but just as often, she feels either too squirrely or too sluggish to get into a groove with. And for every section that worked, like the Thunderblade-style top-down shooting sequence, there’s at least one that doesn't, such as the Street Fighter sequence near the story's climax. What’s worse, all these disparate parts are strung together haphazardly without any sense of progressive challenge. Some levels went on for what seemed like forever, only to unceremoniously end with an anti-climactic sequence all too similar to what had come before it. Meanwhile, the wonderfully campy live-action short film that's interwoven throughout quickly establishes a tone of absurdity that frees developer Twisted Pixel up to do just about anything: from explosive midget-tossing to grilled cheese sandwich biker gang celebrations. There’s an unhinged sort of imagination driving things forward at all times, and even when LocoCycle made mistakes (which it does regularly) its spirit of silliness kept a smile on my face.  Whether you’re playing or watching, LocoCycle aspires to present itself like a movie, and in this regard it mostly succeeds. Though the graphics are underwhelming for what I expected from an Xbox One game, the sound design is uniformly excellent, and slick camera transitions between quick time events and real-time gameplay sell the summer popcorn flick vibe. The 90s were the last time when sentient robotic motorcycles could possibly have been cool, and LocoCycle pays a humorous homage to the era with references to numerous D-list 90s films. Lisa Foiles threads a needle between Johnny 5 and GLaDOS with her performance as IRIS, and Robert Patrick hams it up as Spike, who plays KARR to her KITT. Both of them sound like they’re having a blast – particularly Foiles, whose energetic quips carry the proceedings. Where LocoCycle's Hollywood aspirations get into some trouble is with Pablo, IRIS’ Spanish-speaking mechanic. While the story manages to contextualize why he doesn’t speak English, and why IRIS can’t speak Spanish, he still winds up being a one-note character who simply begs for his life from beginning to end.  There’s undercurrents of political satire – with shots taken at partisan politics, and U.S. hyper-nationalism - but just when I thought LocoCycle was trying to say something, it'd make a taco reference or a mental health joke and pass the commentary right by. Given Twisted Pixel’s track record, I want to believe there was a message here, but I couldn’t quite shake the feeling that Pablo was there to be laughed at, not with, and that made me more than a little uncomfortable. If nothing else, LocoCycle earns its name. It’s got not one, but two sentient motorcycles, and buckets full of loco. I imagine I’ll have forgotten what LocoCycle played like long before I forget its unapologetically zany live-action bits, and its questionable treatment of Pablo. Its inconsistent gameplay becomes tedious despite its imaginative variety, and its levels lack cohesion or a sense of momentum. Like the cheesy 90's films it apes, LocoCycle is memorable, but not quite good.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	 It's been said that you can never have too much of a good thing, but how much is enough? This is the question I kept asking myself as I poured hour upon gleeful hour into Killer Instinct. In a fighting game, how many characters is too few? How much can I really get out of it without an arcade or story mode? Quite a lot, it turns out. KI makes up for its modestly sized cast of just six characters by offering scads of unlockables, excellent training modes, and most importantly, a combat system that’s as fun and flashy as it is smart.  Killer Instinct's combat is fluid, deep, and well informed by the mistakes of its predecessors. Double Helix has done a great job of staying true to KI’s roots while also solving the problem of long-form combos being one-way interactions where one person plays while the other watches. Killer Instinct employs an intelligent system of interlocking mechanics to instead make combos a natural extension of the neutral game. It starts with the ever-familiar combo breaker, which has been modified to reward both good reads and sharp reactions. Learning what every character’s linkers and auto-doubles (KI’s combo building blocks) look like is essential since you have to match them with the appropriate combo breaker input. Choosing the wrong input, or even mistiming the right one temporarily “locks” you out from any further attempts, giving your attacker time to go nuts. This makes choosing whether or not to break a meaningful decision while giving the attacker further reason to switch up their combos instead of using the same bread and butter every time. The new counter-breaker adds another layer of tactics, giving smart attackers a way to bait out and punish predictable break attempts for big damage. Of course, a smarter defender could sniff the trap out, refrain from breaking, and punish the whiffed counter breaker. But then, a still-smarter attacker might drop out of the combo intentionally before any of that happens and go for a reset, starting a brand new combo with the built-up potential damage from the original one. It’s a non-stop cycle of mind games that keeps both players dialed into the match, regardless of who’s hitting who. And for as combo-centric as it can be, KI's neutral game is remarkably sound. Footsies are entirely viable, anti-airs are threatening, and smart meter-management can win matches. Each of KI’s six characters feels distinctive and fully developed: Jago offers players with strong fundamentals an option for every situation; Sabrewulf dominates with a speedy high-low mixup game but makes you work to get in close enough to use it; Glacius is the exact opposite, controlling large amounts of space from medium and long ranges but struggling once opponents get in his face. Rounding out the cast are Orchid, Thunder, and finally Sadira – a series newcomer with incredible aerial mixup options. The one upshot of having such a small cast is that it's easier to balance, but at the end of the day, it's still only six characters - it's hard not to feel a bit limited by that.  An endless survival mode stands in for the absent arcade mode as Killer Instinct’s de facto way to pummel a string of CPU opponents. There’s also a long list of increasingly difficult optional trials to complete that net you points to unlock tons of extra goodies. These bite-sized challenges are listed right on the main menu, and clicking on one conveniently drops you into the relevant mode with whatever character you're supposed to use. I play fighting games to fight and improve, so heading into practice mode to build a better combo or challenging myself to beat my best win streak with a particular character is already what I want to be doing - Killer Instinct's trials simply add structure and incentive to it. Personally, I found that more interesting than any arcade or story mode. But the real crown jewels are the modes dedicated to educating fledgling pugilists. For beginners, the path to enlightenment begins in Dojo mode, a series of 32 multi-part lessons that cover everything from basic movement and defense to more advanced concepts, like how to read and apply frame data. The information is presented in an easily digestible way, with well-written descriptions accompanied by CPU demonstrations. It amounts to two or three hours of content, and by the time you’re done you won’t just understand Killer Instinct – you’ll understand fighting games.  Intermediate and advanced players get some wonderful toys as well. Practice mode can be set to provide frame data, combo state indicators, and even hitbox displays all at once, giving you an unprecedented level of real-time technical info. Better still, you can turn most of it on while watching replays of both your online and offline matches, which are automatically recorded and archived for you as you play. You can watch at half speed, or even pause and advance frame by frame to really break down tricky exchanges and situations. It’s an exhaustive suite of tools that would be impressive at any price, but you get all of it with the free version of Killer Instinct. The original arcade versions of KI were known for their high production values and over-the-top style. This latest incarnation only gets half of that right. During matches, impressive particle effects shower the battlefield as dynamic self-shadowing and aggressive lighting help lend the gorgeous backdrops a sense of place - all while running at an unflinching 60fps. But where the original cast was memorable in a cheesy 90s sci-fi kind of way, their new designs don’t fare quite as well. Jago looks less like a ninja and more like a goofy cross between a monk and a Roman soldier, while Thunder’s design could believably have been ripped from a different game entirely. It’s like a high-end sports car with an awkwardly-shaped body and a spectacular coat of paint. The sad truth about fighting games is that much of what makes playing them against others interesting is usually kept obscured. Killer Instinct succeeds enormously at exposing all of that information to players of all skill levels. Not only is its combat system flashy and well thought out, it's well explained too, thanks to its powerful training tools, and what is easily the most complete guide to terminology and tactics ever assembled in a fighting game. Though it lacks an arcade mode or a full-sized character roster, Killer Instinct delivers where it counts.
Bobby Amos	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/15/madden-nfl-25-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	 I’m a long-time Madden NFL fan who’s been with the series through its highs, like when Madden 2003 added online play, and its lows, like when they added Gameflow in Madden 11. When I got my hands on the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions of Madden 25, at first I liked a lot of what I saw, including some really good player AI. But after a few games, I started noticing more and more problems with how these players handle, and those dogpiled on top of each other. Right now, if I’ve got to pick between the next-gen version and the current-gen one? I’d rather play Madden 25 on an Xbox 360 or a PlayStation 3.  Obviously, Madden 25 looks a bit better on a next-gen console. It still won’t be winning any awards for bigtime graphical advancements, but it does have some pretty cool touches around the field. The stadiums feel alive, and the days of flat and blurry crowds are over. Whenever I broke a long touchdown run, the crowd made me feel like I had just done something grand. And when the home crowd isn’t happy with how their team is performing, you’ll definitely hear it. All the cutaways to the sidelines to show coaches and players are satisfying, and EA deserves to be proud about how good they look. But they shouldn’t have had it happen quite so often, because some of the player interactions have gotten repetitive already, and even though character models look much sharper in 1080p resolution, we’re in serious uncanny valley territory here. There’s something kinda off about these guys, and not just their soulless facial expressions. I’m not a fan of how a lot of the players look: everyone has extremely long legs and small torsos, and it just looks generic to me. A couple of guys are particularly bad. For example, the 49ers’ Colin Kapernick doesn’t sport any of his trademark body ink, and I didn’t even recognize Kansas City Chiefs star running back, Jamaal Charles. I just kept saying, “There’s no way that’s Jamaal Charles, there’s no way!” He doesn’t look like that. Here’s another weird thing: every so often it seems like player animations speed up. They’re moving unnaturally fast, and it was screwing up my timing on offense. This isn’t a framerate issue – they’re just moving really fast.  The Xbox One and PS4 versions of Madden 25 have all the exact same features and modes I like in the 360 and PS3 versions. The Connected Franchise is a fun game mode to enjoy with a big group of friends, and Ultimate Team is a cool way to play with all your favorite players at once. That’s a strong foundation. Where it’s different is in the little things, and some are better than others. I’ve always wondered how much a player's awareness and ability ratings really affected the game, but now you can plainly see it: these next-gen players are definitely smarter, and I really like watching how they react to real football situations. Watching Champ Bailey defensively dissect one of my offensive plays was great. I planned on throwing an out route to my receiver for a first down, but Champ read the play and made his move right as I started my throwing motion. By the time the ball arrived he was already in position to pick it off and head the other way for a touchdown. All I could say was damn – that's exactly the sort of thing he used to do in his prime. The same thing could be said about the 49ers' corner, Tarell Brown: one time, I called a cover 2 defensive play and I was controlling the middle linebacker. I watched as he passed the receiver off to the closest defender, and immediately he recognized the tight end running a route to the flat. Before the quarterback even threw the ball, he broke toward the area where the tight end was heading and stepped in front of the ball for a pick six. Good player AI like this forces you to make better choices when your offense, and that’s another area where this Madden does it right. You can see this player awareness in other ways, too: for example, any self-respecting fan knows that the game of football is won and lost in the trenches. In the replays, you can see the offensive and defensive lines counter each other decisions, and that’s really cool. But I wish it was more noticeable when you’re actually playing.  For me though, where Madden 25 makes its big fumble is in how EA changed the running game. I fancy myself a decent runner - in Madden on 360 and PS3, I enjoy following my blockers to make one cut and run for daylight. However, on Xbox One and PS4, far too many times I’ve had my runner slow down, shuffle his feet, and lose momentum while trying get around the defender. Yeah, that’s how they do it in real life, but I didn’t feel like I was in control of the player. At times it felt like Madden might be getting too realistic for it’s own good. It may be a better simulation, but it also makes playing less fun.  Madden games catch a lot of flack for not changing enough every year, but here’s an example of why change isn’t always a good thing. The next-gen versions add more detail pretty much everywhere, but in the end it makes me have to fight for control of my players and worry about little things that aren’t that interesting. On the current-gen versions I feel like I’m in complete control of everything, from passing to running, and that I can trust both the offensive and defensive line so I can focus on overall strategy. But this new version of Madden 25 meddles with the running game and it screws up the delicate balance between pass and run. Once EA manages to combine all this lifelike ambience and smarter players with responsive control of current-gen Madden, I’ll be a lot happier with the new generation.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	 NBA 2K14 on PS4 and Xbox One practically sells itself. I mean, look at it. Look. At. It. Here is a game whose visuals are so beautifully realistic that you almost have to stop and try it, regardless of how much you like basketball. Not since Fight Night Round 3 in 2006 has a sports game lured me in with its stunning graphics and kept me hooked with rock-solid gameplay the way NBA 2K14 is capable of doing. Only the new set of modes unique to this version of the game, which differ but don’t quite deliver on their full potential, keep next-gen 2K14 from dethroning its cousin. Laudably, the new 2K14 and its smart AI and NBA-accurate pacing plays almost exactly like the excellent 360 and PS3 version -- complete with this year’s new Assist Pass and improved dribbling controls. That’s a disappointment to anyone hoping for a whole new experience from the new generation of consoles, but it’s hard to complain that it plays like one of the best basketball games ever. I only have a couple of issues. First, the ball behaves like its own physics object now, and seemingly because of that it ends up loose or bouncing off a guy’s back more often than it should in a game about pro ball players. Also, though the players look and feel noticeably more planted to the court and less floaty than we’re used to, I still occasionally caught someone magnetizing over to his nearby assignment.  And then there’s the obvious: NBA 2K14 is sexy. But why? Running 1080p resolution at a smooth 60 frames per second on both consoles establishes a gorgeous foundation, but it’s the attention to detail -- always a calling card of this series but dialed up an extra notch here -- that guarantees you rubbernecking roommates anytime you play it. The players -- and for the first time, coaches -- look convincingly realistic. More importantly, they move that way too. Animations both big and small -- everything from myriad dunks to Ray Allen’s smirk when he nails a big three-pointer -- sell the realism, as does 2K14’s array of lifelike facial animations. The players look alive -- it’s not quite a T-1000 level of convincing, but it’s damn impressive. Rounding out the impeccable broadcast-style presentation, the usual Kevin Harlan-led commentary crew is as on-point as ever, but the addition of sideline reporter Doris Burke’s interviews with a player or coach at halftime and the end of the game -- where you hear a contextually accurate real-life voice clip, lip-synched and all -- is something I can’t help but be impressed by. The biggest graphical sin is when something goes visually awry in a game that looks so amazing -- for instance, one of the infrequent but far-from-rare clipping bugs -- because it really, really stands out, like a glitch in The Matrix.  Though it bears the same name, NBA 2K14 on next-gen is, in fact, a totally different package than the one that released in October for PS3 and Xbox 360. Instead of the LeBron Path to Greatness and Crews, the next-gen version introduces several new modes (and a refreshingly simplified redesign of the menus). Notably, MyCareer has you create a player and take him through a everything from a pre-draft showcase to Draft Night to working your way up from benchwarmer to starter. It’s loaded with fully acted cutscenes and played-up drama, and much of it is laughably cheesy. Neither the dialogue nor the voice acting can ever be taken seriously, and when you get accosted by an angry DeMarcus Cousins (since I was drafted by the Kings) after a game for not getting him the ball, it’s especially jarring when he’s a mute who speaks only in subtitles. MyGM is a fresh, considered take on the age-old franchise mode. You control everything from roster moves to coaching staff to budget to hot dog and merchandise prices, and you have to keep your owner, coaches, players, fans, and the media happy along the way. It’s deep and gets rather engrossing, though you won’t earn many GM-related unlocks (such as influence in contract negotiations) unless you go in and play the games yourself, which adds a ton of time to a mode that should allow me to focus on the off-court parts of the NBA if I want to. And Park is an evolution of the Blacktop mode from NBA 2K on 360 and PS3; in this incarnation, up to 100 players on each server can either play or be waiting for the next game in either 2-on-2 halfcourt, three-quarters-court 3-on-3, or full-court 5-on-5, all with custom-created MyCareer hoopsters. The three-on-three is the sweet spot for me, as everyone gets involved enough (including on-mic trash talk) without the streakiness that a 2-on-2 halfcourt match is prone to or the chaos of a 5-on-5 showdown. But it needs more structure; you can’t form crews or leagues, or otherwise conveniently meet up and play together unless you coordinate externally through your console’s Friends list. If you skipped current-gen this year, it’s a no-brainer: yes, yes, yes, yes. Next-gen NBA 2K14’s ambitious new modes each leave a bit to be desired, and for better and for worse, it plays almost identically to the game you may already own. But this edition is not only a smooth-flowing piece of pro basketball simulation, it’s also one of the few games that makes a true next-generation leap in visual fidelity. And when you’re dropping $400-$500 on a fresh piece of hardware, there’s something to be said for that.
Scott Lowe	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	 Like a good sequel should, Call of Duty: Ghosts doesn’t ignore the formula of fast, fluid gameplay that has made the series famous, but introduces a unique new premise, unprecedented player personalization, and sweeping changes that breathe new life into the multiplayer experience. It’s over-the-top and at times unnecessarily complex, but serves both current and next-generation consoles with ambitious new ideas and tremendous replay value. Despite sharing a name with one of Modern Warfare’s best-known characters, Ghosts takes place in an entirely new Call of Duty universe set in the not-too-distant future. In a genre overwrought with antiquated Russian conflicts and ambiguous Middle Eastern terrorist threats, Ghosts takes on a refreshingly unique premise in which the threat comes not from the east, but the south: a federation of oil-rich South American nations rises to take over the hemisphere, pushing north and coming to blows with the U.S.  The prelude establishes a harrowing vision of a United States homeland that's broken but not beaten – not quite Red Dawn, but not Fallout 3, either. It’s a space not often explored by modern shooters, and its mood is heightened by missions set in a besieged Santa Monica and the wasted remains of San Diego, to the tune of an excellent, somber score from David Buckley (The Town, Metal Gear Solid 4). But ultimately, time on the poignant homefront is short lived as the story goes behind enemy lines in Caracas, the Andes mountains, and other exotic locales. Those might lack to familiarity, but the variety of environments keeps the campaign fresh, not only in terms of visuals, but in gameplay as well. Instead of just fighting waves of enemies through a linear stage at ground level, you’ll find yourself rappelling down skyscrapers, flying helicopters, having firefights in space, commanding tanks, scuba diving through shipwrecks, playing as a dog, and evading shark attacks. Each requires new strategy, acute situational awareness, and – in the case of the space and water missions – special consideration for verticality and physics. Of course, it wouldn’t be a Call of Duty game without elaborate setpieces, fierce shootouts, and tense stealth missions, and Ghosts delivers some of the most memorable experiences in the series. I felt genuine dread as the ground and buildings collapsed around me during orbital weapons strikes, the zero-gravity spectacle of the Federation’s space station ambush is awe-inspiring, and bursting through a highrise window as the entire building crumbles during the Federation Day mission is exhilarating.  But like previous CoDs, the story of Ghosts struggles to remain in focus amidst the fray of explosive cinematic moments and relentless firefights. Narrated loading sequences with stylized story animations push the campaign forward, but only last for one or two minutes before launching back into the action. It’s there, on the front lines, that much of the plot progression is presented and oftentimes lost. It's by no means an achievement in dramatic storytelling — it's more about dumb fun — and it lacks the player-choice element introduced with Call of Duty: Black Ops II, but when given time to breathe Ghosts actually offers some interesting human drama. The story centers around two brothers, Logan and Hesh, their father Elias, and yes, their dog Reilly as they fight the Federation as part of the battered remnants of the U.S. military, and later as the elite Ghosts squad. The family ties, specifically the relationship between Logan and Hesh, made me care about the protagonists in a series that's habitually made its characters a dispensable commodity. The voice acting is decent overall, though there are periodic moments of cringe-worthy dialog, like one superfluous moment when Elias reveals he’s a member of the Ghosts. And then there’s Riley. Though the subject of many a meme at this point, Riley not only acts as a useful tool for recon and silently dispatching enemies, but is integral to several dramatic sequences, saving your character on more than one occasion. The story stumbles in the second act when it strays away from the more evocative character focus in favor of a long stretch of back-to-back missions driven almost exclusively by guns-blazing combat. While not poorly done, this visually arresting, action-packed, but ultimately hollow middle stands in stark contrast to the effective first and final acts. On the bright side, that padded out my play time to roughly 10 hours, making this campaign one of the longest CoD single-player experiences.  Or, in the case of those for whom multiplayer is the primary focus, it handily gets out of the way other than to serve as the inspiration for map environments, equipment, and weapon design. Ghosts preserves much of the look and feel of the traditional Call of Duty multiplayer experience, but introduces sweeping changes that make it more personalized, more diverse, and better balanced. At its core lies the expansive new Create a Soldier system, which affords us the ability to create and customize 10 unique characters, each with up to six loadouts, for a total of 60 available classes and 20,000 possible configurations. Create a Soldier also riffs on Black Ops II’s Pick 10 system, allowing you to forego certain equipment in order to outfit a primary weapon with extra attachments or enable extra perks. In all, there are an impressive 39 weapons, 12 pieces of equipment, 35 new perks, 36 scorestreaks spanning three categories, and various weapons attachments to choose from. Create a Solider is ambitious in its scope, and the sheer breadth of options caters to and empowers every style of play. Whether you want to run around like a high-powered knife-wielding mutant or move stealthily through a map by using heightened senses, you can. But for all of its versatility, Create a Soldier is dauntingly complex next to previous Call of Duty games. Even after hours of matches and experimentation, I felt as though I had only begun to understand the nuances of each of the 35 unique perks and how to optimize my classes for a specific style of play. On the one hand, Create a Soldier’s depth will have enthusiast players honing their perfect loadouts for months, but on the other, it makes for a more challenging entry-level experience.  It's a credit to developer Infinity Ward that even while running around with a maxed-out weapon and the best complimentary perks I could find, at no point did I see a player gain a noticeable advantage. Unlike Black Ops II, which favors lightweight SMGs, Ghosts’ balance encourages you to explore a variety of weapon types. SMGs are considerably less effective, while assault rifles are faster to shoulder and have a reduced impact on speed. A new class of weapons, called marksman rifles, bridges the gap between sniper rifles and assault rifles, providing range and power with greater mobility. Sniper rifles remain largely unaltered with two notable exceptions: new optics that preserve (but blur) your peripheral vision, and aim-assist has been reduced to make obnoxious quick-scoping harder to exploit. The added emphasis on ranged weapons is paired with considerably larger maps, which greatly outnumber those that feature more traditional tight-quarters designs in the 15 included battlefields. In deathmatch-style gametypes, teams will often find themselves spread across smaller contingents at different sides of the map, whereas objective modes will draw everybody to certain points. Instead of just funneling players toward enemies via a limited number of paths, Ghosts presents an array of alternative routes, making team play far more effective than traditional run-and-gun strategy – in fact, running around these large maps gets lonely and boring. Traditional lone wolf-style play also throws a wrench in the spawn system, making enemies often appear nearby without warning. Playing in a well-coordinated group is more gratifying than ever, but more casual solo games can be frustrating. There’s also the much-touted map dynamicism, which disrupts pathways and sightlines using everything from player-triggered gates to a missile strike that turns the environment to a smoldering wasteland. The effect is less impactful and cinematic than Battlefield 4’s crumbling buildings and dams, but with considerably smaller maps and faster-paced gameplay, grander scale or frequency would have been distracting. Instead, the traps and map events are only brief interruptions that can shake things up if one team becomes entrenched, but won’t fundamentally alter the course of a game.  Ghosts multiplayer introduces five brand-new gametypes alongside all of the series staples like Domination and Kill Confirmed, for a total of 13 different modes. Although many of the new modes expand upon existing gametypes, each adds a fresh dynamic. My favorite new addition, Grind, is like Kill Confirmed, except that it requires you to not only collect dog tags from downed enemies, but also deposit them in one of two “banks” on the map before being killed yourself. Another, Cranked, is like Team Deathmatch, but whenever you score a kill, you’re given a 30 seconds to rack up another kill – or else you'll explode. Although they’re simple modifiers, the new gametypes are immensely fun and breathe new life into multiplayer. Extinction, Ghosts’ new alien invasion mode, is better compared to Valve's Left 4 Dead games than Treyarch’s zombie modes from Black Ops. It's a four-player cooperative mode wherein you fight off monstrous creatures through a miniature campaign set in a large, multi-stage level. Unlike zombies, the aliens are nimble and unpredictable, leaping over objects and scaling walls. It's a tough challenge, and teams must carefully consider their loadouts, special abilities, equipment, and power-up trees to ensure survival, making for an interesting strategic dynamic. For a more traditional Call of Duty experience, but sheltered from the fierce competitive landscape of multiplayer, there’s Squads: a suite of cooperative modes that offers wave defense (AKA horde mode) and competitive bot matches. In a cool touch, Squads uses your custom characters and classes as the basis for A.I. soldiers that play alongside you to battle other bots or human players. Bot matches are hardly novel for the genre, but the soldiers in Squads are especially notable because of how easy it is to mistake them for human players due to their use of advanced tactics. It's impressive how they move through maps aggressively, and appear to be acutely aware of other players.  Squads is an excellent testing ground, and offers a nice respite from online multiplayer while also contributing to online character progression using the unified Create a Soldier system. Most importantly, the new Call of Duty profile system allows players to carry over their stats, unlocks, and characters created for Squads or multiplayer across generations. If you play on Xbox 360 and visit a friend who owns a Xbox One, your character and all progression is carried over, and comes back home with you. This is possible, in part, because of cross-generation, cross-platform feature parity. Character customization, maps, dynamic events, weapons, gametypes, and constant 60fps multiplayer framerates are ubiquitous across current- and next-gen platforms. The biggest variations between platforms falls upon visuals and player counts. On the current-gen versions Ghosts looks nearly identical, though I did encounter occasional framerate issues during the single-player campaign on PS3 and PS4, whereas my time with the Xbox One version was stable throughout. Like Black Ops II, the Wii U version takes advantage of the gamepad to present a secondary display for the in-game map and provide touchscreen shortcuts to custom loadouts. The gamepad’s display can also be used to play without a TV, though it also supports Wii Remotes and the controller. Graphically, the Wii U version is comparable to Xbox 360 and PS3, and overall, runs smoothly. Unsurprisingly, the PC version scales well from low- to high-end machines, and in most cases, looks superior to the next-gen experience. It’s difficult to appreciate the variation between current-gen and next-gen in TV commercials or a browser window, but up close and personal, the difference is drastic. Whereas the current-gen versions look muddy with blotchy textures, characters, weapon models, and environments are presented in vivid detail on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. The Call of Duty engine fares surprisingly well on next-gen, but even then Ghosts lacks a lot of the added atmospheric effects and visual panache that makes competing games look so realistic. I’m eager to see what a future Call of Duty looks like when maintaining 60 frames-per-second on current-gen is no longer a concern.  When comparing the PS4 and Xbox One versions side-by-side, there’s little to no variation in textures and effects, but there is a discernible difference in resolution. While both are displayed at 1080p, the Xbox One version upscales the game from 720p resolution. In contrast, the PS4 version runs natively at 1080p, which makes character models, weapons, and environments look noticeably sharper and more detailed. The difference is especially apparent on larger-sized TVs, where pixel density weighs more heavily in picture quality. It’s certainly going to be a sticking point for those who demand the highest fidelity experience, but the difference is harder to identify in absence of a side-by-side comparison. Oddly, the Xbox One version makes no use of the haptic feedback motors built into the controller’s triggers, and the DualShock 4’s trackpad is used solely as a button to toggle the in-game scoreboard during multiplayer. There is, however, one notable exclusion from current-gen. Historically, Call of Duty has limited a majority of its modes to 12 players, but offered an additional playlist that supports 18-player matches known as Ground War. While the larger-scale matches live on with the PS4, Xbox One, and PC, owners of the Xbox 360, Wii U, and PS3 versions are capped at 12 players. It’s a surprising step back for the series, and the larger maps could have benefited from the higher player count. It should also be noted that my smooth multiplayer experience was hosted on a dedicated server hosted by Activision – and most of yours will be, too. Activision says that all platforms will use a hybrid of dedicated servers and peer-to-peer matchmaking, which should eliminate many of the lag issues we've seen in the past. If all goes well, the days of being tossed into a game hosted by someone 2,000 miles away on a dial-up connection will be behind us. Call of Duty: Ghosts isn't a reinvention of the franchise, but proves there's still room for innovation within its existing formula. Though at the risk of overcomplicating things at times, its robust multiplayer gameplay, surprisingly fun co-op modes, and lengthy, challenging, and varied campaign makes Ghosts one of the best Call of Duty games to date.  As of 11/12/13, this review has been updated to reflect impressions of COD: Ghosts on all five platforms. Whew!
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	 Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is a smart, sprawling sequel that wisely places an emphasis on freedom and fun while trimming most of the fat that bogged down Assassin’s Creed III’s ambitious but uneven adventure. Ubisoft’s take on the Golden Age of Piracy begins in 1715, and is presented with a much-appreciated lighter tone that isn’t afraid to make fun of itself in the name of an entertaining journey. Sailing across the massive expanse of The Caribbean, exploring gorgeous and unique islands, and getting yourself into all sorts of swashbuckling trouble provide some of the most rewarding and memorable stretches of gameplay I’ve experienced all year. Even after putting in well over 50 hours with the Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii U, PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4 versions, I’m still discovering new islands to explore and tombs to raid.  No matter which console you decide to play Black Flag on, you can rest easy knowing that it’s one of the best looking games of 2013. The current-gen versions build upon the already-gorgeous AC 3 by showcasing well-lit, tropical locales and the amazing water effects on the open seas. And on next gen, the experience is even more impressive thanks to minimal loading and maximum draw distances that seem to go on for miles. The way the camera zooms out when your ship reaches its maximum speed, the speakers bombard you with the sounds of the wind, and the sunset turns blood-orange, is simply amazing. The PS4 and Xbox One versions are nearly identical, and both deliver the same gorgeous adventure. All versions of the game come with some form of off-screen support. The Wii U GamePad acts as a map that comes in handy when you're searching for a particularly hidden piece of treasure, or you can play Black Flag directly off of the screen on your controller. The other versions support Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed IV Companion App, a free download that lets you turn any tablet into a home for maps, an Animus database, and much more. There's a lot of information to digest in Black Flag, and being able to utilize a second screen instead of constantly bouncing in and out of menus helps keep you in the experience. Black Flag learns from AC 3’s initial 10 hours of banal hand-holding by immediately throwing you into the action. After a lean and exhilarating opening mission that places you in the blood-soaked boots of Connor’s much livelier and more likeable grandfather Edward Kenway, the world blossoms and allows you to explore its vast uncharted waters. The size of the world is staggering, and the fact that it's absolutely brimming with fun and rewarding activities made me want to get lost as possible as I traveled from point A to point B. When you ignore the main mission prompt and simply set out in search of your own fun, Black Flag is at its best. It treats you like an adult, and allows you to explore its gorgeous and activity-filled world to your heart’s content. Want to discover every nook and cranny of Kingston’s sprawling expanse in search of Templar secrets? Or would you rather buy a small fishing boat and hunt for all manner of deadly sea creatures, using your spoils to upgrade your character? Maybe you just want to sail to a remote island, climb to the top of a mountain, and gaze in awe at the world around you. Black Flag is all about embracing freedom and carving your own path through the world.  The freedom to tell your own stories also exists in the multiplayer mode, which, once again, refines the unique cat-and-mouse gameplay originally introduced in Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood. Having to blend into your surroundings and try to trick other players into thinking you're an A.I.-controlled NPC provides ample moments of tense and entertaining mayhem. Just like previous versions, it’s a welcome alternative to the standard deathmatch that's become the norm in most multiplayer games, but it’s not substantial enough to be the main reason to keep coming back to Black Flag. Also back and better than ever is the series' signature feeling of momentum. It does a great job of marrying the vertical city-based traversal of Assassin’s Creed II with the energetic frontier movement of AC 3. That being said, Edward still occasionally disobeyed my commands by errantly jumping off rooftops and climbing up walls that I never wanted to scale in the first place, but those are minor nuisances. Also, the world’s vast scope invites a handful of hiccups. For instance, the body of a guard who’s holding a necessary key might disappear if you leave the area, meaning that you have to restart a mission. Black Flag is peppered with these sorts of annoyances, and though they certainly aren't deal-breakers, they had a tendency to pull me out of the experience a bit too often. Ubisoft wisely avoids the morose spaghetti bowl that Assassin’s Creed’s plot lines have become in favor of a much lighter tale that embraces the adventuresome spirit of classic pirate stories. I loved the fact that Edward is so unlike his Assassin relatives, and much more interested in the pursuit of money than the opaque goals of some secret cabal. It's a refreshing change of pace from a series that had started to take itself a bit too seriously.  This lighter tone is also evident in the way that Black Flag feels less violent than its predecessors. Death animations are relatively short and sweet, with a surprising lack of blood for a game centered around stabbing people. The restraint is admirable, and it makes combat more fun and less serious business slaughter than in recent years. Then again, Black Flag also tends to repeat some of the Assassin's Creed series’ favorite mistakes, like forcing you to tail a prospective victim at a safe distance for minutes on end while you’re given an exposition dump. It’s mighty annoying that I had to spend 10 minutes listening to rarely memorable dialogue before I could make the kill. While the main story is a bit of letdown, I was honestly shocked at how much I enjoyed my time spent outside of the Animus. These first-person missions are mostly optional, but surprisingly great. As a new Abstergo employee working to develop an entertainment product based on Edward’s life, you’ll quickly find yourself embroiled in a bit of corporate espionage that ultimately leads to you to discover all sorts of secrets that gleefully hint at the future of the series. The amazing world of Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag has kept me gladly occupied for longer than any other game in the series, even though its story isn’t the strongest. At no point in my dozens of hours was I ever at a loss for something to do. Simply sailing wherever the wind takes me and seeing what sort of trouble I can get into is a complete joy. Beyond the underwhelming main campaign, Black Flag delivers a world brimming with gorgeous places to go, amazing secrets to discover, and nefarious pirates to stab.
Steve Butts	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/22/lego-marvel-super-heroes-review	" The best thing about LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is that it delivers almost everything a Marvel fan could want. From Abomination to the Wizard, this game is an A-to-Z (well, A-to-W) love letter to the Marvel Universe that starts with the Silver Surfer gliding across the title screen and ends with a credits song that could not have been better chosen. A few technical glitches and some carryovers from the franchise history keep it from being an outright masterpiece, but it easily ranks as one of the best superhero games I've played in years. It starts with the characters. Where LEGO Batman 2 offers a sizable roster of heroes and villains, the campaign in LEGO Marvel delivers more playable heroes in a much more coherent story about collecting cosmic bricks around the world before villains do. The first mission starts with Iron Man and Hulk, but the selection of playable characters soon grows to include the rest of the Avengers, the Fantastic Four, loads of X-Men, and even Spider-Man. You'll even switch heroes mid-way through many of the missions, with Cyclops and Jean Grey rescuing Storm and Iceman during an assault on the X-Mansion, or the Human Torch flying in to assist Black Widow and Hawkeye as they infiltrate a Hydra base. The entrances and exits are all handled as part of the story, which gives you a chance to play several characters who all feel like they're part of a single narrative.  The same is true of the villains. You can start by chasing Doctor Octopus from the Baxter Building to the Daily Bugle, but you'll soon be flying off to thwart Dr. Doom's plans in Latveria and taking the Rainbow Bridge to stop Loki from stirring up the frost giants in Asgard. I particularly liked how each mission played out as a sort of protracted chase, with the heroes in pursuit of folks like Magneto or the Red Skull, while battling lots of lesser villains like Pyro or the Leader along the way. As great as it all is, telling such an earth-shattering story without major characters like Dr. Strange or Sub-Mariner present feels off. Still, when a game features lesser-known characters like Black Bolt, Captain Britain and HERBIE, it's hard to complain. Maybe they're saving Kang and Ultron for a sequel? The puzzles in the LEGO games are almost always solved by matching the right power to the right problem, and the Marvel take on this mechanic is particularly inventive. Take Black Widow for example. She, like Invisible Woman, can spoof security cameras, but Widow also has the acrobatic skill of Captain America, which enables her to access remote areas of the levels, and the brains of Tony Stark, which lets her use certain consoles that would be off limits to other heroes. Throw in a gun, and you've got a very useful character made up of a number of different power sets. Storm and Thor, for instance, can both use electricity to power up stations, but Thor can smash open walls while Storm can put out fires. Even though there are only maybe a couple dozen powers to share among them all, the various combinations of powers ensures that no one feels entirely redundant. You will get a few power sets that seem a bit out of place; Captain America's ubiquitous shield switches seem a little arbitrary, as does the notion that Wolverine should be really good at digging and climbing. There are also a few that make sense but aren't particularly well implemented. The special sixth sense shared by characters like Spider-Man, Wolverine, and Daredevil is really more for recognizing what walls you can climb than for keeping those characters out of danger.   I finished the main campaign in under 12 hours, but I've been coming back to collect extra characters and bricks for days after. In between missions, there's a massive open-world map of Manhattan to explore, from the Statue of Liberty and Battery Park to the X-Mansion up past Harlem. There's also the massive SHIELD Helicarrier floating over the East River. The city has loads of attractions, complete with characters to collect and challenges to beat. Over the course of the side missions, you'll help Heimdall take out frost giants on the docks, battle Sentinels in the streets, or take control of a neglectful boyfriend's mind and make him climb the Empire State Building to apologize to his girlfriend. Experienced gamers won't find many of the open-world puzzles and challenges to be much of a contest; for the most part, you'll simply need to identify the type of task you're facing and then just go hit the right steps in the right order. It's clear that the challenges are aimed at LEGO’s young demographic, so gamers craving a challenge will be let down here. Still, if the allure of putting Daredevil on a motorcycle and having him race Ghost Rider through the Upper West Side sounds fun, the difficulty is sort of incidental. The rare exceptions are the timed challenges, or those that require you to search out objectives that aren't in the immediate vicinity of the challenge. The biggest pain is the inconsistent, confusing flight system. It attempts to use the same control scheme from the missions where the up and down motion of the thumbstick moves your character toward or away from the camera. Now you'll use face buttons to control the pitch of your character's flight. The problem is that the button you use to ascend is also the button you use to accelerate, and I frequently found myself flying into the side of buildings or massively overshooting my objective. Even with a week or so of playing, it still seems weird to me.  Even with that one chief complaint, there's just so much to love about LEGO Marvel that I've been playing it a few hours a day for over a week now and am still finding new charms. From unlocking Gwen Stacy and making her jump off the Brooklyn Bridge to watching the heroes dance at Tony Stark's house parties, this game is full of the moments that make Marvel one of the best brands in entertainment.  LEGO Marvel Super Heroes is the best thing to happen to Marvel games since 2006's Marvel Ultimate Alliance. It's a warm and witty, multi-layered approach to the brand that ties in hundreds of Marvel's most iconic characters, settings, and stories. While you can knock out the campaign story in around eight hours, the world is rich with content, and I've found myself up late every night for the past week playing for ""just one more hour."" It may not offer the challenge or player-driven context of this year's other open-world games, but those games would be hard-pressed to deliver as much fun and happiness as you'll find in Traveler's Tales latest. 'Nuff said."
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/26/rayman-legends-review	 The most remarkable thing about Rayman Legends is how consistently it introduces new and unpredictable ideas over its roughly 12 hours. This beautifully animated co-op game tosses dozens of inventive ideas into the mix, proving there's still room for exciting creativity in the platforming genre. Naturally, Rayman starts out with simple running, jumping, and punching, but before you know it you’re sneaking past dozens of deadly traps, battling huge bosses, or playing through awesome challenge levels that look like '90s music videos. Every time I thought I found a personal favorite stage, the next one came along and replaced it.  I kept thinking the constant variety couldn't possibly hold up, but surprisingly, each of Rayman Legends’ stages looks more impressive than the last. This sequel takes Rayman Origins' colorful, animated look and feel in new directions. The beautiful transitions and clever bosses look stunning, expressive, and vibrant. A distinctly Loony Toons quality of the music and the adorable alien Teensies Rayman has to rescue give Legends character and personality to spare, even though there’s not much story here. I love its subtle and inventive visual tricks that hide dozens of crafty secret areas in plain sight, and since most levels don’t have time constraints, Legends gives us carte blanche to roam around to discover and appreciate secrets for ourselves. Compared to most platformer characters, Rayman's jump physics tend to feel a little floaty, but I got used to it and grew to love it quickly. The levels he runs through never feel frustrating thanks to some great pacing, and the variety of stealth puzzle areas, standard platformer challenges, and shoot-'em-up-inspired gliding stages constantly kept me on my toes and eager to see what came next. No matter what the challenge, they’re all brilliantly designed, and there’s an incredible feeling of satisfaction that comes from clearing each stage. Boss fights are some of the highlights of Rayman Legends. They don't reinvent the platforming boss battle, but these encounters show off some of the best visuals tricks, putting on a spectacular show. The Luchador, for example, is a towering mass of muscle who swings a huge hand and constantly launches his tiny opponents into the air. As I figured out his patterns and thumped him on the head, the reactions from the surrounding crowd sold the atmosphere of a big prizefight. Amazing games like this one are always best when shared with friends or family, and almost every level feels finely tuned for both single-player and co-op. Things do get a bit chaotic when four players are jumping around at once – it’s easy to get confused about which character is yours, since everyone shares the same screen and a lot of the character skins look similar. To be fair though, no platformer has really solved this problem yet, and Rayman does it as well as any. The one thing that's truly disappointing is that there’s no online play, which means that other than some online leaderboards and daily challenges, Rayman Legends is stranded as a couch co-op game. The PS3 and Xbox 360 versions of Rayman Legends support co-op for four players, and the Wii U version adds in one more using the GamePad. It’s no secret that Rayman Legends was planned as a Wii U exclusive, and the Wii U GamePad works well with it to let one player take on an assistant role and help out the other four by activating switches in the environment. But Ubisoft came up with an elegant solution when it transitioned Legends to other platforms by letting Rayman command his flying encyclopedia assistant activate switches and levers using a single button.  On PS3 and 360, these puzzles require precise timing which makes it more difficult played in single-player, but I still found that to be a good challenge; it provides another interesting twist that gave me a fun level of control over the environment. It’s great that Ubisoft figured out how to make this co-op idea work in single-player, and that the frequent and well-placed checkpoints make sure it never feels frustrating. On Wii U, this setup is a little different: If you're playing single-player, at one point you switch to the perspective of the assistant, and gameplay moves to the GamePad screen in a hilarious transition. At that point, Legends takes advantage of the Wii U's hardware to have you play a minigame in which you pull switches to manipulate the environment to try to keep a computer-controlled Sir Globrax alive in labyrinth-like stages.  The PS4, Xbox One, and PC versions of Rayman Legends look the same as the rest, except at a higher resolution. But I didn't feel like this made a big difference in the visual quality, because Rayman's strength is in its arts style rather than its technology. The only benefit here is reduced load times that quickly allow you to zip into a level of choice. The PS4 version has one additional feature: You can take screenshots and then pan and zoom using the Dual Shock 4's touch pad. It's a good idea that's a lot of fun in co-op, requiring careful teamwork and coordination, but in single-player it's the most frustrating part of Rayman Legends. Simply put, they transform it from a great platformer into a frustrating escort mission. No matter how carefully I would clear a path for Sir Globrax, he still doesn’t always make good decisions. Sometimes he understands the trail you’re trying to set for him, and even occasionally shows some level of desire for self-preservation, but often he’ll go straight into a dangerous obstacle he could have avoided. Again, they're great when played in co-op, but constantly losing because of AI stupidity beyond my control made me want to avoid those missions entirely in single-player. No matter where I play it, though, Rayman Legends is a fantastic example of why platformers will never stop being fun. It got where it is by building on lessons that trace back to classic Nintendo-made platformers, such as Yoshi’s Island and Wario Land 4. Both games buck traditional genre trends and focused on exploration and discovery, and Rayman Legends takes the same approach and adds a consistent formula of smoothly increasing challenge, colorful presentation, and crazy variety that reminds me why I fell in love with this genre in the first place. Rayman Legends is a delightful platformer, and one of the best I’ve ever played. Thanks to clever level design that toys with genre conventions, it gets incredible mileage out of four basic moves. And with great local co-op and dozens of unlockables – including stages from Rayman Origins, special character skins, and mini-games – there’s a lot to do. The difficulty is so smoothly balanced that it can be played with with kids or adult friends and still have a great time.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	" One of the most rewarding moments of Gone Home, and any work of fiction for that matter, is when you take a jumbled mess of oddly shaped metaphorical puzzle pieces and finally put them together to resemble something familiar. This revelation sprang forth for me a few hours into my first-person walkabout through the Greenbriar household. As I rummaged through an abandoned kitchen examining refrigerator notes, discarded paperback books, and surprisingly named bottles of salad dressing, the proverbial light bulb suddenly illuminated. Yes, I was exploring the Greenbriar home, a digital space where the first game by The Fullbright Company is set. But perhaps more importantly, I was exploring something strikingly similar to the house I grew up in. Each time I clicked on an item owned by a family member and studied its various traits, like empty liquor bottles belonging to a father who may or may not drink too much, or a sarcastically written term-paper on the female reproductive system that highlights a young woman's sharp wit, I was brought back to the uncountable innocuous nick-nacks that populate my parent's house.   Throughout Gone Home, a first-person exploratory adventure game, you'll poke around a beautifully created house and examine the artifacts that populate each well-designed room, and everywhere you look the house has a warm, lived-in feel. The family's study is filled with interesting books to browse, records to listen to, and liquor cabinets to raid. The kitchen is as wonderfully disorganized as my mom's, and the bedroom of an angsty teenager feels like the bedroom of an angsty teenager. It oftentimes felt as if I had broken into a museum in the middle of the night with the goal of touching the very things that I was told not to touch. Games like The Last of Us and BioShock Infinite allow us to explore exceptionally realized worlds, but Gone Home's world just feels straight-up real. Despite an ever-present sense of dread – lights flicker sporadically, a fierce thunderstorm rages outside, and the house itself seems to moan at times – there's nothing to fear in Gone Home. The only skeletons here are figurative, which you'll eventually discover as you explore the house and begin to unravel the family's past. As you delve deeper into the Greenbriar residence, you'll come across telephone messages, scrawled notes, and diary entries that provide the clues needed for you to begin illuminating the dark corners of this family. The writing and voice work here are among the best I've ever experienced in games. It's not stylish or exaggerated, but rather painfully real. Unraveling the story of your character’s teenage sister Samantha's coming of age, the complicated intricacies of your parent's marriage, and eventually the reasons why you left home in the first place make Gone Home a powerful piece of storytelling. I'm being a bit vague for a reason, because so much of the emotional impact I felt stemmed from discovering these bits of backstory and piecing them together myself. The writing and artifact design are so good that I felt compelled to grab everything that wasn't bolted to the floor and give it a closer examination. Turning around a can of soup reveals a fully written label. Thumbing through a VHS collection highlights a wealth of classics from Gone Home's mid-'90s setting. And entering a closet only to find it filled to the brim with board games, subtly weathered with use, all contribute toward making the Greenbriar household feel like a living, breathing place.   Doing this isn't just some menial task – scouring the house with a fine-toothed comb leads to optional story revelations, humorous asides, and sometimes both. For example, while rummaging through my father's study, I came across a box filled to the brim with dozens of copies of his unsuccessful second novel. But after removing the top few layers of literature, I unearthed he awful Pandora's Box of his smut magazine collection. This moment walked such a fine line between painful and comical, and it's only one of many that did so throughout my three hours in the house. The only drawback to the inanimate objects that lay about the Greenbriar home is that by the end, you're sometimes examining a handful of the same things. Coming across the same box of tissues in every other room pulled me out of the world just a tad bit – like a deja vu glitch in the Matrix. Also, the first time I held my father's sophomore novel, I was completely enthralled with studying its cover. The second time, it made sense since that book was a commercial failure, and unsold copies would litter this house. The fifth time: not so much. But despite this infrequent repetition, Gone Home continually won me over in spades partially due to its impeccable use of music. A successful mix of a moody, ambient score and a variety of cult Riot Grrrl hits (played by sticking various cassette tapes found scattered throughout the house into a tape player) create an affecting ambiance. The two styles might seem to clash in stark juxtaposition on paper, but they somehow managed to meld together to give Gone Home a musical backbone that's riddled with both teenage angst as well as an air of mystery. When Thomas Wolfe wrote ""You Can't Go Home Again,"" the mere idea of Pong would've wrecked his fragile mind. But nearly a century later, Gone Home presents us with a game that both embraces that melancholic notion while simultaneously exploring the roots, secrets, and artifacts of a family that feels as real to me as my own. Stepping foot inside of the Greenbriar home and discovering the things they left behind is a powerful experience. Gone Home is a remarkable achievement, and piecing together its poignant story will stick with me forever."
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	" [Note: Final review posted February 2, 2015] It may be squalid and zombie-infested, but Dying Light's city of Harran isn't a depressing wasteland – it's a vibrant, ambitious, open-world playground. Here, buildings are for climbing, the undead are there to be destroyed in creative ways, and there's always something interesting to be discovered nearby. It takes a while for that to become clear, though; at first, you might even think Dying Light is really about running scared from mobs of seemingly unconquerable zombies, who can quickly drain your stamina and wear out your improvised weapons. Don't be fooled. Yes, it's a struggle to survive in Dying Light's early hours. Combat is initially clumsy, with the diverse and deadly zombies able to soak up a disturbing amount of punishment before they die for good. Jumping – which is unintuitively mapped to shoulder buttons on consoles – can take a while to get used to. Getting mobbed is usually a death sentence. So is attracting the attention of the much more dangerous things that come out when daytime dynamically gives way to night, at which point the focus shifts to tense stealth — or, if you’re discovered, an adrenaline-pumping sprint for the nearest safe point. Before long, though, you'll build up a skill set that turns your rotting foes into objects of fun, letting you vault across their shoulders, quickly slice them apart with dramatic slow-motion kills, or trick them into gathering around explosives before blasting them all into the sky. Even nighttime becomes an opportunity to raise skills faster thanks to increased XP gain, rather than a period of sheer terror. It all feels great, too; once you adjust to the controls, Dying Light's first-person parkour becomes natural and fluid, and weaving high-speed paths through its decaying slums and picturesque old-world buildings is so much fun that I almost don't hate the lack of a fast-travel option. Combat, meanwhile, gets increasingly satisfying, although it never quite loses its awkwardness. Even when expertly shredding zombies with elementally charged tools of death I built myself, strikes are still heavy and clumsy. And while the guns you'll find later can pop heads from a distance, their low rate of fire and zombie-attracting noise makes them more of an occasional quick fix than a game-changing weapon. To Dying Light's credit, though, your adversaries are surprisingly capable; while the rank-and-file Biters are dumb and fun to manipulate, more powerful enemies – like the quick, agile Virals – are formidable close-quarters opponents, ducking your strikes and sidestepping out of your reach while looking for an opening to attack. Hostile bandits are even deadlier, able to dodge and block at close quarters, throw knives from a distance, and use guns and group tactics to kill you if you get overconfident.  That Dying Light's world is so entertaining is important, because it's unexpectedly huge. Finishing the campaign took me more than 34 hours, with a 68 percent completion rate. The story is serviceable enough, focusing on an undercover agent who becomes a savior to infected survivors and a thorn in the side of a maniacal warlord, but the most surprising thing about it might be its lack of surprises. Similar games have primed me to expect shocks and betrayals that will yank the metaphorical rug out from beneath me, and yet apart from a few big twists early on, Dying Light plays it mostly straight, with little nuance and few hidden agendas from its interesting (but underdeveloped) characters and entertainingly cliché villains. In a way it's almost refreshing, even if the end result is nothing special. A big chunk of my time, though, was spent on detours into side quests, which are where the storytelling really shines. Taking on one of the many requests from random survivors might lead to something ordinary, like a fetch quest – but more often than not, they're multi-part adventures with their own short storylines, which frequently start out as seemingly run-of-the-mill tasks and escalate into something much more lurid and creepy. A search for a missing person, for example, might turn into a hunt for progressively more unsettling clues in a seemingly abandoned apartment building, and a routine rescue mission might turn out to be a trap set by a conniving madman. These are some of Dying Light's most memorable moments, and they make exploring its world even more rewarding. While it's entirely playable as a single-player game, Dying Light is – like most things – better with friends along. Up to three co-op partners can jump in at any time to help you carve up undead hordes, watch your back while you're picking locks, or pursue campaign missions, and while the online matchmaking is still fairly hit-or-miss on PS4, online sessions are smooth and stable once they get going.  It's also useful to have friends around if your game is invaded through the ""Be the Zombie"" mode, which lets a random player jump into your world as a super-powered monster with zipline tendrils and zombie-summoning spit. Playing as said monster is hugely enjoyable, especially after you’ve unlocked some of its grosser attacks, but it feels one-sided unless you're going up against at least two human players.   Other than moderately better visuals, the PC version's biggest leg up on its console counterparts is its customizable keyboard-and-mouse controls. Keeping track of the assorted key functions can be a little trying when things get frantic, but using the space bar to jump still feels more immediately natural than R1 or RB on PS4 or Xbox One. (Gamepads are, of course, supported.) Early on, there were reports that Dying Light would hang before dialogue or cutscenes, but these issues appear to have been patched, and the PC version now mostly runs smoothly for us, with only rare hitching while areas load. There is, however, an occasional issue with some textures popping in at low resolution and sticking that way. The PS4 version has a similar problem, but while it quickly corrects itself, textures that show up blurry on PC tend to stay that way.  Beginning as a furtive, desperate survival-horror experience, Dying Light gradually and gratifyingly evolves into a fast, hyper-violent celebration of vertical freedom and zombie destruction. Its main story is unspectacular, but the memorable side quests and sheer fun of exploring its world do a fantastic job of offsetting that, making Dying Light one of the most engrossing open-world games – zombie-infested or otherwise – I've played in a while."
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	" The Hitman series always seems at its best immersed in the glamour of glitzy private parties, opulent buildings, or bustling public spaces. Hitman Episode 5: Colorado features none of the above; instead it’s set on a run-down, walled-off, and heavily guarded militia base in the muddy American countryside. The result is a satisfying enough change of pace (it’s a very different experience to the levels released to date) albeit one that seems at times it’d be a little more comfortable with Tom Clancy’s name added to the title.   Unlike the previous four missions the Colorado compound is entirely hostile and, save for a small posse of easily frightened computer hackers tucked away inside the main farmhouse, every NPC is armed (even the chef has an assault rifle slung over his shoulder as he slaves away over his stove). The only way to walk around in the open is in disguise; there’s no hiding in plain sight amongst civilians because there aren’t any. If you don’t want to rely on disguises pure stealth is the only other way. Combined with the fact there are four targets plus an additional objective, this is really the trickiest mission so far (and with so much slaying to schedule it’s also quite lengthy). Colorado leverages most of what the previous levels have taught us, so if your skills aren’t up to snuff you may want to bone up on your sneaking and distraction techniques.  Colorado leverages most of what the previous levels have taught us. My chief gripe is that this episode’s ‘Military Shooter 101’ farm map of muted browns and grimy greys is definitely the least interesting environment to date. Compared to previous levels – particularly Sapienza and Paris – Colorado is a lot less engaging. The established Hitman tropes and creative traps are all present and accounted for but – aesthetically speaking, at least – this domestic terrorist training camp looks more like something plucked from a Splinter Cell game or any number of other military-themed also-rans. Taken as a pivot from the previous missions it’s a decent enough diversion, and there are a few noteworthy moments like posing as a scarecrow, or mincing bodies in a hay baler. But stacked up against the most memorable missions the Hitman series has had to offer, Colorado is pretty forgettable. ""Hay! No more scarecrow puns, thanks. This is the last straw."" Pleasantly, I did find it isn’t quite as small as it first seemed, particularly once I began to really explore the sheds, orchard, and various other outbuildings. It is, however, all a bit gloomy and samey. Where previous levels have featured several zones within each that are quite distinct from one another, this Colorado farm is very homogeneous; no one part feels markedly different from the next. It also seems a bit less refined than the other missions so far. For instance, I noted when guards went into an alert state many elect to take up positions at the entrances to the orchard but, because they all root themselves in exactly the same spot, I ended up watching as multiple guards stood clipping through each other like a quartet of armed ghosts all standing on the same doormat. It is worth noting that, for the first time, the English voice acting here in Colorado doesn’t feel incompatible with the setting. Colorado, then, is the first time I’ve found myself able to appreciate the nuance of their conversations (the way NPCs react to your actions and communicate your description to other NPCs is impressive) rather than cringe at the horribly incongruous accents. Unfortunately the next and final level for this season, Tokyo, will probably be a different story. Developer IO also continues to tug on the season’s connecting plot thread in Colorado but I’m still finding it impossible to get invested in a tale told in two minute bursts, six or so weeks apart. With no civilian aspect to the map at all, Hitman Episode 5: Colorado is a shift in gear from the previous four missions that’s both refreshing and a disappointment. In a way it’s a nice change-up to the established formula to date but the drab and gloomy farm isn’t an especially memorable environment. It is, however, the trickiest series of hits this season thanks to a big push for stealth, and probably the lengthiest episode so far."
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	 Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle is an unanticipated game that’s full of surprises. Its XCOM-style, turn-based tactics gameplay is just about the last thing I’d have expected from either Mario or Rabbids, but its absurdist charm works against the odds and it’s far more difficult and meatier than you probably think. When you break it down, a lot of the challenge comes down to pure trial and error, but the moment of figuring out its tactical puzzles and chaining together a string of attacks delivers a strong shot of satisfaction. The bizarre story that brings Ubisoft’s Rabbids into the Mushroom Kingdom of Nintendo’s Mario and literally mashes them together embraces the fact that it’s complete nonsense on every level and just rolls with it. I couldn’t help but think of the plot of The Fly as a sci-fi gadget merged unwitting denizens of Mario’s universe with an unintentional interdimensional invasion of idiot rabbit-things. There are some decent jokes that arise from the slurry, including at least one Game of Thrones reference, and a lot is owed to the Rabbids’ almost entirely physical comedy. I don’t understand why the eight-character roster includes both normal and only vaguely related Rabbid-ized versions of Mario, Luigi, Peach, and Yoshi, but I accepted it because of the humor. That said, I don’t think I’ll ever be totally okay with seeing those characters shoot enemies with guns (ranging from a knockoff of Mega Man’s arm cannon to straight-up shotguns and Gattling guns) when I’m accustomed to seeing them shoot fireballs from white-gloved hands, but other than that it’s the good kind of dumb fun.  Mario + Rabbids obviously borrows liberally from the turn-based tactics genre’s current most prominent series, XCOM, most notably in its use of full and half-shield icons to represent full and half cover. But this style of turn-based tactics is vastly different. (Trust me: I went directly from XCOM 2: War of the Chosen to this, and it was quite a shock to the system – in a good, refreshing sort of way.) The way your three-person team works together, bouncing off each other and using complementary special abilities to maximize movement and damage, is a distinctive idea that forces an extremely aggressive playstyle and incentivizes keeping your team mostly together to make the most of their unique abilities.  Attention to detail in animation constantly impressed me. While it’s a simpler setup than XCOM due to its more compressed maps and smaller squads, every team member gets to take more actions per turn, which amplifies possibilities. In just one move, a fully upgraded character like Rabbid Peach can dash-attack up to four enemies, leap off a teammate to extend her range, fire her laser pistol or launch a remote-control car bomb, and either cast a damage-dampening force field around herself or heal any teammates in range. Mario, meanwhile, can only dash-attack two enemies, but can bounce off an ally and land on an enemy for a signature stomp attack, then either fire his pistol or bash the heck out of the surrounding area with a giant hammer, and finally either activate a two-shot reaction fire mode or buff the damage of anyone around him. It’s a lot of fun to watch one of those strings in action, thanks in no small part to the excellent animations of everything from the hero-pose landings after a big jump, to enemies hitting the deck when you take a shot at someone behind them, to Rabbid Peach leaning up against a slab of rock you placed her next to for half-cover. Attention to detail there constantly impressed me, right down to the quiver of Mario’s ‘stache. On the other hand, all of that movement can make turns feel chaotic and confusing – especially in the early levels – because both your squad and the enemies on the board are so mobile that it’s tough to understand what you’re capable of or predict what they’ll do. Many maps have the signature Mario pipes (though now they’re white and have rabbit ears and tongues) which can warp you to higher elevations or across the map, or both, and using what’s there is essential to understanding what the map designers had in mind for us. Generally, you have to assume that if an enemy is anywhere near you, he can probably outflank you, and there are annoyingly few ways to stop them. Even with reaction-fire ability from Mario, Luigi, Peach, or Yoshi has only a 30% chance of stopping most enemies in their tracks (if it triggers an effect like fire, push, or blinding ink), and those have long cooldown timers to ensure you can only use them a couple of times in a typical level. So it’s kill or be killed – and there are virtually always more of them than there are of you.  There are a ton of good combinations to work with within the eight-character roster, though the mix-and-match opportunities are hamstrung by a couple of arbitrary-feeling restrictions: Mario must be the leader of every party (fair enough, his name’s on the box after all) and you must have at least one Rabbid character. That last one was a roadblock for a lot of my best ideas, which probably means it’s there to prevent unbalanced things like having three characters taking turns going on reaction fire and ensuring that no enemy movement goes unpunished during an ability’s cooldown phase.  Mario + Rabbids is viciously tough - and it knows it. Which brings us to the biggest surprise of Mario + Rabbids: how viciously tough it is. Granted, most fights took me five or 10 minutes to get a “perfect” score by finishing within the turn timer limit with all three teammates alive. But every so often there was one that took an hour or more of trial-and-error attempts, testing out different combinations of the eight characters and slightly different approaches to the problem. Mario + Rabbids doesn’t have “save-scuming” – not exactly, anyway. (That’s where you quicksave before going into a fight and reload when the battle plan fails to survive contact with the enemy.) When something goes wrong and your Rabbid Luigi gets slammed unconscious by a hulking enemy carrying a giant slab of ice as a bludgeon, or you forget that you can’t fire through a Breacher’s front-facing shield, or you simply accidentally push A when the cursor was one square off from where you thought it was and now you’ve left your Yoshi exposed, that’s often effectively a game-over and you have to restart the entire match. Most of them are short enough (three or four turns) that it doesn’t sting much, but a few are multi-stage battles where hitting the restart button means you’re in for the chore of going through the motions of a puzzle you’re already figured out. In XCOM you have the option to continue after a loss, but here you have to keep beating your head against a wall until you overcome each challenge, and that can get tedious.  Some of the difficulty spikes are really nasty, and Mario + Rabbids knows it. You can tell because at the start of every fight you’re asked if you want to play in Easy Mode, which gives you extra health. But even with that boost I wouldn’t call some of these “easy,” because if you’re getting slammed hard you’re probably not going to be saved by a few more hitpoints. You really have to understand how the mechanics work to win, which is a good thing unless you’re just learning the ropes. It makes me wonder why Ubisoft didn’t set up a “normal” mode between “easy” and “hard,” thus letting more people have a good time on their first attempt and avoiding the appearance of passive-aggression in offering a crutch for the poor baby gamer who can’t keep up.  There's a very respectable amount of enemy variety. Merging the intentionally obnoxious Rabbids with Mario mainstays like Boos and Piranha Plants produces lots of weird combinations, and that gives Mario + Rabbids a very respectable amount of enemy variety. There are the already-mentioned shield guys and bludgeoning guys (who advance toward you every time you shoot them), Centurions who can shield allies and fire machine guns out of their nipples (I wish I were making that up) and spectral enemies who can teleport long distances and then shoot you in the back from afar, whom I hate. There are bomb-throwers and shielded cactus guys. And then there are the bosses. Mario + Rabbids does a very good job of making its boss fights stand out. Whether you’re fighting a giant Rabbid Kong who scarfs bananas to restore his health or a Phantom of the Opera parody who sings a hell of a song while you knock out the spotlights that sustain his ego, it never fails to make these battles feel distinct and interesting. You also go up against minibosses (or “midbosses,” as it insists on calling them) which tend to be much harder than the boss fights themselves but generally equal in goofiness. There are also several levels that have a strong gimmick, like the Chain Chomp who attacks whatever’s nearest to it or fireballs falling from the sky in pre-designated locations. I wish there were more of these toward the end of the campaign, but overall it does a good job of mixing these special conditions with the normal ones like kill everything, get at least one of your team to a goal zone, and escorting an unarmed VIP through a gauntlet. Between fights, Mario + Rabbids throws some mostly simple puzzles in our path to cleanse the palette. There’s a lot of pushing blocks onto pressure pads and pushing buttons to adjust color-coded platforms – stuff I associate more with Zelda than Mario – and tiny obstacle courses where you’re collecting coins as quickly as you can. For the latter type, where timing and accuracy matters, Mario + Rabbids has oddly tripped itself up by making the leader of your party on the real-time map a new character named Beep-0, who’s basically a Roomba that’s become a real boy. I have no real problem with Beep-0 as a character, and I kind of enjoy wondering how his bleeped-out dialogue text made it past Nintendo, but as a party leader he’s terrible.  30 years of gaming history has taught me that I should focus on Mario. The past 30 years of gaming history has taught me that I should focus on Mario whenever he’s on screen, but here he’s always second in line in the train of four characters to Beep-0, of all people. When you’re running away from the camera, you can barely see Beep-0 at all. So I found myself constantly turning too early because I thought I was the second person in a train instead of the first, and that made control feel imprecise. A few timed puzzles were harder than they should’ve been as a result. Also, there are a ton of them, but only one in four or five offers any sort of in-game upgrade (as opposed to a new piece of concept art or music), which is disappointing after I spend time solving a puzzle. Another stumble is the progression system, which doesn’t make a lot of sense. On the surface it’s fairly standard: every time you level up, you have to spend money to upgrade your squad’s weaponry to the next tier. When you inevitably run out of cash to upgrade weapons (which you almost certainly will) and want to change up your party to counter a new enemy, like when you realize you need Rabbid Luigi’s Vampire-effect slide attacks more than regular Luigi’s sniper rifle (Luigi’s a sniper now, FYI) you have to revisit a previous fight to earn more. That’d be a very traditional sort of grindiness – also objectionable in its own way – except that here you play the old levels with your leveled-up characters, which makes them so easy they’re a waste of time and the money basically free.  Mario + Rabbids also comes with a few co-op levels that are unlocked as you finish each of the visually diverse worlds, though the concept of local co-op is a little silly in a turn-based tactics game because it’s no different from passing the controller back and forth between two people. Those levels do give you four characters instead of three, though, which opens up the tactics a little – but it just makes me wish I could’ve done that in the campaign in single-player. If you don’t want to wait for someone else to play with you can always play both sides yourself, holding one Joy-Con at a time like a sad person. Which I have done. All told, there are at least 20 hours of content here – and that’s if you’re not new to this genre. That’s good because I can’t see a lot of replay value in going back to do it again other than to try the same scenarios with less appropriate teams. The only random factors here are whether or not you hit the coin-flip shots at enemies in low cover. To be fair, that can absolutely make the difference between a win and a loss, but since Mario + Rabbids gives you no choice but to reload when you lose, it doesn’t have quite the same drama as in a game with permanent death. Based on its colorful world, beautiful animation, and source material you might expect Mario + Rabbids: Kingdom Battle to be “My first turn-based tactics game.” But you’re in for a surprise: even for XCOM vets some of its battles are challenging puzzles. Some of its tougher levels do devolve into a trial-and-error slog, but a good mix of enemies, objectives, and character abilities keep things interesting.
Tom Marks	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/31/overcooked-special-edition-review	 A well played round of Overcooked feels like dancing in a graceful ballet, except missing a step means your burger burns, the kitchen lights on fire, and a raccoon in a wheelchair plummets into a lake of lava. Actually, maybe it’s nothing like a ballet (although this gives me an idea for a fantastic ballet). But working with your teammates as a well-oiled machine to produce food for an insatiable demon is as rewarding as it is challenging. Overcooked remains one of the most fun couch co-op games I’ve played in years, despite some port problems that keep the Special Edition on the Switch from standing as the definitive version. The local co-op cook-em-up poses the herculean challenge of asking up to four people to work together for three full minutes at a time, performing relatively simple cooking-related actions to fill food orders. It’s practically a two-button game: one to pick up things like ingredients, pans, or plates and the other to chop, cook, or wash them depending on the station you are standing in front of. But combine those simple controls with the stress of a ticking timer and cleverly designed levels made to mess with you at every possible turn and Overcooked becomes blissfully frantic.   Every stage is tailor-made to disrupt whatever game plan you may have, forcing your group to move around the map instead of just manning a single station for the whole round. The impulse at the start of most levels is to assign everyone a job – someone focuses on chopping, another person on cooking, while another handles moving plates and cleaning dishes. But what do we do when the pirate ship we’re cooking on shifts, causing the serving tables to slide, and suddenly the dishwasher is blocked off from the sink?  Those problem-solving moments are exhilarating, forcing us to swap roles on the fly.  Those problem-solving moments are exhilarating, forcing me and my teammates to swap roles on the fly without letting everything falling apart. That gets harder as stages get more elaborate and start involving more spectacular things like jumping between moving trucks or an earthquake literally splitting the kitchen in half. Its unexpected and downright strange level design keeps Overcooked fun all the way through the 40+ stages. There are icy levels that ask you to slip across frozen rivers, large lava pools with your cooking stations spread across drifting rocks, and eventually even shifting kitchens in space. The included Festive Seasoning DLC levels proved to be some of the hardest available by introducing stew, a significantly more complex meal to prepare when you are juggling five different orders with varying recipe lists. It pushed my and my team to figure out how to be more efficient with our actions and communicate better.   Overcooked gets more enjoyable the more people you have playing it, up to the max of four. It’s a wonderfully ridiculous mess with three or four players that still somehow has room for strategy, but plans can be calmly executed as a more tactical game with only two. Playing alone, on the other hand, you have to control two chefs by yourself, swapping between them to multitask. Simply put, Overcooked just wasn’t very much fun on my own – it turns into something more like an RTS than a party game and loses nearly all of the levity I usually love it for.  The low framerate is an annoying distraction in a game that rewards precision.  Because of that it’s a bummer that Overcooked doesn’t have online play, but, to be fair, even with voice chat it wouldn’t be quite as much fun without the frantic shouting that’s only possible when sitting right next to your teammates. Equally disappointing is that Overcooked: Special Edition doesn’t take advantage of the Switch’s capability for local wireless multiplayer across consoles either, which it would have been well suited for. On top of that, the transition to Switch seems have introduced a few other problems I wasn’t expecting, the most glaring of which is its framerate. Overcooked is a colorful and fun-looking game, but it’s not so intensive that a system that can run Zelda: Breath of the Wild should have problems running it smoothly. Yet the Switch version often runs at a noticeably low framerate, whether it’s docked or undocked, in a level or on the map, and with any number of players. Thankfully it doesn’t fluctuate or spike lower, but it’s still an annoying distraction in a game that rewards quick and precise movements.   The controller rumble is also legitimately busted. Your controller will shake when you do things like chopping and washing, but for some baffling reason every other player’s controller will also rumble along with your actions. So if I’m chopping while using the left Joy-Con, my teammate using the right one will also feel that shake, and vice versa. That makes it all but useless as feedback to your actions, and outright confusing for newer plains. These problems don’t ruin Overcooked’s Switch port, but they are distracting blemishes especially after having played a version without them. Even with the DLC included, I’ll undoubtedly be setting up the PC version (or at least the PS4 or Xbox One versions, which both run at a solid 30fps) next time I’m playing with friends at home thanks to the smoother framerate. On the road, of course, I’ll be grateful to have this with me. Overcooked is one of the freshest couch co-op games I’ve ever played. It’s a perfect blend of strategy and chaos, asking you and your teammates to think on your feet as its smart and strange levels do everything they possibly can to make sure you are shouting at each other. The Switch port has some framerate and rumble issues that keep it from matching the best versions available, but for local multiplayer fun it’s hard to beat.
Brendan Graeber	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	 It feels as if the paint had just begun to dry on Splatoon after its release on the Wii U in 2015 when Nintendo applied a fresh coat and relaunched it with Splatoon 2 on the Switch. That may be why this sequel feels less like a whole new game than a new version of the first one that rolls up the best post-launch updates to the colorful and adorably non-violent team-based shooter and adds some new toys. Of course, considering the first game is a lot of fun, that’s not necessarily a bad thing, especially if you missed it for lack of a Wii U. And despite some questionable choices that can leave you trapped in matchmaking purgatory, the addition of a standout and clever take on a co-op horde mode provides some seriously addicting fun that has me coming back for more. Like its predecessor, Splatoon 2‘s emphasis on using vibrant, ink-based weapons to splatter both enemies and the ground alike in your team color to control territory makes it a distinctive kind of visually rewarding fun. Controlling the ground is more than just a way of keeping score, though – you’re far more mobile in your own territory, creating lots of opportunity for strategies around creating a highway to an objective and cutting off your opponents, and also setting up areas to submerge into the ink and replenish your ammo. The key to victory on the eight distinct and symmetrical maps currently in rotation often lies in being aware of terrain, ink management, and the opposition’s plans.   Between the original arsenal, the guns added in post-launch updates, and the new ones introduced in Splatoon 2, there’s plenty of ink-based weaponry to choose from, and yet each type has distinct uses. There’s the fast and furious Inkbrush that covers ground quickly, contrasted with the Slosher that manages to turn a literal bucket of ink into a deadly close-range weapon. One of my favorites of the new batch is the Dualies, dual-pistol style weapons that have a great rate of fire and also let you quickly dodge-roll when firing to strafe enemies and release a concentrated burst of ink. There’s also a brand-new array of special weapon powerups, many of which work well with proper coordination to break stalemates. The protective Ink Armor shields your entire team from harm, while the Tenta Missiles can lock onto and fire a salvo of ink strikes on multiple enemies.  Obtaining new gear is a smoother process than in the first game.  Going hand in hand with Splatoon 2’s wealth of weapons is a set of gear that provides both style and bonuses in combat, with the added twist of over 20 random secondary abilities that unlock after you’ve battled with them equipped enough times. These range from practical effects, like increasing ink recovery rates, to highly specialized abilities that can track the enemy who last splatted you or players you’ve recently hit. Obtaining new gear is a smoother process than in the first game, too – you can now order any gear you’ve seen on other people in-game using currency earned from battle, though the abilities attached to yours might not be the same due to random generation. Paying to scrub unwanted extra traits to make room for new ones leaves chunks of those abilities behind to apply to other gear, letting you mix and match from your inventory, or you can try your luck at unlocking different bonuses to replace the old ones that better align with your playstyle. This is a good way get value out of gear you earned but don’t plan to wear: by scrubbing enough ammo-conserving bonuses from gear I wasn’t using, I was then able to apply that trait to my favorite jersey (for a hefty price). Offering the chance to craft the perfect gear for your playstyle to give you a better edge in the more competitive Ranked Battles has kept me more invested than I was in the first Splatoon.   With a world this colorful and fun, it’s great to see how much better people and places look on the Switch. Characters like the weapons dealer Sheldon and clothing merchant Jelfonzo look better than ever with more detailed models and textures, and the various forms of street art and graffiti scattered around the maps pop. The ink itself shimmers and glints with shiny flecks. Despite it all, Splatoon 2 never failed to maintain a smooth 60 frames per second in battle even with ink flying in all directions in a fully populated eight-player match. In handheld mode, things look great, and the option to set sensitivity for both modes of play helped immensely when switching between handheld and docked mode. I actually ended up swapping between motion and non-motion controls with surprising ease (though not being able to use the control stick to look up and down with motion and controls does take getting used to every time).     Splatoon 2 brings back a very familiar and simple 32-mission single-player campaign that, with some exceptions, follows the style of its predecessor almost to the letter. There’s a fair amount of hand-holding and will only take six or so hours to run through and find most collectibles, but missions provide some pretty fun ideas to play around with. There are places to stylishly grind on ink-rails like a squid version of Tony Hawk, and elsewhere you can lure giant, ink-vacuuming Squee-G robots into your enemies’ path. Spraying ink to activate expanding sponges or moving platforms gives it a light Super Mario Sunshine feel, but it rarely challenges you the way co-op and multiplayer do. The most significant improvement over Splatoon is that the sequel’s campaign lets you try out each of the weapon types, which is a great way to learn about their potential and how they can be used in multiplayer before jumping online. This focus on weapon research greatly extends replay value, as you can head back into levels you’ve already conquered to discover new challenges based on the weapons’ strengths and limitations. Heading into Splatoon 2’s main lobby lets you queue up for an engaging variety of online modes. Each mode automatically drops you in one of two maps that change up every two hours, which keeps things feeling fresh and doesn’t let a map wear out its welcome as quickly as in other games, where the community often picks a favorite and plays it to death. The standard Turf War mode, which carries over from the original, is welcoming for beginners and veterans alike with the simple yet entertaining concept of competing to ink the most territory in three minutes. No two matches ever feel the same because the battlefield hotspots – dictated by the competing colors of ink – are constantly changing, and several times being at the right place at the right time was what narrowly pushed our team to victory. This is one case where I actually miss the Wii U gamepad – without the second-screen map or an always-on-screen minimap, you have to hold a button to overlay a map to see how things are going or jump to a teammate’s location. This means you’ll need to be that much more alert to the status of your team and the terrain, and finding a safe spot to check the map overlay took some getting used to.  Being at the right place at the right time was what narrowly pushed our team to victory.  Besides Turf Wars, Ranked and League Battles are where more precise and objective-based modes await. There’s a king-of-the-hill-inspired Splat Zone, a tug-of-war style payload mode called Tower Control, and a spin on capture the flag where you carry a powerful but movement-impeding weapon to the enemy base called Rainmaker. Splat Zone is the most basic of the trio, and I prefer the modes where teams fight over a moving target like the mobile tower in Tower Control, and the Rainmaker weapon that was constantly changing hands. Even when both teams are working well together and locked in a tug-of-war for control, matches move at a quick pace, which prevents drawn-out stalemates. Even though Ranked Battles rotate between modes every few hours, I’m glad each mode has their own ranking system so I can see which modes I’m best at and where I need to improve.   The only real problems I’ve encountered so far are the lobby’s matchmaking system and the lack of a between-match loadout screen. Like in most games, once you’ve picked your mode of choice you’ll be sent to a room awaiting seven more players to begin. The catch is that nobody can cancel out or do anything else (such as the minigame the first Splatoon gave us to kill the time here) until either the match fills up or the timer runs out a couple of minutes later. Even if your group does fill up fast (which we can assume will be more likely after launch) and you get to play a round, you're still left with the problem of being unable to swap out weapons and gear between matches. I don’t mind not being able to switch during a match because that makes you carefully consider your choices and commit to the role your weapon fills, and the matches aren’t that long to begin with. But after playing with a great group and leveling up, the last thing I want to do is ditch them just so I can put on a new pair of shoes.   Where Splatoon 2’s single-player campaign gently guides you through Octoling enemies, the new Salmon Run mode is an excellent cooperative foil. As hilarious as it is addicting, this mode puts you and up to three other players up against three timed waves of relentless enemies while collecting a quota of golden eggs from boss creatures and depositing them in a basket. Unlike other horde modes, Salmon Run deftly uses Splatoon’s ink and territory mechanics to ensure you’re not only splatting fish but also struggling to maintain control of the ground as enemies try to stifle your movement. The Boss Salmonids you face are some of the most memorable enemies I’ve seen in a horde mode since Left 4 Dead, wielding trash as makeshift weapons and armor and shooting beams of ink from atop a tower of pots and pans. Their distinct looks help you assess threats quickly, which is essential because your team must neutralize them before being overwhelmed.   When playing online, you’ll be given one of four random weapons to use for every wave, and I love how it challenged me to adapt and fill new roles on my team: In one wave I was sniping bosses with the Splat Charger, but in the next wave I had to clear a path to the egg basket with the Roller instead. Difficulty can be set when playing locally, and steadily grows when online thanks to the randomized nature of enemy waves and weapon loadouts, boss configurations, and special events like rising water levels or egg-stealing mothership invasions. Those shifting conditions kept me coming back to see what would happen next.  The Boss Salmonids you face are some of the most memorable enemies I’ve seen in a horde mode since Left 4 Dead.  Playing locally with friends is a blast – my teammates and I frantically screamed out boss names and locations of golden eggs to direct each other to counter problems and capitalize on opportunities. But this also highlights how key communication is to survival, something that doesn’t currently translate well in random online matchups, where you can only give basic callouts. Fortunately, with Nintendo’s new companion app you can create voice chat groups with friends on your phone - but there are some significant problems. While you can check out nifty details about matches and order more gear from your app, the voice chat system feels woefully lacking. You can only chat with friends in certain modes, and while chatting your phone cannot be used for anything else (even turning off the screen will mute all conversation). Given that the app won’t let you talk to friends outside of specific lobbies, and that I’m not a fan of having my phone battery drained by a screen that can’t be turned off, I’m much more inclined to use Skype or Discord to talk with friends. And speaking of bizarre catches: for some reason, the excellent co-op mode can only be played online on certain days for specific amounts of time – for instance, 5:00AM to 5:00PM – which is truly frustrating considering just how fun it is. After a fun weekend playing with friends, finding out I can’t play again for two days can get annoying, especially when I can’t discern any rhyme or reason to the Salmon Run schedule. Not being able to easily remember the next available slot time forces me to constantly check in-game for the next five openings. I get that Nintendo wants to ensure full rooms on the days Salmon Run is active, but this seems like a poor way to do it. I’d rather have the option to queue up with friends online or have a way to easily back out if nobody is around to play with (going it alone is pretty much a death sentence). On the days the mode is active, you can earn quick rewards not found anywhere else which is a nice bonus; if you choose to play locally you can play as much as you want, but it takes much longer to earn bonuses. There’s a lot to love in Nintendo’s second iteration of its quirky shooter, especially the way Splatoon 2 emphasizes splatting the ground just as much as it does inking your opponents. The new additions to its single-player campaign and multiplayer modes are a step in the right direction, but it still has some work to do to make joining online games and voice chat less of a hassle. Still, with an addicting new Salmon Run co-op mode and the promise of free updates like the ones that helped the original Splatoon come into its own, I expect Splatoon 2 to keep me hooked.
Joe Skrebels	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/03/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-master-trials-dlc-review	 Anyone who bought Breath of the Wild’s Expansion Pass likely did so on the promise of its second, story-focused installment. With several months to go until the Champions’ Ballad DLC, however, Nintendo’s offered something of a stop-gap in the form of a grab-bag set of additions to its bucolic masterpiece. It may not be precisely what fans are clamoring for, but that might be its strength, as The Master Trials offers a couple of very pleasant surprises. The headline act, without any doubt, comes in the form of the Trial of the Sword. A new challenge mode of sorts, the Trial draws its primary idea from Breath of the Wild’s best challenge - Eventide Island. That tantalising landmass draws most players, siren-like, across the sea to its southeastern shores, before promptly stripping them of all their items, and facing them against a series of challenges, without the opportunity to save. Eventide is magnificent, somehow cramming ideas from survival games and XCOM’s Iron Man mode into the game’s already near-perfect structure. It challenged players to forget about the things they’d earned and engage purely with what they’d learned. Utilising Breath of the Wild’s many overlapping systems became the key to surviving (and winning little more than the pleasure of a save point at its final Shrine).   Trial of the Sword is Eventide on a grand scale. Provided you’ve earned the right to hold the Master Sword, you’ll have the option of plonking it right back into its pedestal and progressing through a series of 45 one-shot rooms, most of which are specific combat trials. You’ll begin with no armour, no weapons and no Divine Beast powers, scavenging what you can along the way. Die before you hit one of three checkpoints and you have to do it all again. Depending on your speed, that can mean anything up to a couple of hours’ progress can be lost if you’re not careful. This is truly something for Breath of the Wild’s endgame. The idea of centering an endgame challenge around combat - one of Breath of the Wild’s most simplistic features - might seem antithetical. That’s because combat is only the means of progression - the challenge comes from applying all your knowledge of the wider game. Sets of five stages work around similar themes, asking the player to engage with environmental conditions while killing off all of the stages’ occupants. One set takes place entirely in a thunderstorm, meaning you’re best off ditching any metal items you’re carrying (or even better off using them as lightning traps). Another sees you in a vertical wind tunnel of sorts, with enemies placed across floating platforms and almost all armed with bows and arrows, turning it as much into a test of your skilful paragliding as it is your slow-motion bow work. There are areas where you need to deal with constant cold without the clothing to withstand it, or simply defeat boss enemies with the scant resources you have left after all the preceding stages. Even its quiet interim stages (each one appearing after a mini-boss fight) are trials of a kind - you’ll need to turn what little food you have into the most effective possible recipes, and forage for as much as you can. Please, learn from my mistakes: lifesaving fairies run away if you sprint desperately up to them. Hitting each checkpoint in the Trial may offer a permanent 10-point damage buff to your Master Sword but, like Eventide, completing it all really is its own reward. It may not bring the sheer wonder of stumbling across the main game’s biggest surprises by accident - if you’re able to finish this, it will likely be because you’ve played enough to know how - but it condenses the mechanical joy of Breath of the Wild into a four-hour gauntlet. The upcoming story expansion is rightfully the most exciting post-release addition to the game, but it will genuinely have some trouble beating the pure, adrenal fun of making it through the Trial of the Sword.   That sets an unassailably high bar for the rest of the DLC pack, but much of the rest of the Master Trials’ additions are certainly welcome, if not hugely significant. Hero’s Path, for example, takes the last 200 hours of your time in the game and presents it as a scrawled track drawn across the game’s map (just press the minus button and hit X to see it). Designed primarily to show you areas you’ve missed while exploring, it’s an extremely useful new tool (I almost immediately spotted a whole jutting landmass I’d never bothered to travel around), but it’s just as pleasant when used as a short-form replay of your time in Hyrule. There’s an argument to be made that - in its capacity as a navigational feature - Hero’s Path should have been included in the game from the beginning, but the ability to watch it trace its way around the map in fast-forward adds a different dimension. There’s an odd nostalgia invoked as you watch your journey flitting around Hyrule: a shrine detour you remember taking, the first time you retreated from the Hebra mountains to get something warmer to wear, those three to four hundred deaths in the Yiga Clan hideout. That feeling could only really be achieved when used in hindsight. Few are likely to forget their first run around Breath of the Wild, so it’s nice to have the game itself acknowledge that fact. The Travel Medallion is another new, utilitarian feature that some will argue should have been in the game from the beginning. On this, I’m not as inclined to disagree. After you’ve found the medallion (following a short quest), it can be dropped anywhere, creating a bespoke fast travel point. It’s particularly useful for return trips to areas with materials to grind for, cutting out travel time from Shrines. Nintendo might argue that having it in the game from the beginning would have taken away from Breath of the Wild’s philosophy that players should have to interact with the world as much as possible, but adding the equivalent of a single movable Shrine doesn’t feel as though it would detract from that idea all too much. Either way, for those still on the hunt for the game’s rarest materials, this will be a boon.   The weakest addition comes in the form of new clothing items, all of which are direct references to past games: Midna’s helmet from Twilight Princess, Phantom Guardian armour from The Phantom Hourglass, Majora’s Mask. Most useful of all is the Korok Mask, which shakes when you’re near one of the game’s 900 hidden Koroks. Perhaps better, however, is the Tingle outfit, simply because it causes almost every NPC to recoil in horror when you approach. Each offers a dose of fan service but, barring the Korok Mask, the effects of each clothing item are familiar enough - attack buffs, higher speed at night, and the ability to avoid being spotted by certain enemies are all abilities present on existing armour. They’re clearly more suited to new players than those who’ve already dealt with the worst Hyrule has to offer. Given how much time has passed since release, it’s unlikely that the first group is larger than the second, making each feel a little underwhelming when you pick them up. To compound that problem, to avoid simply giving you each item Nintendo includes a set of hints to follow. Those hints, it tells you outwardly, correspond exactly with various areas in the Hyrule Field region. Unfortunately, for anyone who’s spent a fair bit of time in the Field, it turns what should be treasure hunting into a dull trudge from obvious point to obvious point, intermittently turning on the Magnesis power to spot a buried chest. These items are teed up as legendary relics of a forgotten past - finding them half-buried in an old barn seems a tad underwhelming. Simply put, it’s not a great deal of fun to find the items, and they’re not all that useful when you do.   Thankfully, there’s a final addition that adds a great deal more for those who’ve seen most of Breath of the Wild already. Only available from the main menu as a totally fresh start, Master Mode was previously referred to as Hard Mode by Nintendo, but it’s not difficult to see why it would opt for a more grandiose title upon release. This is a more creative increase in difficulty than most games’ upper levels. While allowing players only a single save slot and increasing each enemy type’s rank by one (red Bokoblins become Blue Bokoblins, for example) aren’t unfamiliar tactics, it has crueler ideas up its sleeve. Familiar enemy placements are disrupted, with new mobs ready to swarm you in unexpected places - not least with the addition of weird, floating platforms (held aloft, grimly, by still-living Octoroks) hovering above the Hyrule horizon. Plus, those enemies now regenerate health if you stop attacking them, and can spot you from further away. Nintendo’s clearly aiming to indulge those looking for a real New Game+ experience. Stronger enemies earlier on means that Link ends up better equipped than he would usually be, even before he leaves the Great Plateau tutorial area. On the other hand, the addition of what used to be the game’s hardest regular enemy, a Silver Lynel, in the Great Plateau speaks to how much of a challenge the mode will be. That there are entirely new, gold-ranked enemies (including Lynels) is a further promise. It won’t be for everyone (I guarantee some will throw in the towel after being killed by the game’s first enemy after 150 hours of play), but Master Mode is a fantastic way of adding a lot more by changing a little. That’s emblematic of the Master Trials DLC as whole. The Master Trials doesn’t make any epochal changes to the established Breath of the Wild formula, but by packing in one of the game’s best quests, some welcome new features, and a hard mode to be reckoned with, it more than paves the way for the starrier story expansion to come.
Brendan Graeber	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	 Ditching the more grounded world of Nintendo’s Punch-Out!, Arms is a far wackier take on the boxing genre. It’s an exciting face-off as you weave around incoming fists from afar, looking for that small opening to curve your powered-up glove straight into your foe or leap into the air for perfectly timed grab. Arms is bursting with fast-paced modes and colorful exploding gloves that make every fight a blast, and its stylish lobby system keeps me coming back for more. As you engage in cartoony fisticuffs with the eponymous stretchable boxing gloves, of which there are many shapes and sizes, the combat of Arms is easy to pick up. You can fight any way you please: with motion-controlled Joy-Con controllers, Pro Controllers, or even a single tilted Joy-Con. The motion-control setup works well enough, since instead of throwing huge punches and tiring yourself out, subtle jabs and tilts will get the job done. Tilting the controllers to move, curve punches, and block does take a bit of getting used to, and I had the tendency to unconsciously move my Joy-Cons at the wrong time. This led me to gravitate more towards the Pro Controller or playing in portable mode, using the analogue stick for precise movements and using triggers instead of buttons to throw punches.   What really matters in every match is movement: if you aren’t constantly strafing and jumping to dodge the projectile-like punches of your adversary, you’ll just be giving the match to your opponent. Rock’em Sock’em Robots, this is not. Equally important is charging up your Arms to deal bigger, elementally enhanced damage, but it’s a risk because pausing to charge can leave you open to attack. There’s a great sense of give and take here: for every move you can make, there’s an equal counter, and the delicate dance of trying to outsmart your competitors can lead to some very tense moments. There’s also plenty of room for surprises, as just one match against a player who effortlessly dodged my attacks had me stopping to rethink my strategies and swapping out my equipped pair of Arms to try a different approach. Character abilities factor into every matchup. Each of the 10 fighters has two innate abilities, such as Ribbon Girl’s multiple aerial jumps or Spring Man’s deflections. Some of these abilities can lend themselves well to developing new tactics, but others, like the fast-jumping but incredibly slow-dodging Kid Cobra, just feel like they got the short end of the stick.   The Arms themselves are all distinct enough that you’ll soon be able to spot which ones your rival has equipped and what they are capable of. While traditional Arms like the fiery Toaster are great for straight shots and breaking your opponents grab attempts, wide-arcing attacks from weapons like the Chakram and Thunderbird can flank from the sides.  Even variants of the same weapon type feel more pronounced than a simple reskin.  Most weapons can charge up to deal debilitating effects, although some felt a little more pronounced than others. Sure, having a wind effect to knock a fighter away from a powerup is nice, but not as nice as using electric attacks to completely shut down an opponent and leave them wide open to a grab, which does a ton of damage. Some types are rarer than others - giving them great unique appeal (Helix starts with the only blinding weapon, for instance) and even variants of the same weapon type feel more pronounced than a simple reskin when you compare the ice-encrusted Chilla to the gold-trimmed Bubb that doubles in size when charged.   You’re given access to every type of Arm from the start, but they are locked to specific fighters. If you want to rock a Guardian Arms with Spring Man, for example, be ready to shell out the money earned from fights in a target-hitting minigame for a chance at your desired glove appearing for the right fighter (and you’ll still have to unlock the Guardian again for every other fighter you want to use it with). I was hoping there would be a chance to be surprised with Arms nobody had in their default loadout (thirty Arms is still a pretty diverse selection), but there are some interesting choices to be made mixing a fighter’s abilities with the unlocked Arms of another fighter. Pairing up Ninjara’s quick movements with some of the freezing and electric Arms let me capitalize on his speed that I couldn’t achieve with his default loadout.   If you were worried 1v1 brawling would get boring, Arms does a good job of giving you plenty of alternate modes to choose from - and most every mode can be played solo or split-screen co-op, including the traditional 10-round Grand Prix campaign with scaling difficulty. The 1v100 mode gives you a lesson in endurance as you take on small groups of weak enemies until a final tough opponent. Modes like V-Ball, Hoops, and Skill Shot are nice diversions that are quick and concise, though getting walled off from your opponent by a large obstructing net playing explosive volleyball isn’t as fun or engaging as those that let you antagonize or otherwise go head to head. Getting tethered to another player in team battles was exhilarating, as I worked to defend my buddy from getting grabbed and timed rush attacks with the openings my partner created. That said, having the lock-on view constantly switching between targets on its own without my input got frustrating at times.    Players rarely go too long without being placed or paired up with other fighters.  The mode that really deserves a medal here is Party Match. This online mode transports you to a constantly shifting lobby area that’s almost as fun to watch as it is to take part in. Groups of up to 20 players (10 systems with two players each) are continually shuffled about as the lobby decides who should be matched up in the circles it creates. This means players rarely go too long without being placed or paired up with other fighters, and the lobby adapts to odd numbered groups by making frantic free-for-alls, grouping up against intimidating AI bosses, or letting local players take turns. Even when I wasn’t in a match, I was hungrily absorbing the clever layout of each fight taking place in the lobby – seeing the health bars drop, rush attacks trigger, and the timer wind down around the circle until the players were jettisoned out of the circle to seek a new match. Ranked Battles offer a little more structure, and I was happy to find friend lobbies offer a lot of customization to pick and choose what kind of matches the lobby would pull us into - including the ability to choose possible stages, modes, and how much prize money was needed to be declared the lobby winner. Arms’ clever take on boxing provides a simple premise with a startling amount of depth for those who would seek to master the stretching appendages. Its rapidly evolving lobby system had me sticking around for “just one more match.” There may not be a lot worth unlocking right now, but planned free updates may just give Arms some additional legs.
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	 At this point, Minecraft is such a well-known game that reviewing its content in 2017 seems redundant. (For that, you can check out our reviews of the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions and of Minecraft: Pocket Edition.) But with its recent release on the Switch the question that needs answering is how Nintendo’s portable console handles building these fantastic blocky worlds, and the answer is: pretty well. The Switch Edition of Minecraft takes the appealing portability of Minecraft Pocket Edition and adds the precise, comfortable controls of a console. The convenience of playing Minecraft on the go and easily jumping into online multiplayer with friends on their own Switch devices would make it hard to go back to other versions of if it weren’t missing an essential feature: voice chat. That makes playing with friends who aren’t in the room with you much less fun, since there’s no way to coordinate your efforts with the up to seven other players in a game. You can get that human interaction locally by playing two-player split-screen mode, but this works much better when the Switch is docked, because the screen is a little too small to play in handheld or kickstand mode with multiple people. It’s possible, you just might not be able to see very well.    You can play split-screen in tabletop mode, you just can't see very well. Like the current PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions (1.5), the Switch’s Minecraft lacks some other features that are on the PC’s 1.9 version, like the reworked combat system. And, unfortunately, Minecraft doesn’t use the Switch’s touch screen for faster inventory management – or anything else – so it’s not quite the best of both the console and Pocket Edition worlds. It does include a bunch of exclusive Super Mario-themed skins, though. Lastly, I didn’t experience any noticeable slowdowns either in docked or portable modes, though it’s worth noting that Minecraft runs in 720p even while docked. Not that the resolution of these intentionally blocky graphics matters much, of course.   The Nintendo Switch version provides an authentic Minecraft experience that is hugely benefitted by the ability to play it anywhere with physical controls. The one drawback is the lack of voice chat, which makes online multiplayer less fun than on other platforms, so it’s best enjoyed in the same room as your friends.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/25/mr-shifty-review	 The heist at the heart of Mr. Shifty kicks off with an explosive bang, like a pulpy late-‘80s action movie. You play the role of a mysterious super-powered criminal whose nifty ability to teleport across short distances and punch unsuspecting foes in the face keeps Mr. Shifty’s momentum going despite a story that soon becomes forgettable (like a pulpy late-’80s action movie), but not through the awful slowdown issues in its final act. The best moments of Mr. Shifty made me feel like a complete, no-nonsense comic book badass. By using a combination of your warping ability and some quick melee reflexes you can take out a group of gun-toting security guards and beat them to a satisfying pulp before they can get off the one shot that would kill you if it connects, or you can get crafty and carefully guide a seeking missile back toward the turret that fired it. You can still sense vague feelings of badassery when you bypass laser grids or warp past unaware guards. The art direction uses heavy shadows on Mr. Shifty’s blue trench coat and environments, giving the colorful backdrops an inky, comic book vibe that fits into the overall tone.   The best moments of Mr. Shifty made me feel like a no-nonsense comic book badass And like a comic action hero, Shifty won’t touch the guns dropped by his prey, but he will pick a handful of melee weapons to beat his foes. I have to admit there’s a level of satisfaction that comes from using a broom to smack down a whole group of enemies in one swing, but it doesn’t come close to the invincible feeling I got when I tossed an indestructible shield and watched it bounce off of a row of oncoming enemies. It was easily one of my favorite sequences; one turned me into a nearly unstoppable hybrid of the X-Men’s Nightcrawler and Captain America. Outside of occasionally wonky collision detection, like the time I saw a shield disappear through a wall, Shifty’s melee combat is savagely violent and fun to execute, but cartoony enough to get by. All of Mr. Shifty’s power is balanced out by the fact that a single mistake at any moment can still get you killed, just like in its clear inspiration, Hotline Miami. Death tosses you back to the start of a level, which isn’t a huge inconvenience, but some of the tough late-game levels of the 18-stage campaign will leave you wishing for a checkpoint or two. But you can avoid death once in awhile: by chaining together enough beatdowns you can build up a special meter that will automatically initiate a slow-motion sequence to let you save yourself from an enemy’s bullet. It’s a nice effect that bails you out of starting over and gives you another neat way to pummel bad guys.    Mr. Shifty starts out with some good action, but its performance issues on Switch cause annoying hiccups Mr. Shifty starts out with some good, smooth action, but its performance problems on Switch cause annoying hiccups that makes the last third horribly sluggish. The biggest issues crop up late in the campaign when the antagonist, a bland collection of supervillain cliches named Mr. Stone, uses a machine to warp in goons at random to fight you. The awful dropped frames and sluggishness that happen as foes warp in from all sides is a punishment that even a notorious thief like Mr. Shifty doesn’t deserve. Developer Team Shifty says an upcoming patch will address these issues, but it wasn’t available in time for this review. Even if that’s fixed, being forced to listen to Mr. Shifty’s mundane rock soundtrack for the five hours it took to finish it is another form of abuse entirely.  It’s also surprising that Mr. Shifty doesn’t offer many reasons to pick it once you’re done. The story is an uninteresting smash-and-grab burglary with groan-worthy characters and dialogue that aren’t interesting enough to go back to. It also doesn’t have leaderboards, so outside of replaying a stage to lower your level completion time or finish one with fewer deaths, there’s little reason to revisit this caper. Mr. Shifty is an okay brawler that uses a stylish warping ability as a cool way to get the drop on unsuspecting foes. While it’s fun to smack down security goons with quick melee skills, the horrible framerate of the final act will test your patience. If you do endure and manage to drop the final boss, Mr. Shifty doesn’t present enough reasons to replay it.
Casey DeFreitas	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	 Puyo Puyo Tetris combines the blob-color matching puzzle playstyle of Puyo Puyo with the well-known Tetris, making for a “frantic four-player puzzle mashup,” as advertised, with an impressive amount of content and game modes that often have you and your opponents playing entirely different games side by side, yet still in direct competition. Simply slamming two famously addictive puzzle games together is much more likely to make an abomination than something as good or better than either piece, but here it’s pulled off well thanks to a variety of well thought-out modes that complement each other. The basic idea of Puyo Puyo hasn’t changed much since we saw it in the more recognizable Kirby’s Avalanche and Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine: color-coded blobs, called puyo, fall from above in twos, and you must match four of the same colors to “pop” them. It sounds simple, but the complexity comes from the fact that matching them as fast as possible won’t make you a puyo-popping master. To really rack up points, chains of puyos must be carefully placed so that when one set is popped a cascading waterfall of combos follows. Tetris, of course, hasn’t changed at all either, but the modes that combine the two into a single game keeps things interesting for both the solo and multiplayer modes, which support up to four players locally and online.  With six Challenge modes, five Arcade modes, Lessons, and a 100-stage Adventure mode, there is plenty to keep you busy. Versus, Party, and Big Bang can be played with either Puyo Puyo or Tetris, against an opponent using either as well. This is great when playing against friends with experience in only one of the game types, but Puyo Puyo is admittedly slightly easier to gain the upper hand when up against Tetris. A combo of two in Puyo Puyo is enough to send at least some garbage to your opponent, which is arguably easier than setting up a four-line clear or combo in Tetris.  The Tetris player is at a slight disadvantage. Versus is straight forward: make combos in Puyo Puyo, or clear four lines at once in Tetris, to send garbage to your opponent. In Party, items on the board can be cleared with puyos and tetriminos to activate attacks or buffs. The Tetris player is at a slight disadvantage here, too, as one attack causes pieces to drop at an incredibly fast pace, making it significantly more difficult for the Tetris player to evenly distribute dropping tetriminos. Big Bang puts players in Frenzy mode in Puyo Puyo, and Lucky Attack mode in Tetris, creating a fast-paced rush to make huge combos with preset boards until the timer runs out. It’s an especially frantic mode that compares scores when the time ends, depleting HP based on the score discrepancy between players. If all players are still standing after the attack, a new round begins and so on until there’s only one left. This mode is a bit more balanced than Versus or Party when sizing up Puyo Puyo and Tetris head to head.  Swap and Fusion combine both Puyo Puyo and Tetris in different ways. In Swap, two boards--one for Puyo Puyo and one for Tetris--are managed alternatively after a set time. This is the most balanced mode that combines both game types and works very well. It adds an extra layer of strategy, forcing players to time combos so that garbage is repeatedly sent to the same board to maximize nuisance.  Good luck if your first tetrimino is an S or a Z. In Fusion mode, puyos can change colors, pieces switch between tetriminos and puyos as they drop, and frustratingly, once a tetrimino touches anything on the board, it can’t be moved. It becomes increasingly more difficult the higher the board is stacked, preventing you from trying to set up large combos with puyos. Also because tetriminos can’t be moved once they touch something, they can’t be slid into an open slot beneath a block as in regular Tetris mode, either. So good luck if your first tetrimino is an S or a Z. The saving grace is that tetriminos clear the garbage it falls on, and it does add a whole new level of strategy to both Puyo Puyo and Tetris, as a falling tetrimino will reposition any puyos it passes. There’s a steep, steep learning curve to Fusion, as it doesn’t always follow the rules of the individual games. The single-player Adventure mode, which includes every variety of game type, will take about nine hours to complete by someone of average skill level. The difficulty scales very well, too, starting out fairly easy with basic Puyo Puyo and Tetris Versus modes, steadily increasing the AI’s difficulty, and adding in more modes, the most difficult being Fusion.  The story in Adventure mode is actually quite entertaining. I’m usually not one for handholding, but Puyo Puyo Tetris has a feature called Help mode in Adventure mode that lets you entirely skip a stage if it’s failed at least three times in a row. This comes in handy with the few frustrating levels and prevented me from putting down the Switch for extended periods of time – which is apt to happen with some level-based games. I ended up skipping two levels in Adventure mode after smashing my face into them for more than an hour, and they were both Puyo Puyo Tetris Fusion. That’s a pretty big tell about this new mode’s design, but because of the aforementioned Help mode it didn’t entirely bar my access to the rest of the game, which would have been especially unfortunate considering the story in Adventure mode is actually quite entertaining. For a puzzle game, Puyo Puyo Tetris has a ton of personality. It’s colorful cast of 24 characters is just as dazzling as the popping puyos and bursting tetriminos, and their snappy, silly dialogue (in English as opposed to its native Japanese!) kept things interesting between stages in Adventure mode. Because of this I never skipped through the story, and although it was definitely ridiculous, it was inane in the best way possible. Who doesn’t love a guy who speaks solely in fish puns, or relate to a powerful wizard with an even more powerful sweet tooth? A man after my own heart. Each of the characters has different playstyles, too, keeping challenges fresh throughout Adventure mode. The beautifully presented Puyo Puyo Tetris has a ton of content, a really fun multiplayer with a lot of variations, and is very easy to pick up and play with just about anyone despite the slight balance issues. The Nintendo Switch is a great platform for it too, with its portability and non-threatening Joy-Con controllers. This is the type of game that offers an adequate challenge for even the most hardcore puzzle players with its Challenge modes, but is inviting for even the smallest of children and gaming newbies.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe for Nintendo Switch is a souped-up version of the Wii U’s Mario Kart 8. When I reviewed Mario Kart 8 almost three years ago, I thought it was an amazing game and awarded it a score of a 9.0. Here’s what I said then: “Mario Kart 8 is the best kart racing game Nintendo has made in a long time. It strikes a careful balance between refining old ideas while introducing fresh new ones. Admittedly, its gorgeous graphics and jazzy orchestrated soundtrack bolster its presentation, but you’re getting a lot more than just looks with this one – although I spent an awful lot of time gawking at the details in slow-motion, the fast and furious pace of racing with friends both locally and online is what really kept me coming back.”  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe includes all of that, plus all the previously released DLC along with some new additions. That means you’re getting 48 great courses and 42 diverse characters, including new ones like Bowser Jr. and the Inklings from Splatoon, and some neat extras like the unbelievably fast 200cc speed class. Every course, character, and mode is unlocked right from the start, meaning you can just jump right in and hit the track. The one oddly executed addition is Smart Steering, a new feature designed to help keep novice players on the road. It isn’t a bad idea at all to consider newcomers to help them understand a game with a simple ruleset like Mario Kart, but Nintendo chose to leave Smart Steering on by default and it isn’t immediately clear how to turn it off in the menus. Barring that annoying little quirk, this collection is high-quality kart racer with lots of content.    It’s just as amazing in 2017 as it was in 2014 Mario Kart 8 Deluxe looks great on the Switch, too! It’s just as amazing in 2017 as it was in 2014, and great art direction is a major reason that the graphics have stood the test of time. The course designs, in particular, are top notch – I love the way Mario Circuit twists and bends like a Mobius strip. Even remade tracks, like SNES Rainbow Road or F-Zero’s Mute City, have remarkable detail that is noticeable whether you’re playing handheld or on a TV. The framerate does drop from 60 to 30 frames per second if you play on a single Switch with three or four players, but that’s hardly a dealbreaker when the racing looks this good. If you already have the Wii U version, the real reason to pick up Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is the revamped Battle mode. Nintendo added five smart objective-based modes, and each one brings its own unique competitive angle to its eight varied arenas. In Balloon Battle, you have to take advantage of items and smart positioning to score points by popping your rivals’ balloons. Shine Thief is a wacky, action-packed riff on keep away. Bob-bomb Blast is an explosive, over-the-top face-off. I wish I were more motivated to play Coin Runners, though. Gathering or swiping coins from others is okay, but not nearly as exciting by comparison.   The biggest highlight is the suspenseful fight-or-flight nature of Renegade Roundup. It’s a round-based mode where a team of outlaws desperately tries to avoid a squad of Piranha Plant cops until the timer runs out. If a teammate is captured, you can free them with some skillful driving, but it comes at the risk of getting caught and losing the match if you’re the last man standing. That sets up tense make-or-break moments that can be genuinely thrilling with the right team. You can play any of these modes against bots of varying intelligence, but the real fun is online.  Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s online suite is still as barebones an experience That said, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe’s online suite is still as barebones an experience on the Switch as it was on the Wii U. Some of its improvements are notable – for example, it’s faster to get you into a game, and you can finally swap characters or karts between races. But the Switch still feels like a hassle next to the convenience of other systems because you still have to use outside means (like your phone) to communicate with friends. It’s aggravating that there’s no way to invite players to join your matches, too. Considering this is the first major online multiplayer game for Switch, it’s disappointing to see that so little was done to smooth out that experience. Mario Kart 8 Deluxe is an amazing game for all the same reasons I mentioned in our original review. It’s still a gorgeous kart racer and every bit as addictive as it was in 2014. This is the best entry in the series so far, and it has all the content you’ll need. Returning players have seen a lot of this game before, but the overhauled Battle mode and its five additional ways to play are a great reason to pick it up. Nintendo didn’t do enough to make the online experience better, but the rest of this game holds up well.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	 All high-scoring runs inevitably come to an end in Graceful Explosion Machine, but the process of stringing together a killer run is a satisfying adrenaline rush. The action looks straightforward, but the smart and distinctive weapon system of this 2D shoot-em-up fuels some clever combat ideas and adds a thrilling edge to battles with colorful alien spaceships. The mechanics behind Graceful Explosion Machine are deceptively simple, but you can see how it draws inspiration from other standout games like Resogun and Geometry Wars. It creates variety by setting its crowded ship battles inside of looping hallways or tight confined spaces instead of setting them all on a regular sidescrolling map. The vibrant 2D graphics are based on simple geometry that looks clean whether you’re playing on a TV or in handheld mode, and I enjoyed the small ripple effects that trigger after explosions.  Enemies are composed of basic shapes, but they each have unique attack behaviors that give them loads of personality. Some foes will rush in the minute they lock on your position, while others switch to evasive maneuvers to distract you while others – such as one of my favorites, which looks like an adorable mini Death Star – slowly move into position before firing a powerful laser at you. The variety of enemies could be a little better since the tougher ones don’t appear until the last two worlds, but overall you’ll still see plenty to shoot in the 36-level campaign. Based on your skills, each stage could take anywhere from five to 10 minutes to complete, but the old-school requirement to clear each of them with only two retries per level before you’re sent all the way back to the beginning is a challenging task that kept me coming back.  Like any good 2D shmup, every shot fired is an opportunity to build up your score multiplier Like any good 2D shmup, every shot fired is an opportunity to chain together enemy kills and build up your score multiplier, but this is where Graceful Explosion Machine’s combat branches off into its own with some clever ideas. In addition to your basic gun you have access to four unique weapons, but each one comes with a limitation that makes you consider when to use it beyond simply what’s most effective against which enemy. The Blaster, for instance, is a close-to-mid range option that doesn’t use a lot of power, but it can overheat quickly. The Energy Sword delivers a satisfying 360-degree attack that cuts through alien ships and destroys incoming bullets, but it uses up more power. The long-range Sniper Beam significantly slows your movement speed, making it dangerous to use around any fast-moving enemies, while the burst-fire missiles will burn through your energy meter faster than anything else if fired frequently.  Spamming these powerful weapons can kill an immediate threat, but it will also leave you vulnerable until your power recharges on its own. The challenge comes not just from staying alive, but from continually rotating through all of your weapons, grabbing replenishing energy crystals from downed enemies, and building strategies based on the situation.  The way you can feel different explosions adds texture to the intense shootouts For example, prioritizing my Sniper Beam to take out a tough shielded enemy can quickly free up a large chunk of screen space to give you room to breathe. But that’s no good against the giant blue centipede creatures that dash forward the minute it gets a lock on your tiny ship – you have to quickly switch to Missiles or the Energy Blade to counter that, and make sure you have power available to make use of it when you need it. Some combinations of foes can be pure evil in a crowded space, making quick switching between weapons essential. The fact that you’re wrestling away secure areas for your ship to run to while keeping an eye on your power meter makes it an intense game compared to other shoot-em-ups I’ve played. Graceful Explosion Machine is also the first game outside of 1-2-Switch to make use of the Switch’s HD Rumble. It’s not an essential feature, but the way you can feel different explosions and the way ship’s boost thrusters ramp up and down adds texture to all the intense shootouts. Graceful Explosion Machine builds an intense, addictive shoot-em-up around a satisfying weapon-juggling system and smart enemies. The Switch’s HD Rumble adds a unique feeling to every explosion in this colorful shooter, and earning a good spot on the leaderboard is an intense challenge thanks to dense swarms of enemies. But even when a pesky foe slapped down my scoring run, I always had the urge to jump back into these crowded corridors and try again.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/05/lego-city-undercover-review-2	 When we first reviewed LEGO City Undercover for Wii U in March 2013, we declared it great and awarded it an 8.0 out of 10. Here’s what we said then:   LEGO City Undercover is the best iteration of a very familiar experience, which is as reassuring or problematic as that might seem. The sheer scope of the overworld is impressive, as is the way Traveller’s Tales layered in its wide range of collectible goodies, which ensures hours upon hours of activity after the campaign ends, which should take the average player about 10 hours, accounting for some collectible fetching. Undercover’s story is an incredibly entertaining homage to countless movies and television shows, and manages to feature a very strong cast of characters – no small feat considering the game has no major license associated with it. Of course, rampant loading times, no co-op and a variety of other problems (loading times, routine gameplay) hold Undercover back from truly taking the next step for the larger LEGO franchise.   That’s still for the most point where we stand on it today, with the main difference being the inclusion of local two-player co-operative play for the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch and PC versions of the game. This brings the updated release of LEGO City Undercover more in line with the vast majority of LEGO titles from Traveler’s Tales, as a second player can now drop in and drop out at any point.  Admittedly co-op support in LEGO City Undercover is pretty barebones. Rather than introduce a second character into the game’s story, player two is just a palette-swapped version of main hero Chase McCain. Furthermore there are no specific missions, puzzles, or activities designed to cater to co-operative play, it’s the exact same content as the Wii U version only it can be tackled with two of you brick-smashing your way to success instead of one. Having said that, it’s still a fun sandbox to muck around in with a second player particularly given the presence of some 100 different vehicles to thrash about, and certainly the addition of co-op helps to make this re-release of LEGO City Undercover superior to the original to some degree. The only other major difference is the migration of the Wii U’s second screen features onto a single screen. LEGO City Undercover hardly made the most of the Wii U Gamepad anyway, so these tweaks have a fairly minor impact on the experience as a whole. It’s certainly more convenient to have video communications windowed in the corner of the main screen rather than having to keep looking down in your lap while you’re driving somewhere, and although controlling the environment scanner with thumbsticks isn’t quite as fun as physically holding up the Gamepad was, it’s no less functional. (It does however seem slightly odd that Chase McCain’s slab-like police communicator device still looks exactly like the Wii U Gamepad it was originally designed to imitate.)  Each version of the re-released LEGO City Undercover runs at 1080p (including the Switch version, when docked) and at a more stable frame rate compared to the original (with the exception of the un-docked Switch version, which features a slightly choppier frame rate reminiscent of the Wii U original). The visuals are otherwise unchanged, but I wasn’t exactly expecting the addition of high resolution textures or anything since well, almost everything in the game is made out of smooth-surfaced LEGO bricks. What I had hoped for was some level of optimisation for the load times, but unfortunately this doesn’t appear to be an area that developer TT Fusion has given much love. While it varies marginally between platforms, LEGO City Undercover still features generally sluggish load times. Even the Switch version, which I downloaded digitally and have running off a high speed Micro SD card, can still take anywhere from 30 seconds to a full minute when transitioning from an interior to the open world, which is a lengthy period of time to regularly stare at a static screen no matter how much you enjoy the incredibly funky ‘70s wah-wah wocka-ing that accompanies it. If you’ve already played the original LEGO City Undercover on Wii U, then there is little reason to pick up this re-release. However, if you were one of the many who missed it the first time around then LEGO City Undercover remains a hilarious riff on police procedurals, built upon a GTA-for-juniors open world blueprint, and stuffed with enjoyable side missions and collectibles to hunt down. The addition of split-screen play, cursory in its execution as it may be, only makes the game more appealing to players who would prefer to experience LEGO City Undercover with a friend riding shotgun. And what's a good police story without a partner in crime-fighting?
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	 When we reviewed The Binding of Isaac Rebirth on PC and Playstation 4, we thought it was an amazing game and awarded it a score of 9.0. Here’s what we said then: “The time I’ve spent with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has been non-stop fun and surprises, with just a tad too much frustration when I lose a rare item. But even when it slaps me down harder than I’d have liked, starting again is always a treat, because I’m likely to discover something new and darkly comedic. That’s plenty of motivation to keep right on playing this amazing game.” The Binding of Isaac Afterbirth+ includes a new expansion plus all of the previous DLC, and it further fleshes out Isaac’s replayable, addictive gameplay formula by offering more of what made the original shoot ‘em up action game so great. The almost non-stop variety, mysterious powerups, and procedurally generated maps are just as cryptic and challenging as they were before, but now you can play even longer without ever seeing the same thing happen twice.  I can’t tell you how unexpected it was to find X-ray glasses that showed me secret rooms hidden in the dungeon, or how silly it felt to step into one and discover a golden turd that spits out coins when I shot it. I’ve never seen those glasses or that shiny turd again, but almost every power up has a potential story like this that’s both funny and messed up, and it's a satisfying part of what makes The Binding of Isaac special. The chances of discovering something you haven’t seen before is overwhelmingly in your favor. And the variety is off the charts across all categories. Afterbirth+ boasts a total of over 600 items, 180 enemy types, and more than 90 deadly bosses. It’s a lot see, but the included trackers will help you keep up with what you’ve found -- along with other neat stats, like enemy HP or how many times you’ve killed something. It’s also a painful way to track the long, hard road you’ll need to take to unlock all 20 of Afterbirth+’s ending sequences.  As helpful as this info is, Afterbirth+ still relies on external wiki sources if you want to get more detailed information on what items actually do. I don’t think I would have ever figured out that passive collectibles like the Acid Baby drops pills after every two rooms, or that the Tonsil trinket has a small chance to summon a familiar that can block enemy shots without looking it up. It may be frustrating to not know what subtle effects certain items have the first time you find them, but Afterbirth uses that to fuel your curiosity. I can’t tell you how many times I held my breath as I pulled the trigger just see if a special item would help or hurt my run. It’s a satisfying dice roll and, after enough experimentation, you start to learn what special items are effective and what to avoid. The mystery surrounding items makes for an addictive game of chance that will constantly throw you curveballs, and never feels predictable. Afterbirth+ on Nintendo Switch runs at 60 frames per second on both the TV and the handheld screen. Since the Switch can quickly detect additional controllers, it is easy to add up to three more players for drop-in co-op, and co-op works great with the individual Joy-Con controllers turned sideways. The default settings are fine, but you can remap every button action to fit your playstyle. Adding a support character come with some risk, since it sacrifices one of your hearts, but I’ve seen it pay off with OP item combinations that can help two players breeze through dungeon rooms. The Binding of Isaac: Afterbirth+ adds more of what we loved about the original and keeps the formula fresh. It’s a tough game, but one that balances challenge with a refreshing feeling of the unexpected. The unpredictable items and varied enemies make it one of the most wacky and replayable games I’ve ever experienced.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	 Blaster Master Zero is built upon the same offbeat premise of the 1988 original - a young boy, Jason, follows a frog through an interdimensional portal and winds up exploring a series of mutant-infested subworlds in an upgradable jumping tank. It’s a pretty silly set up, but developer Inti Creates doesn’t allow the paper-thin plot to stand in the way of a mostly fun Metroidvania-style exploration experience - even if the combat is surprisingly easy for a classic-style platformer. What distinguishes Blaster Master Zero from many other games of its type is the ability to switch control between the SOPHIA III tank and go on-foot as Jason. (Heavy Rain fans take note, you literally press X to Jason in this game). That creates several distinct types of gameplay, which gives Blaster Master Zero an uncommon variety. Jason is far more vulnerable than the more rugged SOPHIA III, not to mention prone to instant death when falling from even modest heights, but his more diminutive stature allows him to crawl through tunnels in the terrain in order to access switches and the like that are otherwise blocked off from the tank.  It’s in these side-scrolling hubworlds that I found Blaster Master Zero to be at its best, purely for how well it rewarded me for exploring it. Upgrades unlocked along the way, such as the ability to drive up walls and along ceilings or boost up to higher ledges, leant themselves to backtracking and discovering hidden areas and power-ups. Elsewhere, the distinct features of each of setting, such as the use of switches in the ice station to freeze and unfreeze pools of water in order to navigate to new areas, brought additional variety to how I traversed the world. Dotted around the eight main hubworlds are dungeon doors that can only be accessed by Jason. Once inside, Blaster Master Zero switches to a top-down shooter and Jason suddenly becomes an exponentially more powerful mutant hunter. Outside of the dungeons Jason’s only weapon is a popgun of a blaster which makes every step he takes an exciting risk; inside them he has an arsenal of nine different blaster types plus upgradeable sub weapons that range from simple grenades at the start through to full-on airstrikes launched remotely by the SOPHIA III later on, making him a markedly overpowered one-man mutant extermination squad. In an attempt to balance out his power, Jason’s blaster types have their own health bar of sorts; the more hits he takes the weaker the assortment of attacks at his disposal. Yet so many aspects of the dungeon areas are designed to keep Jason at his most devastating, to the point where most of Blaster Master Zero’s combat presents almost zero challenge. Health and weapon pickups are plentiful and the majority of enemies can only fire vertically and horizontally, which means you can hang back and murder them diagonally from the safety of their blind spot. It’s as though you’re the only bloodthirsty bishop on a chessboard covered in dim-witted pawns.  Certainly, it was rare in my eight-hour playthrough of Blaster Master Zero that I found myself without access to Jason’s most powerful main attack, the Wave weapon. Firing three high-powered rounds simultaneously, it’s able to cut through walls that enemy fire can’t penetrate, which meant for the most part I was able to kill everything in my path from a screen’s width away without ever being exposed to danger. It also brought a premature end to boss fights - Inti Creates may have choreographed some complex attack patterns for Blaster Master Zero’s biggest nasties, but they needn’t have bothered since the majority of them were dispatched in a frenzied few seconds’ worth of button spamming. Add to that the modern conveniences of generous checkpoints and unlimited lives, and Blaster Master Zero never offers an old-school level of adversity to match its charmingly chunky 8-bit aesthetic. There’s a certain level of satisfaction to be gained from slaughtering pixels left and right, but I would have preferred at least some resistance along the way. Since there’s no option to increase difficulty or tackle a New Game+ mode after you complete the campaign, Switch owners after a meatier challenge served up in a retro skin would be better off picking up Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. While it’s a shame that its dungeon dwelling enemies are far too easily exploited, Blaster Master Zero is ultimately an enjoyable reimagining of a largely overlooked 8-bit classic thanks to the rewarding exploration-focussed structure of its side-scrolling overworld. There are enough secret rooms and power-ups to seek out (including an additional ending), that I was compelled to scour every last inch over the course of my eight-hour completion time. It’s a good reboot; just not a Masterful one.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	 The Nintendo Switch isn’t unlike a NASA spacecraft, in that nearly every part of it has been specially designed to pull double or even triple duty. The system’s modular design means that it has to function as a traditional home console, a portable system, and stand-alone touchscreen tablet with wireless controllers. Getting a piece of hardware to do that much while also making it easy to use and understand would be an engineering miracle, and although Nintendo has come close in some regards, it has fallen well short in others. Overall, the Switch is an attractive and powerful but oversized portable gaming system that struggles to be a convincing or reliable home console.  The first thing that struck me about the Switch is the overall quality of its look and feel. Regardless of whether you go for the neon blue and red set or the more subtle gray pair, the handsome matte finish of the two included Joy-Con controllers feels almost silken, begging to be touched. The console itself – the central tablet piece – is almost alarmingly small and thin when placed next to the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, or even the Wii U, but its mostly metal construction gives it a sturdy, substantial heft. At the same time, it’s still under a pound with both Joy-Con attached, making it comfortable to hold for long periods. (See the full dimensions and weight breakdown in our Nintendo Switch Wiki.) Even small details like the way the Joy-Con snap into place on the included Joy-Con Grip to form something resembling a conventional controller convey a premium feeling – the kind of gadget lust that has eluded Nintendo for generations now.   The Switch’s dock and the Joy-Con Grip are little more than two simple pieces of plastic that allow this handheld to dress up like a home console. The dock itself is as barebones as can be; it’s essentially just a combination HDMI and USB passthrough/charging station. It definitely works as advertised: within a couple of seconds of dropping the tablet onto the dock the picture transfers right over to the TV, and after detaching the Joy-Con (or syncing a separately purchased Pro Controller) you’re ready to play. The transition back to handheld mode is just as seamless – just grab the Switch out of the dock – which is definitely impressive. Even the time from startup to actually launching and playing a game is surprisingly short, and resuming from sleep is nearly instantaneous. The Grip completes the Switch’s console transformation, housing the left and right Joy-Con to form what feels like the most traditional controller Nintendo has made since the Super Nintendo. This Voltron-esque configuration won’t be beating Sony’s Dual Shock 4 anytime soon, but it’s far more comfortable and functional than I’d imagined it would be from just looking at it. The Joy-Con never felt quite like home the way a great controller should.  The smallish face buttons are sufficiently clicky and easy to hit, but the lack of a traditional D-pad or full-sized analog triggers will put it at a disadvantage for certain types of games. The Minus button (think Select or Back) is very oddly placed, though: it’s so small and so close to the left analog stick that I can barely hit the button without nudging the stick. Speaking of the analog sticks, they work well enough but are notably limited in range of motion compared to competitors’ controllers because of their short height. It’s easy enough to adjust to these tiny quirks, but even once I did, the Joy-Con never felt quite like home the way a great controller should. The other notable limitation of the Grip is that there’s no way to charge the Joy-Con while they’re attached – if their charge runs out (after what Nintendo claims is 20 hours, but we’ve yet to successfully run them down) you must re-attach them to the tablet to charge them. Alternatively, you can buy the $30 Joy-Con Charging Grip.   The Switch’s 6.2-inch, multi-touch, 720p LCD screen is a beauty. Color production is vibrant, and it’s bright enough to be played in indirect sunlight. Its generous viewing angles are a huge boon too, with a sweet spot large enough to make keeping an ideal picture easy. And even if you stray out of it, the picture remains visible in a roughly 120-degree arc – which is necessary when you’re playing multiplayer games in tabletop mode. Its touch functionality is leaps and bounds beyond the Wii U’s too, making it feel in line with the kinds of touch interfaces we’ve all grown accustomed to interacting with on iPads and Android tablets. There are areas where I could tell Nintendo had to make compromises to hit that $299.99 price tag, but the screen wasn’t one of them.   Apparently, the left Joy-Con is an area where Nintendo could’ve spent a little more. I’m not the only person experiencing de-syncs with it relatively often when playing with the Joy-Con detached (in or out of the Joy-Con Grip), leaving inputs temporarily unread until it reconnects a few seconds later. I’ve seen it happen occasionally with The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Link died more than a few senseless deaths this way – but more often when playing 1-2-Switch, which has several mini-games that require you to cover most of the Joy-Con with your hand, potentially interfering with its signal.  I even had this problem playing from the Joy-Con Grip a mere 10 feet away from the Switch console, forcing me to scooch up further on my bed in order to maintain a reliable connection. Distance appears to be a factor. I didn’t have any problems when I played the system in handheld mode with the Joy-Con docked directly to the hardware, though. In fact, for a variety of reasons, this became my preferred way to play (more on that later). Individually, each Joy-Con can be turned sideways to be used as a simple controller. But their tiny size and awkward layout have to be fought against even when playing the most basic of games, like Super Bomberman R. Attaching the included wrist straps to them extrudes the shoulder buttons, making them a bit easier to hit, but they still require too much pressure to hit comfortably. Also, the left and right Joy-Con aren’t symmetrical. One has the buttons awkwardly pushed towards the center, while the other does the same to the analog stick instead, which means neither are in any way ideal to use. The Joy-Con controllers are packed with some nifty extra features that a creative developer might put to good use, though. Their motion-tracking accelerometers are highly accurate and responsive, which can be seen in games like 1-2-Switch, where you’re making precise movements like rotating slowly to pick locks. And the Ball Count mini-game made me a believer in what Nintendo calls HD Rumble, a form of articulated haptic feedback that actually did a great job of fooling me into perceiving weight and motion within my Joy-Con. The right one even has an infrared sensor that could eventually be used in interesting ways, and an NFC reader for scanning amiibo, which is already being put to good use.   At the time of this writing, Nintendo has still not officially confirmed any exact specifications of the internals, but we now know that a custom version of the Nvidia Tegra X1 chipset powers the Switch. It’s a powerhouse by mobile standards, but it lacks the horsepower necessary to credibly compete with the now three-year-old PS4 and Xbox One. In fact, it’s hard to judge just how much of an upgrade it is over the four-year-old Wii U, based on specs alone. With 4GB, the Switch sports double the RAM of its predecessor (half of the PS4’s 8GB), but in terms of GPU and CPU clock speed, the numbers are surprisingly close, and not always in the Switch’s favor. The Switch’s premier launch game bears out this problem.  The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, which was developed simultaneously for the Switch and the four-year-old Wii U, seldom quite makes it all the way to 30 frames per second in TV mode, and it even dips far south of that when lots of particles or physics objects are on screen at once. That it suffers from these performance issues despite a lack of anti-aliasing does not bode well for the system’s long-term capabilities – or its prospects for landing ports of big-budget AAA games. These performance issues do not bode well for the system’s long-term capabilities.  Such performance issues would be somewhat understandable if Zelda was sporting gorgeous, high-resolution textures, but that doesn’t seem to be the case. Despite its massive, sprawling open world, Zelda is housed in a tiny 13.4GB file, and on a big 1080p screen it becomes fairly obvious that many of the textures have been heavily compressed. We can’t be certain if that’s a consequence of larger game cards being more expensive for Nintendo to manufacture or of limited RAM on the Switch, but regardless of the cause, the symptoms are noticeable. The art style hides it well in Zelda’s case, but this may be a concern going forward, especially for potential multi-platform ports.
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	 Fast RMX is a blazingly-fast, slickly-presented anti-gravity racer that borrows heavily from the classic Wipeout and F-Zero games. It never reaches the heights achieved by either of those seminal series, but its central phase-swapping mechanic helps give it a point of difference. Before we go any further, however, it’s important to point out that Fast RMX is essentially an expanded version (or, RMX) of the well-received Wii U racer Fast Racing Neo. Developer Shin’en Multimedia has included that game’s 16 base tracks and the eight added tracks from its DLC, and then introduced six more for a total of 30 courses. Elsewhere, it builds upon the same set of vehicles, the same three “leagues” – or speed classes – and the same set of modes. There’s one notable exception: time trial was not included at launch.   It may be an anti-gravity racer, but Fast RMX hits the ground running. It explains little out of the gate, its AI is competitive, and its starting speed class is quite fast – particularly next to its even earlier forebear, Fast Racing League (a 2011 WiiWare release). That said, there are no weapons, so the focus is entirely on racing and making the most of the two boost systems. The series’ signature mechanic is the ability to phase shift your vehicle between blue and orange states to hit the colour-coded boost zones on the courses themselves.  The series’ signature mechanic is the ability to phase shift your vehicle between blue and orange states to hit the colour-coded boost zones on the courses themselves. It’s a simple, clever idea that adds another wrinkle to racing and track knowledge, but stops well short of an Ikaruga-like implementation. Instead, you’ll hit boost strips, you’ll soar through alternating zones that require quick switching, and you’ll vault from coloured jump pads. Mastering each course is all about finding the best racing line to both hit these boost zones and to pick up the many energy orbs. The latter top off your energy meter, letting you manually boost to maintain your top speed between boost zones, or quickly get back up to speed if you crash or get hit by another racer. Fast RMX’s Championship mode isn’t ideally structured. Instead of steadily unlocking the complete set of 30 courses as you progress through the speed classes, you actually get to race on all of them from the first class – Subsonic. While freedom is usually a good thing, I found that I wanted more of an incentive to persist with the Championship beyond testing my skills and unlocking courses for Hero mode. Moving from one speed class to another isn’t quite the jump you might expect, either. As I mentioned, Subsonic is actually quite fast, so moving to Supersonic is really an incremental step. That’s fine, but it’s in contrast to a series like Wipeout, where the jump is so significant that you basically need to learn new racing lines for each course. It also means the course design can’t scale. Having some courses that only exist in the top speed class allows for a different style of design, as they don’t need to remain fun at slower speeds. The weather effects are generally excellent. To their credit, the 30 available courses are impressively varied in terms of settings. You’ll blast through deserts under the baking sun and whip through lush tropical jungles against the driving rain. You’ll visit futuristic metropolises and ancient civilisations. You’ll race on swooping structures suspended high in the sky and you’ll dodge asteroids in space. Each is distinct in terms of architecture and tone, and there are always incidental details to appreciate, whether that’s environmental effects like racing in and out of clouds or more overt inclusions like the course where a gigantic sandworm erupts from the side of the track and rumbles overhead. Sadly, the soundtrack – a vital component of any anti-grav racer – is largely indistinct. On a technical level Fast RMX runs at 60 frames per second across single and splitscreen (with the odd hiccup that I’ve noticed), and the native resolution tops out at 1080p, as opposed to Fast Racing Neo’s 720p. The lighting and effects on the returning courses have also been improved noticeably over the Wii U’s version, too.   The actual course design is a mixed bag, however. Iceland, for instance, channels F-Zero X’s Big Blue, seeing you racing along the outside of a tubular track, able to move all the way around its surface. The coolness of the setting is soured somewhat by the stalking robots, pylons, and walls that litter the track and can be almost impossible to avoid at speed. These kinds of obstacles are present in many of the courses, and while some are fair - spinning turbines you can see from a distance, or pylons in fixed places, others are far more random, and thus, less fun. Fast RMX also has its fair share of jumps that’ll send you careening into scenery if taken at the wrong speed. The course design often feels clumsy, as opposed to skill testing. In Hero mode, your boost energy is also your shield energy… and you must come in first – there’s no prize for second place.  None of these points are deal breakers, they’re just a bit irritating given how competitive the AI is, and given you only have one shot at each course within each Championship cup. The lack of a time trial mode compounds this, as you can’t go in and practice a course that’s giving you problems. The developer has said the mode will come in an update, but as it stands, time trial functionality like ghost races is sorely missed. Hard-edged design elements are even more of a problem in Hero mode, in which you race individual courses and have only one life, so a single mistake and you’re starting the whole race again. That said, this mode offers a pretty compelling alternative to Championship. In Hero mode, your boost energy is also your shield energy, so every course becomes a test of using enough boost to stay in contention, without y'know, blowing yourself up. Oh, and you must come in first – there’s no prize for second place. Hero mode also has all 30 courses across all three speed classes, but you’re actually racing mirrored versions of the tracks. Given that this is supposed to test your expertise in each course, I’d have thought having the regular versions would make more sense, with mirrored unlocks at the end of both the Championship and Hero mode as a bonus. Fast RMX certainly isn't short on atmosphere. Fast RMX also has a suite of multiplayer options, but as of this review’s publish date, this is its weakest component. Online multiplayer currently has no lobby system. Instead, you choose your vehicle then are thrown in with a random group of people. When a race ends everyone votes for the course they’d like to do next, and that’s it. No championships, no way to choose speed class, and no friend functionality. The latter is due to be patched in soon. Splitscreen multiplayer, on the other hand, fares a lot better. It supports up to four players, but gives you plenty of options to work with. You can choose individual tracks or race through a cup, you can turn CPU drivers on and off, you can choose your speed class, and you can set lap count. Local online multiplayer is also available, but each player needs to own a copy of the game. Fast RMX may not be the perfect anti-gravity racing package, but it certainly offers high-speed racing and a lot of tracks to challenge yourself on. It’s a shame that the online multiplayer offering is so barebones, and that the time trial mode is currently AWOL, but in lieu of an official Wipeout or F-Zero this is a solid option to get your arcade racing fix on the Nintendo Switch.
Mike Rougeau	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	 Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove is a comprehensive Shovel Knight collection that does a good job of showing off what’s great about the Nintendo Switch, while the new Specter of Torment expansion unearths new depth. These exceptional retro-looking (and sounding!) platformers have previously been released on so many platforms that you’ve probably played Shovel Knight already in one form or another (and if you haven’t, you should – see our original Shovel Knight review), but Specter of Torment, in particular, is well worth returning for. For one thing, the full bundle – called Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove – is a great peek into how far an indie studio can come in just a few years. The original Shovel Knight is a small but polished 2D action game with great platforming, an arsenal of varied tools, and a surprisingly well-written story. And while Plague of Shadows feels like a remixed addition for hardcore fans, Specter of Torment feels like a completely new game, and one that shows off everything Yacht Club has learned since the original’s release in 2014.  The Switch version has a ton of features that are either new or will be new to many of those who haven’t played Shovel Knight since it first came out. The base game (Shovel of Hope) has co-op now, for example, made even better by the Switch’s multiplayer-friendly Joy-Con controllers (although it’s overall better with the more precise Switch Pro Controller and its actual D-pad) and the system’s general portability. There are amiibo features too – you can personalize a custom knight and easily bring it to a friend’s system for co-op, or if you have a custom knight saved from a previous Nintendo platform you can import it with a tap. New to this iteration is the Fairy of Shovelry, a small sprite amiibo owners can summon to zip around the screen while you play. The fairy isn’t useful, as it mimes picking up treasure and fighting enemies without having any actual effect. But it is cute.  Treasure Trove also has the new “body swap” feature, which lets you fiddle with the gender and identifying pronouns (he/she etc.) for every main character. Making all the knights female and the Enchantress male – turning her into the Enchanter – is a nice way to make Shovel Knight feel fresh again, and you can tune the story to your liking. Unfortunately, body swap is currently only available in the original game, Shovel of Hope, though it’s reasonable to hope the developers might add it to the expansions in a future update.  The real draw for returning players is Specter of Torment. The real draw for returning players is going to be the brand-new expansion, Specter of Torment. It adds so much to the overall package, more than simply a set of new story missions. Take the new challenge accessible from Specter Knight’s hub world -- a tower that stretches into the heavens and begs to be climbed. An empty suit of armor named Horace guards the entrance to its constantly rearranging heights. He challenges you to reach the top, a feat that can only be accomplished with lightning-fast reflexes and precise platforming. It’s not the most difficult area in Treasure Trove, but its balance of challenge and replayability makes it great. Then there’s the campaign, which stands easily on its own. A prequel story, this adventure follows Specter Knight on his quest to convince the other knights to join the Enchantress’s Order of No Quarter. With that description, you’d think it would retread the same territory the original and Plague of Shadows did, but Specter breaks a surprising amount of new ground and packs in a lot of brand-new content. It took me over seven hours to get through Specter’s story and beat Horace’s tower, and that time didn’t even count any of the new challenges (which include more alternate boss fights) or the new game plus mode you unlock after beating the story.  Specter Knight's abilities create new opportunities for platforming challenges. Like Plague Knight before him, Specter Knight gets a huge pool of unique abilities and attacks to play with. He can run up some walls and surf or grind along fast-moving rails, creating new opportunities for platforming challenges. While in the air his attacks cause him to zip toward enemies, and whether he hurtles toward the ground or flies upward depends entirely on your angle and timing. This definitely takes getting used to, and even several hours in you might get flustered by the number of jumps you flub. Frustration can, unfortunately, mount, especially on more difficult levels, although with no overworld map you can tackle each mission in whatever order you choose, so it’s easy to walk away from a problem and come back later when you’re not as angry.  Even so, Specter Knight marks a big improvement over Plague Knight’s arsenal in Plague of Shadows. Although it’s rewarding to tinker with Plague’s bombs to try to make the perfect tool for each new situation, controlling the alchemist through double-jumps and explosion bursts feels awkward and imprecise. In comparison, Specter Knight feels totally fluid and skill-based, bringing to mind old Castlevania classics.  Specter Knight feels totally fluid and skill-based. It wouldn’t be Shovel Knight without a slew of cool extra upgrades and abilities, and Specter Knight delivers. One of Specter’s alternate cloaks lets him scythe-grind on any surface, including spikes, while another grants him recharging “darkness” (power for using abilities) when you destroy the checkpoint orbs throughout a level, which puts you at risk of losing a lot of progress should you die. Meanwhile Specter’s unlockable “curios” include powerful moves that let you float through the air, pass through walls to attack enemies all over the screen, and recharge your health on a whim. If playing as Plague Knight sometimes feels like hard mode due to the strangeness of that character’s movements, Specter Knight’s devastating attacks can make playing as him feel like cheating. It was in danger of feeling too easy until the later levels, which really ramped up the challenge to compensate.  One of the best surprises in Specter of Torment is that unlike in Plague of Shadows, which reused the same levels from the original Shovel Knight, the new expansion features almost a dozen completely redesigned or brand-new stages. Each takes advantage of Specter Knight’s versatile movement style and unique abilities in fun ways, including regular sections that require you to scythe-swipe between targets while barely ever touching the ground.  For Specter, the developers went all out. Specter’s hub world, where you go to chat with minions, buy armor upgrades, test out new abilities, and more, is also totally different from the village in past versions (unsurprisingly, Specter Knight feels more at home in the Enchantress’ fortress than among the cheery villagers). Plague of Shadows toyed with similar ideas by revealing Plague Knight’s secret lab under the village tavern, but for Specter, the developers went all out. And that’s consistent throughout the expansion.  Shovel Knight has always had a surprisingly deep and well-written story for a game in this old-school, pixelated tradition, and Specter of Torment takes it to new depths as Specter struggles to convince the other knights to join his cause – and faces off with each of them in turn. And like the new stages, each boss has been redesigned to better face off with Specter. Black Knight, for example, rides into battle on a spiked turtle/rhino thing named Terrorpin, and that’s just the first boss fight in the expansion. Each new ally joins the Order for a feast back in the hub area, and you can check in with them for funny dialogue and character moments in between missions. There are even flashback scenes that flesh out the ghostly Specter Knight’s backstory, showing his motivations are more complex than Plague Knight’s “more power!” and even Shovel Knight’s “save your friend!” Specter Knight’s motivation for spending hours trying to defeat Horace’s tower climb challenge, on the other hand, remains a mystery – unless you count my own obsession. This is the best version of Shovel Knight yet, and Treasure Trove is the most complete package. In addition to piling ever more new features on top of the original, Yacht Club has improved on Shovel Knight in nearly every way with the Specter of Torment expansion. From the story and writing to the simple fluidness of platforming and combat, Specter Knight is an excellent new step for the series.
Jonathon Dornbush	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	 The key to Snipperclips: Cut It Out Together! lies in cutting your own characters to pieces to fit whatever colorful, lighthearted challenges it throws at you. That idea, applied to a series of peculiar but engaging objectives, consistently leads to clever and oftentimes hilarious use of this puzzler’s central mechanic. And those objectives are well worth tackling alongside a group of friends. Offering two sets of puzzles — one for up to two players and another set for up to four — Snipperclips simply throws you into each problem in a refreshing way. The only information it provides is a name and the basics of its snipping mechanic — characters can overlap and cut away those parts of each other. Being given so little direction is actually freeing because it prompts you and whoever you’re playing with to think creatively. I found myself immediately exploring every level, testing the bouncy physics that cause items in the environment to react to whatever shapes you’ve created and occasionally messing with other players by cutting them to pieces before tackling the puzzler’s wide away of eclectic challenges.    No puzzle feels like there is a single correct solution. Experimentation is so rewarding because no puzzle, from matching a shape outline to helping a lone frog find its way to a friend, feels like there is a single correct method for solving it. Trying to get a baseball into a hoop? Maybe carefully carry it with your friend on your heads across the screen. Or, snip and clip a bowl-shaped indent onto your friend’s body to safely transport the ball. The Princess Power-Up minigame is a particular highlight — essentially a game within Snipperclips, you have to move an in-world joystick to control a princess who has to collect a series of diamonds. But, you must first cut the right path for her to walk, avoiding enemies along the way. I would take an entire expansion of these levels alone.   I played Snipperclips while waiting for a movie at a theater, during dinner at a diner, and at home on the couch. The bite-sized approach to puzzle design delivered Snipperclips delivers a consistently fun experience no matter the setting. , making good on the Switch’s promise to be a console for use at home and on the go. Adding up to three more people in co-op just means more creativity from the different perspectives, and thus more fun, especially with the puzzles designed for larger groups. Make a gear out of your friend, transport sludge via a ramp made from your character’s body, or pop balloons with another player’s head sharpened to a point. Every weird solution, or attempt at one, is a delight to work through in all of Snipperclips’ more than 60 puzzles.  And the bright, angular art design is easily understandable and a joy to play through, so it rarely left me or other players at all confused about how to proceed throughout those challenges. The player characters’ ridiculous facial expressions only add to the silly nature of your tasks, as they squint under the weight of every bowling or baseball or gasp in horror as their friends snip away at them.    Snipperclips is undoubtedly more fun when playing with others. Snipperclips is undoubtedly more fun when playing with others. Though just about everything can be completed alone, even the four-player challenges, taking the right steps to trap a firefly, catch some fish, or deliver a bird egg to its nest for hatching can often be more tedious than entertaining when snipping solo. And while later puzzles can get tough, most levels are forgiving, with reset buttons often included in each level and the ability to reform your character with a simple button press. Snipperclips’ control scheme is also simple and easy to grasp, so having two built-in controllers with the Joy-Cons makes for readymade pick-up-and-play opportunities. There are a few competitive options as well — air hockey, basketball, and a fighting dojo where whoever can snip their friends into oblivion first wins — but they’re more amusing diversions than modes worth revisiting time and again. All three are also particularly more fun with three players rather than two — the frenetic action becomes a bit of controlled chaos that is a blast in short bursts. But they don’t extend Snipperclips’ life too long after the handful of hours it takes to beat all of the puzzles. With a clever idea for 2D physics-based puzzle solving and a bright and colorful personality, Snipperclips: Cut it Out, Together! is a good experience by yourself and a great one with friends. Solving every puzzle won’t take too long, but Snipperclips is continuously clever in its puzzle design and adorably fun to watch play. It left me eagerly waiting to reunite more frogs, put together more cat puzzles, and solve whatever other odd challenges developer SFB Games might have in mind.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	 On paper, Nintendo Switch should be an ideal platform for Super Bomberman R: it can be played on a big television or portably, it supports up to four players on one Switch (if you have extra controllers) or up to eight online, and it seems to stick to the classic Bomberman formula (sorry, but I’ll never not have nightmares about Bomberman: Act Zero). And while there’s plenty to like about Super Bomberman R, the Switch’s tiny tablet screen does not do the top-down, tiny Bomber avatar action any favors. And, at $50, it’s unreasonably expensive considering the amount of content when compared to past Bomberman games. If you’ve somehow never seen or played Bomberman, it couldn’t be much simpler: blow up the destructible parts of the battle arena in order to find hidden upgrades and use them to immolate your human or AI foes. But that simplicity is what helps make it a thrilling party game, whether you’re barely evading an enemy’s bomb blast or trapping a foe in a corner to get the round-winning kill.  Super Bomberman R puts forth a noble attempt at an actual plot in the 50-stage, few-hour Story mode, complete with anime-ish cutscenes. They aren’t particularly funny or interesting, but they’re easily skippable if you like. Boss fights every ninth and 10th round are the highlight, with some truly tough (and enormous) opponents standing between you and the next of the five worlds (plus a sixth world’s final boss fight). Jump-in-anytime co-op is a plus in this mode. The camera, however, does its best to frame the action by occasionally zooming in or out automatically, but gets annoying in the process because tracked enemies sometimes go out of frame or become obscured by the HUD. What Super Bomberman R absolutely gets right is multiplayer logistics. This 33rd-ever Bomberman game can be easily configured to play in a number of ways: solo (in the Story mode) on the tablet or TV, two players in Story co-op or Battle using the left and right Joy-Con, four players on one Switch tablet locally, eight on the TV locally, eight via four to eight wifi-enabled Switches in the same room, or up to eight online. That’s awesome, and the Joy-Con are a good match for Bomberman’s classic one-button gameplay – which, by the way, remains as simplistic and fun as ever. I did encounter a bit of lag in the couple online matches I could find, however.  Less awesome is multiplayer depth. Classic Bomberman rules are in effect here, but not much else. You only get eight maps unless you unlock more variants using the cumbersome in-game credits system, and round customization could be a lot deeper, as it has been in past Bomberman games like Bomberman Live. There, you could turn every power-up on or off individually to really tweak battles to your exact preference. Super Bomberman R’s multiplayer versatility and boss-filled story mode are laudable retreads of classic gameplay, but its depth and customizability are disappointing. By contrast, the aforementioned Bomberman Live was a brilliant, fully featured Bomberman for Xbox 360 that came out 10 years ago, and it only cost $10. It’s reasonable to expect a bit more from a $50 Bomberman game in 2017.
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	 1-2-Switch is a totally bizarre party game that made me laugh much harder than similar collections like Wario Ware or Mario Party, but I’m still not sure if I was laughing at it or with it. The assortment of 28 diverse mini-games seems to exist to show off the fidelity of the sensors on the Joy-Con controllers, and they do, but the remarkably unique games lack any real depth. The weirdness starts at the very beginning. Each individual game is introduced with a fairly well-produced live-action trailer-slash-tutorial that gives you an idea of the overall tone and mechanics. They’re color coordinated and neatly cut, but seem to be advertisements for the individual game modes more than helpful tutorials. Some are really bad at communicating what you’re supposed to do, and as a result a lot of your first play sessions will probably involve a whole lot of people saying ‘wait, what am I supposed to do here?’   Even when you do have an understanding of how different games work, some, like the baseball mini-game, are confusing. You know one of you has to bat and one of you has to pitch, but it doesn’t tell you what sounds to listen for to swing and hit the virtual ball at the right time, plus you can actually get caught out, which seems like it might happen at random. When you’re the batter, a virtual player on a non-existent field can ‘catch’ the ball you hit, and I was never able to tell the physical difference between a successful swing and a losing one. It never communicated that with me.  Baby is one of the most off-putting mini-games I've ever played.  Other games like Gorilla, Baby, and Zen serve very little appeal beyond the novelty of how odd they are. Gorilla has you pound your chest to a simple beat - something you could do without a Joy-Con if you really wanted – but you probably don’t. Baby has you take the console out of the dock and hold it like a baby, rocking it slowly until it stops crying, and then setting it down without waking it up. And it does seem to genuinely be the audio of a baby crying, which automatically makes it one of the most off-putting mini-games I think I’ve ever played. Zen has you sit perfectly still or hold a particular pose, or just put the Joy-Con down - the Switch largely can’t tell the difference.  There’s a big issue with audio-based games in a party setting, too: they become unplayable if there’s too much background noise. One of my favorite games has you move the controller up, down, left, and right if the in-built female voice commands it, but you have to do the opposite if the male voice says it. That game is, in the right setting, competitive and fun, but it’s odd to have a party game you can’t play at an actual party where people are talking or listening to music.   And yet, the things that do work make people laugh much more than most. Even after four hours experiencing all of 1-2-Switch’s absurdities with a small group I didn’t feel bored of the selection of games, and I easily could’ve added a few more hours of playing the simple reflex contest of Quick Draw on top of that.  It offers an oddly personal competitive experience.  Even if it’s laughter at the expense of someone chomping on absolutely nothing just for the Joy-Con to pick up how many virtual sandwiches they’ve eaten, 1-2-Switch offers an oddly personal competitive experience that’s tailored to your own social setting. At some point during our Switch party, we figured out that making a B sound while opening and closing your mouth seems to help you move faster, which resulted in a room full of people trying it out and trying to beat the previous person’s score, all the while making totally ridiculous “bababababa” sounds. We laughed so, so hard at Milk - the game where you milk a virtual cow - and the unnatural, frankly overtly sexual motions it forces you into, all the while encouraging increasingly awkward eye contact between the two players. Beyond humor, there’s also a degree of wonderment in discovering exactly how the hardware works. Ball Count still seems like magic to me, in that it has you count the amount of small virtual balls that are present in the Joy-Con based on simulation through precise vibration and sound. It’s an interesting demonstration of the Switch’s “high-definition haptics” technology and it’s worth trying once or twice, but I don’t think a whole lot of people will repeatedly come back to it. It’s more gimmicky than anything, because when you think about it it’s literally just simulating marbles in a box.   There are a few different modes, too, including a shuffle mode that plays different games at random and a virtual board game that increases the usual number of players by encouraging you to split up into teams and pass the controllers around. In that, it’s inclusive and adaptable, and I think even people who’ve never played a game before could become wholly comfortable with 1-2-Switch in a matter of hours. That said, I think this is a game you show to people once, when you’re trying to introduce them to the Switch, and then probably never again. It’s fun, and I’ve repeatedly seen it entertain a room full of people who might not even be playing, but the novelty quickly wears off, and I ultimately think it should've been included in a bundle for free. 1-2-Switch is the Switch’s version of Wii Sports, in that it acts as an overall mission statement for the console itself. The quirky, bizarre nature of the unique mini-games make it a funny, memorable experience, but some games are hard to play at first due to unclear tutorials and dialogue cues.  Despite its oddities and flaws, I have had so, so much fun playing and watching 1-2-Switch with a small group of friends that I can recommend it in that specific situation, but I don’t have much desire to go back.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	 The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild’s sheer freedom and sense of adventure is a remarkable achievement. Right from the start, the vast landscape of Hyrule is thrown completely open to you, and it constantly finds ways to pique your curiosity with mysterious landmarks, complex hidden puzzles, and enemy camps to raid for treasure and weapons. The fact that you can tackle any one of these things at your own pace and almost never get pulled to the main path is liberating, but the way all of Breath of the Wild’s systems fit elegantly into complex light survival game is even more impressive. I’ve been running around for over 50 hours and I still have plenty of mysteries left to track down and lots of wonderfully crafted puzzles to solve. I’m in awe of the scope and scale of this adventure, and I often find myself counting the hours until I can get back in. The untamed, post-apocalyptic, techno-fantasy land of Hyrule is the main character in Breath of the Wild. Not only is it vast, beautiful, and filled with a diverse set of locations from grassy fields to craggy alpine mountains, but it follows surprisingly realistic rules that let you pull off solutions so intuitive that you might be surprised they actually work. The trees bear fruit, grass fields can be set ablaze, and even enemies and animals behave in a believable manner, based on the skittish and aggressive reactions I’ve seen in the wild. But the realistic touches don’t end there. Each object you encounter, from sticks to apples to rocks and metallic blocks, is made of a material, and those materials usually respond to forces like fire and magnetism as you’d expect.   It all sets up a surprisingly fun and responsive sandbox to interact with, and one I’ve rarely seen executed so well in an action-adventure game. If you think something should work, it usually does, and that led me to all kinds of fun and hilarious experimentation. You can stand under an apple tree with a torch and bake the fruit into a quick-healing snack before you even pick it, or drop a metal sword in front of a weaponless enemy and watch it get fried by a bolt of lighting. Meanwhile, Link needs warmer clothes to survive the cold and flame-resistant gear to near the volcanic Death Mountain. It’s consistently amazing to learn how all of these systems interact with each other while you play.    What elevates Breath of Wild above its contemporaries is its sheer freedom. But what elevates Breath of Wild above its open-world contemporaries is its sheer freedom, both in its non-linear questing structure and in your ability to climb almost any surface and travel in any direction once you leave the starting area. It is the heart of what makes this action-adventure game truly special and addictive. Like many open-world games it delivers on the implied promise that if you can see it out in the distance, chances are you can eventually reach it – but here, figuring out how to get there is more often than not a satisfying puzzle in itself, and one that never gets old. For instance, a tantalizing island far off the coast of the mainland was just out of my paragliding reach for the first several hours until after I’d upgraded my abilities. When I finally did, what took place when I finally reached my objective was a great twist that blew my mind – including finding an easier alternate route I’d missed. That paraglider is easily one of the most useful tools in Breath of the Wild because it's so versatile. You can use it to effortlessly glide across lakes and gaps or ride updrafts into new areas, and I often used each long trip across the map as a way to scan the marvelously lit horizon in search of clues or meditate on what I need to do next.  From overhead you get a glimpse of what’s even more evident from the ground: each individual area has its own little ecology, and systems built around extreme hot and cold temperatures and high altitudes mean you have to take the time to think and prepare in order to travel safely through them. It doesn’t matter, for example, if you can glide into the chilly mountains if you’ll freeze to death before you hit the ground. Going in with the right equipment makes all the difference.  As you continue to improve Link’s stamina meter and skills you can reach even more of these varied locations. But no matter how much stronger you get, the world and its resident Mother Nature is always more powerful than you will ever be. Random events like rain and thunderstorms slow down your movement across slick surfaces, and dangerous lightning bolts can strike with little warning if you’re wearing any metal. Additionally, the day/night cycle is constantly running, and makes meaningful differences: nighttime brings monsters that spring up from the ground, it's easier to spot some useful bugs and plants, and other secrets that are best discovered for yourself. These are all constant reminders that you are always at the mercy of the world itself.   Yet there are still pockets of serenity and beauty spread throughout the gorgeous, tantalizing landscape. In these moments, subtle music queues matched the tempo of my adventure, swaying between playful piano melodies and ambient sounds of wildlife. In the foreground, Breath of the Wild’s anime-inspired art style is colorful, remarkably lively, and beautifully animated, but it comes at the cost of brief framerate hiccups and object pop-in that’s most noticeable when you’re playing the Switch in TV mode, where it renders at 900p, and when there are a lot of physics particle effects flying around the screen. The issues are less frequent playing on in portable mode on the 720p screen, but regardless of where I played the performance problems never significantly soured my gameplay. Performance on the Wii U version is roughly the same as the Switch, although it's important to note it renders at 720p. This makes the jaggies a little more visible and lighting appear slightly different. Otherwise, it looks good on Wii U.    The light and flexible cooking system offers lots of opportunity to experiment. Unlike a lot of survival games in which every item you use must be created from felled trees and dug-up minerals, Breath of the Wild focuses all its crafting systems on cooking. It’s a light and flexible system that offers lots of opportunity for experimenting with different ingredient combinations to help you survive. Raw food and quick-and-dirty snacks cooked by a fire will replenish a small amount of health, but the most interesting and stat-boosting dishes come from tossing ingredients into a pot to make a hearty meal. I’ve spent many hours figuring out the best recipes by using clues noted in the ingredient descriptions to come up with effects like stamina boosts and elemental resistances of various potencies, and I loved that whenever I got a little carried away with the my recipes I ended up with a censored-out dish appropriately called Dubious Food that’s apparently too disgusting to even look at. Making buff-imbuing potions is equally as flexible, and you’ll find plenty of bugs and monster parts with which to mix up a special brew. Continues
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	 Even if I am Setsuna hadn't been sold to the public as a salve for Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6 fans pining for the golden age of the JRPG, its many similarities to those two classics would invite comparison. But instead of shamelessly aping those games, I Am Setsuna felt more like its own game the further I got into its deep magic and skills system, and the more I got to know its cast of intriguing characters. Some balance issues come dangerously close to trivializing its otherwise enjoyable combat, but it ultimately pulls through on the strength of its well-established tone and a well-told story. I Am Setsuna’s greatest strength, by far, is its steadfast commitment to the somber tone it establishes right from the outset. Yes, there are brief moments of levity, but nothing that qualifies as an attempt at comic relief, and the journey is all the better for it. This is a tragic tale of a fractured world filled with people who vainly struggle against a rising tide of danger, and nearly every creative choice properly reflects this. The gorgeous, achingly sad all-piano soundtrack, the muted colors, and the relentless emptiness of the overworld all work in harmonious service to the themes of sacrifice, regret, and hope in the face of cyclical and unending conflict.  The other edge of that sword is a sort of monotony that detracts ever so slightly from the overall sense of adventure. The overworld is just an endless expanse of snowy fields dotted with rickety old towns made up of a mere handful of homes, all of which look like they were furnished out of the same catalogue. And while the piano is no doubt a versatile instrument, that it is literally the only one employed does limit the music’s range of expression a bit. It works for what I Am Setsuna is - this certainly isn’t meant to be high fantasy - but I never felt a sense of anticipation of what might be waiting through the next cave entrance because I usually already knew.   What I was looking forward to, though, was finding out more about my traveling companions, whose tales are at a glance familiar: You are part of a group of adventurers whose main purpose is to help one special individual, the titular Setsuna, complete her journey to a far-off place. But I Am Setsuna betrays this well-worn trope in a number of interesting ways, not the least of which is the fact (revealed in the very beginning) that you are escorting Setsuna to her sacrificial death. You aren’t a bright-eyed young man looking for adventure, or even saving the world; you’re a heartless mercenary who’s escorting a young woman to her innevitable death.  In this world humankind scrapes by despite monsters of all kinds constantly hunting and killing them, and the only way to keep that threat somewhat at bay is to send an 18-year-old off to die. You aren’t a bright-eyed young man looking for adventure, or even saving the world; you’re a heartless mercenary who’s escorting a young woman to her death, just so what’s left of humanity can continue to huddle semi-safely in in their little shacks for a few more years.This pervasive sense of inevitable loss, as well as the feeling that humanity’s best days are already in the distant past, casts the actions and motivations of everyone involved in a unique light that keeps the story from feeling like the JRPGs it clearly borrows from. You will almost assuredly think you know these characters based on superficial similarities between them and characters from your favorite Final Fantasies of old, but none of this cast is what they seem. Don’t expect massive, mind-bending twists, but each of them has a story to tell, and I Am Setsuna does a great job of setting them up, developing them, and letting them have their moments without bogging things down with heavy exposition or 30-minute-long cutscenes. It never feels overly dour or self-indulgent either, which is something of a feat given how heavy the themes are.  Maybe it’s because most of the denizens of I Am Setsuna’s world have long since given up hope or struggle. Their resignation to their circumstances is part of what makes it such a heartbreaking tale, but it also lends a certain serenity to the proceedings. There is no melodrama here, just surrender to circumstance; as sad as that sounds, it makes every character’s personal struggle and their resolve to see Setsuna to her end all the more poignant.   Beneath its somber beauty are deep magic and skill systems which provide a wealth of options for party customization. Each character has their own distinct active skills, and a pool of passive skills can be assigned to anyone, but you have a limited number of ability slots to work with. Individual skills can be further altered with repeated use over time by a variety of bonus effects, and potential skill modifiers. I could end up with a provoke ability that heals me in addition to forcing monsters to attack me, or a fire spell that temporarily increases all of my stats. Add in the fact that characters don’t generally fit the traditional tank/healer/dps model of modern RPGs, and that specific characters have combination attacks together, and you have a ton of permutations at your disposal. Beneath its somber beauty are deep magic and skill systems which provide a wealth of options for party customization.  I Am Setsuna thankfully does a good job of rolling this stuff out slowly and in digestible bites. Its core might be ripped almost entirely from Chrono Trigger and Final Fantasy 6, but all these other elements really set it apart, ramping up the complexity considerably. The same goes for the combat, which employs a third resource to manage on top of mana and health, other new wrinkles in the form of timed button presses, and randomly occurring events called SIngularities which temporarily alter a variety of properties such as base character stats, elemental damage, and many more. All these systems work in tandem to provide a constant stream of interesting decisions to make, to a far greater degree than in the games I Am Setsuna walks in the footsteps of. I had a great time figuring out new, crafty combinations of party members and abilities to annihilate groups of enemies with. For as deep as this system goes though, it allowed me to amass a little too much power too easily. From an early point, I was able to identify skills that, with just a little tweaking, let me basically one-shot entire encounters. As long as I kept up with my gear (which is a disappointingly simplified series of straight-line upgrades) and kept making slight changes as needed, I was able to fly through fight after fight with just two or three different abilities. By sticking to these strategies, I blew through I Am Setsuna in around 20 hours, only dying once or twice on one particularly tough boss about two thirds of the way through the campaign. I kept waiting for my tactics to stop working so I’d have to rethink things and try new approaches, but they never did; even in the final areas I felt like I was on nothing more than a routine farming run. I kept waiting for my tactics to stop working so I’d have to rethink things and try new approaches, but they never did; even in the final areas I felt like I was on nothing more than a routine farming run.  Instead of balancing those abilities out by reducing their power or increasing enemy resistance, I Am Setsuna puts a Band-Aid on the problem in the form of a unique system that changes item drops based on the types of attacks you use to defeat an enemy. For instance, kill a monster with with a fire spell and you’ll receive one item; kill that same monster with lightning while they are under the effect of a debuff will net you something else entirely. This is meant to encourage build variety by incentivizing you to use other, less expedient tactics. Each monster has 12 different potential drops depending on how you slay them, and each of those drops is a vital component for unlocking new spells and abilities, so theoretically if you want to see all that your characters have to offer you need to experiment with different abilities. The turn-based battles are far more interesting when played with that in mind, forcing you to exhibit an understanding of I Am Setsuna’s thoughtfully interlocking gameplay systems. Sadly, all of that depth is undermined by the fact that you can power through with the basics, and there’s no way to pump up the difficulty either.   The only difference between the PS4 and Switch versions of I Am Setsuna is the frame rate. Despite having a visual style and level of fidelity usually associated with a PlayStation 2-era game, the Switch version runs at 30 fps, as opposed to the PS4 version’s 60. Though it doesn’t hamper the turn-based gameplay in any way, it is disappointing considering that the Switch’s hardware should be more than up to the task. A lack of balance robs the combat of much of its fun and renders many of the more interesting gameplay systems moot, but it didn’t dampen the emotional impact of I Am Setsuna’s heartfelt message for me. Few story-driven RPGs are so thematically focused or so gleefully disinterested with being “entertaining” or “fun.” To say it attempts to stand on the backs of giants is disingenuous really. I Am Setsuna isn’t a “Chrono Trigger-like;” it’s just a game that might easily have existed in the same time, if a creator with different storytelling sensibilities had been around. Its strength comes not from the ways in which it emulates the conventions of the classics, but in the ways in which it defies them.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/20/shantae-half-genie-hero-review	 Developer WayForward is pretty well dialed-in when it comes to the secret science of making a strong 2D platformer, and Shantae: Half-Genie Hero benefits greatly from that understanding. Shantae has a wide array of forms and magical abilities, and yet levels are designed to accommodate her talents in a surprising number of ways. And even if the gameplay weren’t as well-tuned as it is, then the toe-tapping soundtrack, plucky protagonist, and beautiful hand-drawn animation probably would have been enough to win me over anyway. Right from the start, Half-Genie Hero disarmed me with super-saturated colors and Saturday-morning-cartoon charm. Even ostensibly mundane stuff like the stage-select screen or running around town to talk to NPCs carries an air of unashamed, childlike fun and silliness. And Shantae herself is the force driving it all. Even when you put the controller down, she stands there bopping jovially to the beat of the music, and it's hard not to join in.  And I mean really hard. The music runs the gamut from high-energy action fare to down-tempo chill jams, but every track is rhythmic and highly danceable. Fortunately, there’s a button for that. Tapping the triangle button stops time so Shantae can get her groove on while you choose from an array of different animal forms to take. The monkey, for instance, can leap high into the air and cling to walls, while the mermaid gives Shantae full underwater mobility. After you’ve unlocked them, it’s like playing Super Mario Bros. 3 with unfettered access to every suit at all times. Each appreciably large, well-designed stage has hidden collectibles and enhancements to find, many of which are stuffed away in nooks and crannies you can’t reach until you get the appropriate animal form. It still feels more like a traditional action platformer than a full-blown Metroidvania, but there’s certainly no shortage of backtracking to do or power-ups to buy in town.  Since there’s no set order to when you buy or find different powerups, progression can sometimes feel a little muddled, both for Shantae’s power growth and in terms of advancing the story. You might need to go back and find a hidden area in a level you’ve already completed in order to find the item you need to complete story-critical objective in another area before unlocking the next level, for instance. You can drop into the bathhouse for a hint if you’re stumped, though, so it’s never more than a minor inconvenience. You could likely beat Shantae: Half-Genie Hero in a couple of sittings, but the platforming action is so varied, and the levels so explorable, it’s worth playing well beyond that. While it's neither innovative nor high-concept, its hand-drawn look and toe-tapping music successfully channel a joy and enthusiasm that has become far too rare in modern video games.
Terri Schwartz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	" Paper Mario takes a step in the right direction with the great-looking Color Splash, which continues the series’ trend of moving away from its RPG roots in favor of new gimmicks -- this time paint instead of stickers -- that add a unique twist to its turn-based combat. The gameplay has some much needed sprucing up after the ambitious but poorly executed Sticker Star on the 3DS, but the paper-thin story lacks the depth and resonance of some of Paper Mario’s earlier games, causing it to feel as two dimensional as its main character. Paper Mario: Color Splash's focus is all in its title; this take on the RPG-turned-action-adventure franchise sees Mario equipped with an endearing talking paint can sidekick, Huey, to bring color back to the paint-drained land of Prism Island and regain the six stolen (by Bowser, of course) Big Paint Stars. The inventive paint mechanics seep through the entire game: battles require item cards -- called Battle Cards -- to be powered up by colors, and completionists will feel compelled to fill in every colorless spot throughout the levels.  There's still the same quippy humor the series is known for, with some pointed meta-references to the Mario franchise and some literal potty humor that involves a roll of toilet paper, and Huey is a companion I found myself emotionally attached to by the end of the story to a degree that surprised me.   As someone who was disappointed with Sticker Star because of its subpar story and the way its lack of quantifiable experience failed to incentivize battles, Color Splash makes some much-needed tweaks that cause the many, many battles with grunt enemies feel like a worthy time investment. There's no traditional XP-based level system in Color Splash, but it does smartly implement an experience system where the more you battle, the more you can increase your paint storage. As you progress, you also earn upgrades that increase your health and how many cards you can hold.  Color Splash made some much-needed tweaks Because the turn-based fights are conducted with some cards that need to be powered up with paint -- and the more powerful the card, the more paint you need -- Color Splash becomes much easier once you can carry more paint. Because I battled the majority of enemies I encountered, I had quadrupled my paint storage within two hours of starting Color Splash and rarely found myself in a situation where a lack of paint prevented my progression. Color Splash isn't out to make paint, Battle Cards, coins, or health scarce. Despite the reliance on paint and Battle Cards for most of the gameplay, Color Splash finds an intuitive way to make those resources readily available. Pretty much everything in the courses, from trees to boxes to flowers, provides paint when whacked with Mario's hammer. Colorless spots around the levels beg to be filled in, and when you oblige them they produce coins and, more often than not, Battle Cards. The lower your health, the more likely hearts are to spawn as well. These are smart systems to balance the battles and paint demands, though Color Splash could have benefited from more than one card shop (at the main hub  of Port Prisma) and more readily available save blocks throughout the levels.  The Battle Card system isn't immediately intuitive. Color Splash primarily uses the Wii U gamepad for battles, though it also serves as a menu screen. Once a battle starts, the action shifts from the TV down to the gamepad, where you pick your attack from a deck of Battle Cards. It's a fairly convoluted process to actually queue up an attack: first you select the card you want, then you move it up from the deck to your hand, then fill it up with paint if it's not already, and then you flip it up to the TV to use in battle. Fortunately there's an “advanced controls” setting that streamlines the process and, ironically, makes the process simpler, but even so it's a system that takes a decent amount of time to get used to. Then there are Thing Cards, which are the natural progression from Thing Stickers and once again, they bring real-life 3D objects into the world of Paper Mario to allow you to overcome obstacles and defeat bosses. Things – like a plunger, a fire extinguisher, and lemons – are scattered throughout the courses and need to be ""squeezed"" to be transformed into cards. Do they necessarily make sense within the world of the game? Not really. Are their bizarre cutscenes when they’re played fun to watch regardless? Absolutely. The biggest flaw with the Thing Card system is the way they're integrated into boss battles as a win button. Using a boss’s corresponding Thing Card at the proper time is the only way to beat the majority of them, so without the correct card you have no chance and with it you're overpowered. There's no strategy involved; you either have the correct Things or you don’t.  There are other new mechanics, including a cut-out tool, which allows you to literally cut out portions of the screen to access seemingly impossible to reach areas, and ""Unfurl,"" which involves hitting a specially marked block and then a corresponding object to progress farther through the level. Each of these leans into the paper side of Paper Mario in new ways and varies the level design, though they ultimately don't add much beyond an imaginative new way to get from point A to point B.   Color Splash is by far the most beautiful game in the Paper Mario series, offering gorgeous textures that play into the three-dimensionality of the diorama-like paper world. There's rich detal in the crinkles at the edges of cardboard walls, and clever flourishes in the art direction, like having hedges made of puzzle pieces. But Color Splash offers up a simple, overly familiar story – one reminiscent of early Mario games – about little more than saving the princess, capturing the castle, and defeating the turtle-shelled bad guy. That speaks to the progression of the Paper Mario series away from the more story-driven RPG installments, toward the action-adventure-oriented Sticker Star. If fun gameplay is what you're looking for, Color Splash has it in droves; if you're looking for a memorable story in your Mario adventure, then you're likely to be let down. Color Splash offers up an overly familiar and simple story  The early levels follow a straightforward progression: you navigate through the course until you reach a boss at the end and recapture the Mini Paint Star. The majority of the levels require repeat playthroughs to find multiple Mini Paint Stars, some of which open up new areas and others which connect pre-existing ones -- ultimately, Color Splash wants you to find them all, which gets frustrating when you realize how often you need to retread old paths.  Things really pick up after you rescue the first two Big Paint Stars, though. Developer Intelligent Systems made the smart choice of switching up the level design in the second act to focus more on problem solving rather than simple battling and linear progression. These courses have more playful objectives, from finding ghost Toads in a haunted hotel and resolving their unfinished stories, to navigating a pirate ship through untrustworthy waters. One level even throws Mario into a retro course that's a blend of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Paper Mario, which was a definite highlight. This section shows the most ambition and offers a great amount of gameplay diversity. It was a joy to return to for repeat playthroughs -- something I found myself doing more often than not to find Thing Cards I missed and capture the multiple Mini Paint Stars in each level. They reinvigorated the campaign for me, which stretches into the 35+ hour range depending on how much of a completionist you are. When the third act reverts back to a more straightforward and streamlined level design, with the final battle being very linear, it’s a bit of a letdown. Paper Mario: Color Splash is a step in the right direction for the series after the 3DS’s Paper Mario: Sticker Star, continuing its shift from RPG to action-adventure game while also introducing some smart changes to its battle system. The beautiful Wii U graphics and playful humor stay true to the spirit of the Paper Mario franchise, but the story is straightforward and a bit bland. Inventive level design in the second act offers some much needed diversity to some of Color Splash's otherwise linear gameplay before the disappointing third act regresses into simple and uninteresting battles. Though Color Splash still isn't back to the high points of the first three games in the Paper Mario series, it's a strong step in the right direction."
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	 Imagine someone pouring pop rocks into a soda can, shaking it up as hard as they can, then digitizing the explosive results. That’s Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE: a zany, effervescent blend of beloved JRPG series Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei that lacks story depth but puts on a good show. Tokyo Mirage unapologetically embraces the goofier side of the Japanese entertainment industry by squeezing out every bit of silliness it can find and then dialing it up to 11. Throughout the nearly 60 hours of gameplay I was treated to a parade of razzle-dazzle vignettes that include flashy music videos, a snicker-inducing commercial where a girl rides a wave of nuclear-colored soda, and a goofy reenactment of a costume hero show. Usually all at once, since these over-the-top animations are part of Tokyo Mirage’s enormously fun combat.   Battles take place on a circular stage, where flamboyantly dressed teens call upon otherworldly beings known as Mirages to help them fight ghoulish versions of Fire Emblem enemies like Dark Clerics and Bloodwing Knights. On the surface, the combat mechanics are a straightforward mix of Fire Emblem’s rock-paper-scissors weapons triangle and Shin Megami Tensei spinoff Persona’s fusion system that lets you swap out upgradable skills and spells.That’s fine and dandy, but it’s hardly original. In fact, it’s not even the first time Persona’s combat mechanics have been crossbred with another franchise (check out my Persona Q review).  Each battle feels like a pop culture extravaganza. The secret ingredient to Tokyo Mirage’s success are the wacky combo attacks known as Sessions. Sessions are triggered by exploiting an enemy’s weakness to spells or weapon types, and can be strung together by learning passive skills that allow characters to do a follow-up attack based on the type of attack that preceded it. In other words, if the adorable ax-wielding Mamorin knows an ice-affiliated session skill, she can follow up grumpy Kiria’s ice spells with a flashy takedown of her own. This causes a chain reaction where any character with an ax-affiliated Session can jump into the fray. Every Session skill has its own unique character animation, so I never got tired of watching my heroes wail on enemies one after another after another.  Adding to the crazy shenanigans are randomly triggered buff attacks called Ad-Libs and  finishing moves called Special Performances, both of which come with plenty of visual flourishes. Combining all these special attacks makes each battle feel like a pop culture extravaganza, especially when a cheering audience showers you with extra loot every time you successfully pull off a flashy move. It’s all part of a deliberately in-your-face presentation, and I love it. More importantly, they come in handy against tough bosses like a trio of strange-looking creatures that will continuously revive themselves unless you manage to defeat them all in the same round.  Combat is fun, but the drawn-out exploration and arduous puzzle-solving that accompany it aren’t. Combat is fun, but unfortunately the drawn-out exploration and arduous puzzle-solving that accompany it aren’t as enjoyable. It’s not that flipping switches to move a giant mannequin’s arms or navigating LCD panels in the right order was too challenging, it’s that these environmental puzzles didn’t feel very original and require copious amounts of backtracking. What makes dungeons an even bigger slog is having to warp out of them at the halfway point just to watch a superfluous cutscene before resuming the story. (Seriously, does cheerful tomboy Ellie really need a change of venue just to advise sugary-sweet Tsubasa on how to act?) Even on the overworld map of Tokyo, the humorous character quests had me ping-ponging between areas separated by tedious loading screens just to fetch a donut or a doll. This stop-and-start approach to gameplay felt completely unnecessary and hurts Tokyo Mirage’s pacing.   I might have been able to overlook the constant interruption to gameplay if the story was a little more compelling, but the breezy plot about fledgling pop stars investigating supernatural events in Tokyo never evolves into anything meaningful. Even the happy-go-lucky cast feels a bit too generic – we’ve seen characters like the bland “everyman” Itsuki and the ditzy Tsubasa a million times before. I was also pretty bummed that the Fire Emblem cast felt so ancillary; Chrom and his fellow Mirages felt completely out of place in the bubblegum antics of the teens they’re sworn to protect. Luckily, these otherworldly allies serve more of a purpose on the battlefield. By turning into things like swords or axes, they can lend powerful weapon-based skills like the armor-shattering Diamond Crusher sword attack to their pop idol masters. I also like that you can use the Master Seals feature from Fire Emblem to change a Mirage’s class into a more powerful warrior type that can learn new skills and abilities. The roleplaying mechanics that allow you to strengthen and upgrade weapons using enemy and ally drops known as Performa are pretty standard RPG fare, but I enjoyed being able to graft different combat skills onto these beautifully designed battle instruments however I saw fit. In a lot of ways, Tokyo Mirage Sessions #FE is a lot like the industry it’s poking fun at: it’s colorful, loud, shallow, and entertaining. Even when it threatened to bore or frustrate me into quitting with pointless loading screens and weak puzzle solving, it always drew me back in with its dazzling combat and catchy music. The story and characters may not have a lot of depth or sophistication, but it has style and charm, and I’m a big fan of that.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	 It may be intended as a small counterpart to Star Fox Zero, but Star Fox Guard exceeds expectations by building a creative and intuitive action-tower defense game around the idea of manipulating your perspective. Nintendo uses constant misdirection from enemy invaders to build tension and poke holes in your best-laid plans.  Star Fox Guard’s retro-inspired graphics can look a little bland next to Nintendo’s colorful HD standards, but there’s a lot going on here. Varied enemies of all shapes and sizes will mess with your view of the action, forcing you to make tough decisions to counter attacking troops. Successfully foiling these invasions unlocks more powerful weapons and new skirmishes to play, which creates an addictive upgrade loop. The way Star Fox Guard splits all the information necessary to keep your base safe between the GamePad and the TV in an instinctive way is a notable part of its success. On the TV, you see an array of 12 video feeds from turret-mounted cameras which you carefully place inside your base, with one feed displayed large in the center. The GamePad displays a handy map that highlights each turret position along with motion-tracker data, so you can keep tabs on pesky invaders even when you’re looking down at the controller.  The two screens complement each other nicely, since the rules are clear from the start: Action always takes place on the TV screen, with the GamePad used as a vital tool to shift your focus between active turrets and fire on incoming targets. This isn’t a co-op game, at least in the sense that other players can’t pick up controllers to help you, but the two-screen setup works great in a room full of people. The frantic, high-stakes missions got everyone calling out enemy locations for me to react to. Star Fox Guard’s seven robot-blasting weapon types are standard fare for this genre, but each becomes essential to fight the robots you face in the 40-mission campaign. The standard turret cam felt like outdated technology once I got my hands on the Slow Cam, an awesome upgrade that bought precious extra seconds I needed to save my base from annihilation countless times. The Charge Cam’s powered-up blasts will kill surrounding robots in a cinch, and the Freeze Cam stops enemies in their tracks, making them sitting ducks to shoot and shatter with another gun.   You need them, because once the campaign ramps up in difficulty, Star Fox Guard packs devilishly clever robots into nail-biting enemy waves that constantly mess with your cameras. The 26 robot enemies are split into two distinct classes that showcase adorable personality quirks. Some of my favorites came from the Chaos class since their tactics focus on misdirection. The jamming signal from the Dishrupter, a walking radar dish that could easily be mistaken for a kid’s toy, scrambles video feeds and temporarily blinds you, and Pausemo is a nagging deceiver that latches onto a camera and loops fake footage to help enemies sneak in.  Combat-class bots are no slouches either. The speedy F.L.I. rides a rocket straight into the center of your base to deactivate the core, while others, like the Cloak-R, take a sneakier approach that often made me panic because it doesn’t show up on the GamePad radar. Meanwhile the Shieldtron hides behind a full-body shield that can withstand turret fire, making it a tough threat until you find a better angle to shoot from. Before every mission, Star Fox Guard gives you a count of Combat-cass enemies but keeps the other roles a secret, so I felt surprised as the action unfolded. The constant pressure made me labor over where I should place turrets before a level begins, and how to most effectively use my upgrades.   The main missions are mostly similar in structure – you simply have to survive until the waves of enemies are exhausted – but when you get into the dozens of optional side missions, Star Fox Guard takes this great formula one step further by adding allies to defend or limiting ammo, forcing you to make each shot count. My favorite missions caught me by surprise with fresh ideas like these.  Carefully planning the layout of your cameras can often set up desperate moments during the end of a skirmish, as you rush to use any turrets left standing in a last-ditch effort to keep the base up and running. These tense situations are the highlight of a good action-tower defense game. There’s a competitive side, too – as you progress through the campaign, you’re unlocking bots that can eventually be organized into your own personal squad to terrorize your friends’ bases. It’s part of an optional challenge mode, but since victories and losses in that mode factor into the upgrade system, it encouraged me to take a chance and see if I could string together some extra points. If your friends’ squads aren’t up to snuff, Star Fox Guard lets you tackle other robot squad from random players on the internet to keep you busy once you’re done with the main campaign. Star Fox Guard is a fun action-tower defense game about managing different perspectives to put out fires as you use your resources to grow an awesome arsenal of robot-busting turrets. Its graphics are plain considering Nintendo’s artistic pedigree, but it’s still an elegant little game that can get a whole room of friends working together.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	 Star Fox Zero resurrects a classic Nintendo 64 plane and tank action game and reimagines it in a faster and more furious incarnation for the Wii U. The best levels capture the feeling of a wild rollercoaster, often showcasing addictive combat scenarios that incentivized me to get on the ride again and again. But, in order to build up my piloting skills, I had to adapt to a demanding and unintuitive control scheme that pushed my ability to focus on the TV and the GamePad to the limit.  This radically redesigned Star Fox pays homage to its vintage late ‘90s source material, but the results of the modernization are mixed. On one hand, this is a faster-paced space combat game running at a high frame rate (a “target” of 60) and it tries out some fun new level ideas. However, it takes the retro look a little too far in places, with a lot of plain-looking enemy ships and tall tanks made of simple geometry and dull textures that looks out of place in an otherwise-modern 2016 game. Yet even without elaborate graphics, the frame rate dips noticeably under the weight of large explosion effects in a couple of bigger combat arenas. Overall, Star Fox Zero pulls it off, and part of that is thanks to the inherent charm from its zany cast of fly boys and their intentionally cheesy banter during the campaign. It taps into these one-note personality tropes with plenty of quips and one-liners that would please a writers’ room of Saturday-morning cartoon producers, complete with plenty of “I’ll get you next time!” threats from villains. Zero’s story is a predictable re-tread of the N64 original, but it does a good job of refreshing it for a new audience.   The campaign can be completed in roughly five hours, but you won’t see everything on your first pass, and it does a lot to encourage more playthroughs so you can collect hidden medals and post high scores on the leaderboard. For example, some excellent skirmishes offer lots of targets to shoot, but if you keep your cool you’ll spot clever side exits that lead to entirely new areas. These hidden pathways crisscross through the galaxy, opening up challenging new courses featuring powered-up enemies or massive alternate bosses that must be defeated before a timer runs out. Carefully prodding and poking stages for secrets is the only way to unlock all 20 campaign missions.  Others levels in Star Fox Zero pull off impressive scale and spectacle. The hyperspeed trek through the Gamma Sector is a delightful trip through a tight spaces and deadly obstacles, while the tumultuous trek through the desert planet of Titania is full of falling debris and loaded with enemy ships to shoot down with the firepower of an awesome tank at your disposal. The one lame trip in my tour through the galaxy was Zoness, a plodding stealth level that felt more like busywork than an action-packed Disneyland attraction. In it, I had to man a frustratingly slow craft and deploy a personable-yet-dull robot companion to deactivate enemy defenses. Zoness squanders a lot of its potential with uninspired design, which often sees enemies conveniently patrolling around explosives or other hazards that made them trivial to destroy. It just doesn’t come together as well as Star Fox Zero’s rocket-fueled missions through livelier planets of the Lylat System. Big boss battles are Star Fox Zero’s best moments, and each one feels different. From air-to-air dogfights with the rival pilots of Star Wolf to a nasty face off with Monarch Dodora, an enormous winged boss that shoots a powerful laser from its tail, each fight focuses on using crucial maneuvers like flips to get behind enemies, barrell rolls (do one!) to avoid incoming projectiles, or blowing up pieces of a boss to expose its main weak point.  There’s some extra variety that comes from piloting a handful of different vehicles in certain missions, and Nintendo does a good job of making each craft feel unique, for better or worse. The Arwing quickly became my favorite because it can maneuver quickly in air-to-air combat, and while it’s clunkier and not quite as fun when it transforms into bipedal tank mode, it’s still much more enjoyable than the annoying and slow-as-molasses Gyrowing hovercraft. The Landmaster tank is another slow-moving vehicle, but it makes up for it with sheer, satisfying firepower that can take down enemies quickly. Collecting medals opens up difficult challenge missions for each vehicle so I could put my expert skills to the test, but you’ll have to stick with a frustrating learning curve to become an ace pilot at these controls.   What’s baffling about Star Fox Zero is that piloting a vehicle is complex and awkward at times because Nintendo chose to split our view of the action across two screens. The TV shows a traditional third-person perspective so you can see the space behind your ship, while the GamePad displays a transparent cockpit view that you use to aim at enemies using motions controls. I eventually did get good at it, but the learning process made my first hours more frustrating than they should’ve been. I often ran right smack into enemies and walls since it was hard to focus on moving and shooting at the same time. The problem comes when trying to maintain control as you move your eyes between the two screens, especially since the perspectives affect how you aim. Even through the TV shows a larger field of view, sometimes using it to take an unassisted shot that looks like it should hit will completely miss. In those cases, you have to look down at the GamePad to line up a precise volley, then look back up to take in your surroundings and push forward.  The good news is that the GamePad’s tilt controls feel competent no matter what vehicle you’re in, and it was easy to manipulate the cursor and fire at targets. Nintendo also gives pilots lots of alternate input options that alleviate some of the stress of driving: you can choose between using the analog sticks or buttons to pull off somersaults, quick 180- degree turn, or fire smart bombs. It feels like a job made for two people, and co-op mode appropriately splits up the two screens into two roles. This is the best way to play, since one person assumes the role of a pilot while a friend mans the guns. But the lock-on camera introduces a problem on the first boss: Because the perspective is stuck in a fixed perspective, the pilot can’t see directly in front of him without access to the view on the GamePad, and that’s kind of important! It’s difficult to pick up rings, or fly in general. Star Fox Zero’s fun stages and impressive boss fight give me lot of reasons to jump back in and play them over and over, and especially enjoyed them in co-op until I got a hang of juggling two screens myself. I’ve played 15 hours and I still haven’t found everything. Learning to use the unintuitive controls is a difficult barrier to entry, though it comes with a payoff if you can stick with it.
Darry Huskey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/15/pokken-tournament-review	 Pokkén Tournament is molded from familiar elements borrowed from a slew of old favorites. It endeavors to please fans of its namesakes - Pokémon and Tekken - while also appealing to fighting genre enthusiasts by incorporating bits of Street Fighter, Marvel vs. Capcom, and even Bandai Namco’s Naruto and Dragonball games. Its broad range of influences creates a wholly unique experience. The most notable innovation in this genre hybrid is the shifting field of battle. Pokémon battles transition back and forth between Field Phase - a three-dimensional scramble heavy on projectiles and positioning - and the more traditional fighting game-style Duel Phase, depending on your actions. A stiff blow in Field Phase activates Duel Phase, allowing access to bursts of damage. Completing a lethal combo in Duel Phase might shift the action back to Field Phase, where Pokémon can side-step and dodge arrays of laser beams and torrents of fire. This shifting helps layer strategy onto the frantic action, giving you pause to consider your next attacks and the way they will manipulate the flow of the battle.   Each of these turn-based RPG fighters is translated into a real-time combatant with mechanics that feel appropriate. Iconic Pokémon from both early and current generations are present and available to be pitted against each other, and as a long-time fan, I felt immediately welcome. The roster contains a nice mixture of old mainstays and new faces, and while it would be impossible to include everyone’s favorites, the 16-character group is made up of characters spanning Pokémon’s 20 years of history. These are characters that have existed for decades, and Pokkén Tournament does not disappoint in portraying them faithfully. Each of these turn-based RPG fighters is translated into a real-time combatant with mechanics that feel appropriate for their well-known designs. Machamp, for instance, stomps towards his foes, seeking to get close and dole out staggering blows or grab defensive opponents for even more damage. Gengar manufactures mix-ups with use of misdirection, forcing opponents to guess whether he will attack from above, from behind, or from below.   The art style feels right at home in the Pokémon universe, while also lending an edge to the visuals to make the action a good fit for a brawler. The sounds and music fit just as well as the graphics, with new takes on Pokémon soundtrack classics alongside original high-energy compositions. Pokémon games have always had quality music, and developer Bandai Namco has made sure that Pokkén Tournament does not tarnish that legacy.   The sheer breadth of complexity in gameplay places heavy expectations on your shoulders. Having sung those praises, I have to pivot and argue that Pokkén Tournament’s many strengths also serve as its biggest flaw. The sheer breadth of complexity in gameplay places heavy expectations on your shoulders: absorb a lot, and to do it quickly. Loading Pokkén Tournament’s Tutorial modes immediately illustrates this tsunami of ideas, as several non-interactive demos instruct you on a multitude of topics ranging from actions specific to Pokkén Tournament to advanced fighting game concepts. A narrated guide instructs new arrivals on Phase Shifts, Synergy Gauge, Support Gauge, Wall Combos, Wall Burst, Cancels, and Guard Breaks – by the end of it I felt like I'd just sat through a school lecture. Even for those of us experienced with fighting games, it can take some time to get comfortable with Pokkén Tournament’s plethora of mechanics.   To its credit, Pokkén Tournament’s single-player content seems to anticipate how overwhelming it might be fore new players and heads that off at the pass by featuring modes that help ease them into the action. Leagues of CPU-controlled Pokémon trainers can be challenged, feeding into promotion matches that grant access to leagues populated by more skilled trainers. This is a smart approach, as it gradually introduces Pokkén Tournament’s slew of advanced techniques via a series of opponents who become progressively more adept as you do, featuring AI that starts out feeble but quickly becomes formidable. And the final boss, who shall remain anonymous, is a great new take on an old idea.  It's successful: after spending a few hours playing single-player modes, I found myself becoming comfortable with its more advanced techniques. However, even for a fighting game, Pokkén Tournament can be surprisingly complicated. Even armed with knowledge and practice from hundreds of battles in single-player Leagues and training modes, I found myself sometimes overwhelmed managing the multitude of ways to optimize my Pokémon. Once you’ve mastered the basics and learned more of the unique traits of your character, you can quickly jump into netplay against other trainers. Pre-release online multiplayer had little in the way of latency, and even with a low population of players at the time of this review, matches were made quickly. Netplay features two modes, Friendly and Ranked Matches, and they are similar to the Casual and Ranked modes players have become familiar with in games like Street Fighter V. Being able to jump into my next battle with minimal waiting was a refreshing change of pace from recent fighting games. Pokkén Tournament takes a lot of what we know from old fighting gaming favorites and sticks them into a blender, delivering a unique take on both Pokémon and on fighting games in general. Sometimes all those ingredients spill over a container that’s a little too full - there is a surprising amount to learn beyond the beginner’s level, and that may alienate some Pokémon fans without fighting game experience. Pokkén Tournament does do a good job, though, at alleviating this bloat of mechanics with single-player modes to help ease into the action.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	 When I’m locked in an epic battle with Fyrus, a fiery boss that looks like a Balrog ripped out of Lord of the Rings, I can barely notice that The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD is a graphical update to a 10-year-old Gamecube game. This elegantly designed encounter takes place inside the Goron Mines, and you have to make smart use of arrows and the heft of Link’s metal boots to trip the creature up and put him away. It’s a great fight; one of many emotional high points in the adventure. Twilight Princess HD doesn't always manage to look this slick, but when it does, it’s a great example of how a new coat of paint can bring back the magic of a classic Zelda game. The fact that Twilight Princess holds up 10 years later is a testament to its ambitious scale, its memorable set pieces, and of course, its finely-tuned dungeon puzzles. You have to get through a slow opening hour, but once the story kicks into gear you’re tossed from the quaint activities of small-town life and thrust into a struggle to save Hyrule from the encroaching minions of the Twilight realm. Along the way you’ll meet interesting characters like Mayor Bo, the highest authority in Ordon Village, whose secret sumo wrestling training will help you enter the Goron Mines, or Midna, a sassy sidekick who hides her motivations for helping Link. The campaign jumps skillfully between the personal plights of these characters and exploring the devilishly clever dungeons for which Twilight Princess is so rightfully remembered.  Watch Twilight Princess' opening cutscene in HD. Twilight Princess’s labyrinthine dungeons are some of the best in the series, and each requires creative usage of Link’s diverse set of items in order to best them. Whether you’re manipulating statues to mimic your movements inside the pristine Temple of Time with the Dominion Rod or using double clawshots to cross deadly gaps inside the windy Sky Temple, the constant variety feels great. In series tradition, Twilight Princess develops a natural language over the course of the adventure that makes deciphering its item-based puzzles intuitive. But there is a catch: that same variety undermines its item sandbox, relegating a handful of its more unique items to one-and-done trials. It’s a bummer to discover that items like the Spinner, Slingshot, or Ball and Chain don’t have a lot of use after the first dungeon you find them in. Twilight Princess’s labyrinthine dungeons are some of the best in the series...  While the dungeons themselves are a major highlight, it’s a shame that the overworld, and the towns that dot it, don’t get the same attention; they feel empty by comparison. Though Twilight Princess presents one of the largest incarnations of Hyrule field in the series with nice, long draw distances, packs of enemies are spread out rather thinly across it, and I didn’t find a ton of reasons to explore it outside of a handful of secrets. This was a problem for me when it was originally released in 2006, and it’s still a problem now. The same could be said about the bustling Hyrule Castle, a large space full of citizens, but few of them offer any appealing distractions from the main campaign.   The most obvious change from the original version of Twilight Princess is the substantial graphical update. The HD version uses detailed, high-definition textures in an attempt to rejuvenate Nintendo's decade-old epic for a modern audience, but the results are mixed. While looking for keys in the underground Lakebed Temple or fighting off King Bublin and his minions in an impressive battle on horseback, the graphics looked quite nice, at least at first glance. Each area benefits in some way from the added detail, with textures that add the illusion of bump-mapping to give depth to formerly simple geometry.  Watch our Twilight Princess HD Graphics Comparison between Wii U, Wii, and GameCube above. On closer inspection, though, this higher fidelity also reveals some distracting flaws, like the way the softer lighting engine doesn’t produce natural shadows, leaving places like the mountains surrounding Kakariko village looking like they're missing something. Make no mistake, this version of Twilight Princess looks far better on modern televisions than the original one ever did, but half of the time I found myself distracted by all the filed down, shadowless surfaces while wishing Nintendo had gone the extra mile to make this port stand on par with the timeless look of Wind Waker’s stunning HD facelift. Thankfully, improved controls and other additions help modernize this remaster in neat ways, from streamlining inventory management via the GamePad, which makes it easier to swap items in and out, to speeding up sluggishly paced sections of the campaign. The new Hero mode’s stiff challenge will give seasoned Zelda experts a much tougher game to play right from the start, too. Finally, Twilight Princess HD also uses amiibo as a way to customize your experience, so you can add tweaks like double enemy damage until the end of a play session or replenish hearts once a day.  Watch us venture through the Temple of Time dungeon in HD. If you buy the Wolf Link amiibo, you’ll get access to the new Cave of Shadows. It’s a tough-but-fair gauntlet of Twili enemies to fight, but I wish Nintendo had done a little more to make combat as Wolf Link more enjoyable. It just isn’t as fluid or diverse as using Link’s advanced sword techniques, like the Helm Splitter, and that makes this optional add-on much less attractive. The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess HD holds plenty of memorable moments that’ve stood the test of time, and Nintendo’s high-definition update does a lot to modernize its look and feel. This cleaner, fresher presentation is still noticeably and disappointingly flat in some ways, but just past that are some of the best puzzles and dungeons to be found anywhere in the series.
Cassidee Moser	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	 Fast Racing Neo is a fierce test of reflexes. Timing is everything as I glide along a futuristic track, soaring through the air at a breakneck speed and swerving to avoid collision with the track’s walls. My eyes are constantly focused on what’s rapidly approaching in the foreground. I veer right. I edge slightly left. Meanwhile, the scenery around my vehicle rushes past, making it difficult to even see the other racers on the track until I’m right on top of them.  It’s a tense racing game, one that thrills while simultaneously mounting a great deal of stress on the player. In order to win, you’ll have to manage the vehicle’s movement, collect orbs to fill your boost meter, and – perhaps the most unique mechanic – switch the engine color between orange and blue to match the quickly approaching boost pads scattered strategically around the track. For its strengths, however, NEO still feels a tad sterile thanks to a lack of customization options, and its difficulty is not at all friendly.   As I progress through the different circuits, Fast Racing Neo goes from challenging to brutally difficult. Opponent AI gradually grows smarter, the speed almost doubles, and the margin of error shrinks to a thin, unforgiving sliver.  You’ll have to complete a near-perfect run in order to take first, and the smallest mistake – be it a missed boost pad, bumping into the wall, or hitting an obstruction – is the difference between first place and dead last. In order to achieve success, it’s absolutely necessary to play through circuits multiple times in order to memorize the tracks and embed the movements deep into your muscle memory. It’s only when you know the layout of the track well that you can start to fully capitalize on the advanced boosting and handling functionalities offered. The margin of error shrinks to a thin, unforgiving sliver.  This demand of skill and patience often toes the line between satisfying and maddening, almost daring a player to take the skills they’ve honed and return to try again, and again, and again. I had to virtually memorize every part of a track from the twists and turns to the location of boost pads to fine-tune my timing and reaction properly. Executing a flawless run feels fantastic, but it only slightly eases the pain of ten failed attempts from before. A bit of leniency on the part of the AI - especially in the opening difficulty - would  make it slightly more palatable and allow for a player to better internalize the mechanics.   Fast Racing Neo apes ideas from the classic Nintendo racing series F-Zero, but injects enough difference to retain its own personality. The sleek, futuristic design of the 16 tracks are coupled with a variety of settings, including a snowy forest, bubbling lava pits, industrial yards, and a deep cityscape resembling the Star Wars planet Coruscant. Each setting provides thematically appropriate challenges and advantages, be it alternate routes, massive ice formations blocking the way, and frequent gaps in the track sending a racer airborne. The variety keeps it visually interesting and offers tactical options in every race.  NEO’s audio and visual design form an impressive production, a credit to attention paid to the smallest detail. Bursts of blurred color surround vehicles mid-boost, bumping into barriers causes the screen to violently shake, orbs make pleasant dings when collected, and a snarky announcer coupled with a throbbing, intense soundtrack give it a pleasing feel not unlike classic 3D racing games found in arcades. ...apes ideas from the classic Nintendo racing series F-Zero, but injects enough difference to retain its own personality.  Unfortunately, it won’t take long to see all Fast Racing NEO has to offer. The vehicles have a great design and unique look for each selection, but there are only a handful of them to unlock and I rarely found any noticeable differences between how each handled. More stats on vehicles beyond acceleration and top speed might have facilitated a wider variety of play styles, but as is, there are scant few ways for players to personalize their vehicle and overall experience. The same could be said of the actual racing, which is somewhat plagued by a dearth of options. Additional modes and options beyond career circuits, time trials, and an ultra-fast mirrored circuit called Hero Mode are very apparent in their absence, and once you’ve dug through the core circuits, there’s not much left enticing players to return. Fast Racing Neo is a grueling, rewarding racer. The temptation to chuck a controller across the room after instantly jumping from first to last will likely strike a handful of times, and it's a bit thin on customization options, but when all of its high notes line up, Fast Racing Neo is an exhilarating, devilishly grueling game that absolutely pulses with energy.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	 After many hours of riding around in mech suits and exploring the vast planet Mira, the massive scale of Xenoblade Chronicles X still amazes me. The tumultuous alien world is an artistically breathtaking landscape full of hostile foes to fight, terrain to explore, and a near-endless supply of quests to complete. It’s a long and sometimes grindy road, but the powerful mechs you eventually unlock make fighting and exploring in the hostile open reward of this action roleplaying game both rewarding and immersive. Xenoblade Chronicles X is a harrowing and unpredictable survival story of humanity getting caught in the crossfire of a galactic war. It kept me interested despite some jarringly inconsistent delivery. Most cutscenes exhibit big-budget, anime-inspired flair with great results, while others are poorly animated and limply voiced in-engine conversations that fall completely flat. The muddled presentation makes important moments feel bland, with low production value that robs emotional scenes of any dramatic weight. The script itself is well localized and the individual story chapters felt like condensed episodes of an anime, so it’s disappointing it’s not put to better use.  Much like Xenoblade Chronicles on Wii, this gorgeous alien world is very open and full of lively creatures. You can run on foot to four of its five visually distinct, monster-filled continents right from the start, giving you lots of options. Noctilum's lush, sparkling jungle is a stark contrast to the dusty, mountain-filled landscape of Oblivia, and neither resembles the green plains of Primordia. When I got my boots on the ground and explored, the enemy variety of planet Mira was immediately impressive. Roaming packs of creatures of a variety of different strengths and levels spawn everywhere, and they make the alien planet feel crowded with things to fight. The large bestiary of different enemy sizes and species made me feel like I was constantly finding new foes to fight, even as far as 50 hours into the campaign. It’s disappointing that creatures rarely interact with each other as kin or prey, though. Sometimes you’ll see packs of Fleet Evello, creatures that look like alien turkeys, migrate around a small sector together, or spot tiger-like Grex grazing in the sun, but they’re never trying to eat each other as you might expect. Mira is a hostile world for us players, but the lack of a simulated or even faked food chain often made it felt like I was exploring a large zoo at feeding time, and I’m the only food item on the menu. The city of New Los Angeles also suffers from this populated-but-lifeless feeling. Passing cars clip through your party if you run through them, and few people acknowledge your presence. Refugee earthlings don’t really make an impression, it seems. The overall sense of place is weakened further by a bad soundtrack that tries to be upbeat, but just sounds like noise instead.   Combat is what really hooked me into this RPG for the long haul. You only directly control one character in your four-person party, and you can easily switch between ranged and melee weapons, but but I found the energetic mix of real-time basic attacks and cooldown abilities highly engaging because of the way my AI-controlled teammates coordinated with me. Whenever you perform a move to topple an enemy, your computer-driven comrades seize the opportunity and pummel it into dust. At the same time, their attacks trigger opportunities for you to use complementary abilities to maximize damage and restore health. The system encouraged me to try different moves, making a cool-looking variety of moves more powerful than settling into a repeating pattern of spamming the same attacks over and over.  Developing my avatar’s strengths was also a fun and flexible experience because Xenoblade gave me three main classes and 12 subclasses to choose from. Each one feels bigger and better than the last, and the choice affects the weapons and unique special moves, called Arts, that you use in combat. The melee-focused Duelist uses a mix of up-close, DPS-focused attacks and defensive bonuses to present a balanced subclass to start with. On the other hand, Full Metal Jaguar is subclass that focuses on more offensive abilities, with buffs to boost accuracy and evasion. Xenoblade encourages you to try different classes, and even though you’re technically starting over each time you do, you unlock moves faster at higher levels. That kept me happily developing at a good pace.  Out in the wilderness, Xenoblade Chronicles X presents seemingly endless reasons to fight and wander the planet.  Out in the wilderness, Xenoblade Chronicles X presents seemingly endless reasons to fight and wander the planet. The mere act of exploring rewards you with valuable experience points, lots of collectible loot, and waypoints that double as dispensaries for precious minerals and fast-travel markers. But not all quests are created equal. The best ones send you out on hunts for troublesome boss-like enemies called tyrants, where tough fights and powerful loot await. The worst ones send you on annoying, directionless fetch quests to hunt down randomly placed collectibles.   The opening hours of this roughly 60-hour game can feel overwhelming, since there's so much to learn. But eventually, Xenoblade’s separate parts fold together into an elaborate resource system. As in nearly every RPG, the loop has you using loot to develop new weapons and gear that give you more tools to keep fighting tougher enemies, but here I found it extra rewarding because of the pace of progression. Combined with gear that randomly drops from battles, I always felt like I was growing constantly. However, Xenoblade’s inventory management system can’t keep up with all of the items it showers you with lots of items that look or sound similar. The 13 different item categories that bundles them together by type. I felt bombarded by heaps of loot that I couldn’t sort by stat values.  There’s a big prize to motivate you to deal with it, though: about 30 hours in, I built up enough wealth to develop and maintain hulking robot suits, called Skells. These powerful and expensive tools can transform into a vehicle form and are fully customizable, with 10 slots for powerful items like sabers, missile launchers, and other oversized weapons. When I climbed in, Xenoblade’s sense of scale shifted dynamically, and suddenly I was doing battle against the much larger, more intimidating foes on Mira. A towering muscular ape-like creature called a Juvenile Simius, which appeared unconquerable on foot, was suddenly something I could go toe-to-toe with. That long buildup of time-to-Skell flies by, except when you hit the tedious eight-part quest required to unlock the Skell license. It’s an dull and annoying prerequisite, especially after a lengthy preamble. Thankfully, it's a one-time ordeal.  Skells feel enormously powerful, but they don’t turn the rest of the campaign into easy street. It’s impressive that Xenoblade is able to so smoothly ramp up its challenges to match your wildly escalating power for such a long campaign. My advancements felt like leaps and bounds forward, but the monsters in my path never just laid down and let me walk all over them. The only drawback to Skells is that they’re an expensive investment, with high replacement costs if they’re destroyed in the later missions of the campaign. Xenoblade Chronicles X is a massive RPG with enough surface area, sub quests, and customization to keep you busy for many hours. It took me 73 hours to finish the main story and there's still lots of things to do. The presentation can feel stiff and awkward at times, but the satisfying loop of combat and customization makes exploring the vast world of Mira a fun and rewarding experience.
Kallie Plagge	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	 I almost fell asleep while playing Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival. I started to snooze on my sofa, so I told myself that the GamePad was dying anyway and literally went to my room to take a nap instead of playing. To its credit, amiibo Festival can be very relaxing in a uniquely Animal Crossing way… But it often feels like there’s nothing happening. Amiibo Festival’s charm and wit make up for it somewhat, but both its main board game and its minigames are simplistic and its amiibo integration clunky. It’s at its best when played with friends — otherwise, it’s slow and sleepy.   Amiibo Festival’s core attraction is a simple board game set in a typical Animal Crossing town. You have to get the most “Happy Points” to win, a sweet, adorable incentive to move around the board. However, it’s slow-paced, and there’s nothing terribly competitive about it. Simple isn’t bad, necessarily, but there’s not enough to make me want to come back to it over and over again.   Watch 10 minutes of amiibo Festival's board game above. Although there’s not much going on gameplay-wise, amiibo Festival’s main attraction is filled with cute little details. My favorites are the scenarios that pop up whenever you land on a non-event space, like watching shooting stars or talking to a friend, that result in you either losing or gaining Happy Points or Bells. Nearly every single one of the scenarios is charming, and I even paid attention to the NPCs’ turns to see what would show up.  There's not enough to the board game to make me want to come back to it.  The board game does integrate Animal Crossing’s turnip trade, the Stalk Market, very well. Buying low and trying, mostly through luck, to sell high made me feel like I was affecting my chances instead of being at the mercy of a die roll. It’s a gamble, and I sold all my turnips more than once for a modest profit only to land, to my dismay, on a space with a way better price on it the very next turn. Even with the Stalk Market, however, I still felt like I was barely doing anything besides tapping my amiibo on the GamePad and pressing A.   Two or three of Amiibo Festival’s eight minigames are strong, and even though they're not terribly complex, I still enjoyed their endearing nature. My favorites — the Quiz Show, Mystery Campers, and Island Escape — are all games my much younger self would have absolutely loved. Unfortunately, there’s not enough depth to them to keep my interest for too long. Once I played a few rounds of each minigame, I’d mastered it — every playthrough after that felt like more of the same.   How well can you do at amiibo Festival's Quiz Show? Get a peek at the questions above! The Quiz Show is the biggest standout. I've played well over a thousand hours of Animal Crossing over all the games, and I still found some of the quiz questions difficult. A lot of them require specific knowledge, like who in real life made a painting that's featured in the games, and my roommate beat me once with a combination of art history knowledge and lucky guesses. Sadly, most of amiibo Festival's minigames use amiibo cards, three of which are included, in frustrating ways. One hybrid of rock-paper-scissors and whack-a-mole required a lot of switching between amiibo cards and tapping them to the GamePad's NFC reader at the right times, but it's horribly clunky and not very fun. I ended up fumbling with the cards a lot and getting irritated. Animal Crossing: amiibo Festival is undoubtedly charming, using the world and little details of Animal Crossing to their fullest. However, there’s not enough to it to keep me coming back. The amiibo integration is cumbersome and hard to play with, and interesting ideas like the use of the stalk market are limited by a slow pace. It’s delightful enough to make me smile, but it’s still a bit boring.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	 Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash is about as paint-by-numbers as you can get. The lack of modes, characters, and new ideas make it a step backwards from the series’ debut on the Nintendo 64 back in 2000. In fact, Ultra Smash left me stretching to find any depth whatsoever. While the colorful characters and effects are definitely up to the Nintendo standard we’ve all come to expect, little else here is. The one new idea Ultra Smash has -- Mega Mushrooms that randomly pop onto the court and cause characters to grow in size -- is actively bad. Not only does it it seem arbitrary and imbalanced, but the giant characters obstruct the view of the court and veer matches into the bad kind of chaos. It’s tough for me to understand why Mario Tennis leans so heavily into this feature when it stumbles so staggeringly.   Check out Mario and Rosalina fighting Mega Bowser in the video above. While you can play classic singles or doubles matches, there’s no tournament or campaign mode whatsoever. You simply set up two or four characters to play on one of a handful of courts. No records are kept, and specific match stats are erased as soon as you exit a game. In fact, Ultra Smash really doesn’t give you any incentive to continue playing. Sure, there are 16 different total characters, a few of which you have to unlock by completing specific tasks or using in-game currency, but I found that they all pretty much played the same. A hulking Bowser doesn’t really feel any different than a floating Rosalina, which is definitely a disappointment. The only mini-game in this spartan package is Mega Ball Rally, which is a banal scenario where you see how many times you can rally with another player until one of you messes up. The fact that Mario Power Tennis on the GameCube managed to include more characters, interesting modes, and varied courses a decade ago is a bit insulting. Contrast that with the best Mario sports games, most recently Mario Golf: World Tour. Those classics are packed with different modes and challenges that help you learn and perfect specific mechanics. There’s nothing in Ultra Smash that made me want to learn how to be better.   Check out some of Mario Tennis' unlockable characters above. Even worse: If you can’t find pals to play with, prepare for a slog. The computer-controlled characters in Ultra Smash range from passable to flat-out frustrating. In Knockout Challenge, a mode where you train an amiibo, I found having an A.I. partner actively made winning matches more difficult. I can’t count the number of times my little Mario buddy hit a ball straight into my back. It’s also frustrating that training an amiibo feels so binary. Compared to Smash Bros. Wii U, where the A.I. seemed to learn how you played and adapted and grew based on that, Ultra Smash simply levels up your partner after every five matches, and randomly assigns them an unnoticeable stat increase at each notch. One thing Ultra Smash has going for it is that it’s definitely gorgeous. Seeing iconic Nintendo characters frolicking around the court is always a treat, and the effects that pop up throughout matches make the each game visually stimulating, even if it's not quite mentally there. Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash is as stripped-down a Nintendo sports game as I’ve ever played. The absence of modes, unimpressive unlockables, and tiring hook offer very little reason to keep playing. Sure, it’s pretty, but that’s about all it has going for it.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	" Editor's Note: This review was originally published on May 27, 2015, with a score of 7.9. More on our re-reviews policy. Rushing to paint the ground and claim territory in Splatoon is a frantic activity that never gets old. With it, Nintendo’s twist on the team-based shooter turns the act of making a mess into fun and chaotic matches. But this game of turf wars also has a playful sense of style, one that transforms super soakers, giant roller brushes, and even Nintendo nostalgia into a suitable paint-smearing arsenal. Don’t be fooled by Splatoon’s kid-friendly, mother-approved looks though: there’s a mechanically deep shooter hiding in those shiny pools of ink.  Territory control is a concept that you usually only hear high-level shooter players talk about, but Splatoon successfully takes this tried-and-true idea and makes it central and accessible to everyone by having us splash colorful ink everywhere to mark our turf. It plays with that idea in fun ways in each of its 4v4 competitive modes. Where Turf Wars is about drenching the map in your color and painting over the work of your rivals, the manic Rainmaker mode is about grabbing a powerful weapon at the center of the map and driving it straight into the enemy’s base. Painting a level is crucial, because as long as you’re standing in your own color, you can hit a button to instantly switch to a fast-moving but unarmed squid form. You can use it to quickly reach trouble spots, then switch back to open fire and defend your territory. It’s a fun tradeoff that encourages you to swap between the two forms constantly, and both moving and shooting feel good at a steady 60 frames per second.  Each of the 12 symmetrical maps plays with the way you paint. Each of the 12 symmetrical maps plays with the way you paint. Moray Towers has a cascade of slanted hills that dip down into a turbulent central zone, while Flounder Heights turns a commercial rooftop vista into a labyrinth warzone full of catwalks and flat blacktop. The only bummer is waiting for your favorite map to work itself into the rotation. Private matches let you play whatever map you want, but doesn’t award points to spend on new gear.   Each ink-spreading tool is built around the dual purposes of painting the ground and splatting your enemies. The whimsical Splatroller lays down a wide lane of color, but flick it and you’ve got the equivalent of a shotgun. The Splattershot is a trusty rifle, but the different variations you unlock change how fast you paint and how far you can shoot. Coupled with secondary weapons, like the Splash Wall or the Sprinkler, there’s a lot to choose from, but a handy test facility lets you experiment and pick the preset arsenal that’s just right for you. I just wish I could tweak my loadout while waiting for the sometimes-slow matchmaking to get me into a game.  Since claiming territory is such a visual activity, it’s easy to tell if enemies are nearby whenever you spot rival ink. A quick glance at the GamePad immediately tells you who’s winning a match and what areas need to be recaptured. Sadly, this doesn’t make up for the fact that Splatoon doesn’t support voice chat. So whenever I jumped into Squad Battles, I found myself dialing up my four friends on Skype so we could coordinate, but that feels like an unfair advantage.    ""...the wide range of weapons and gear sets up a great upgrade loop."" Between matches, I got a kick out of visiting the offbeat vendors of Splatoon’s charming Inkopolis. Each one sells useful gear that looks trendy and makes you more effective in multiplayer battles, and the wide range of weapons and gear sets up a great upgrade loop. And some of the arsenal is just ridiculous to look at, from ink-throwing buckets built to drench the competition to The Classic Squiffer, a long-range weapon that looks like it was made from kitchen-cleaning supplies.  I could do without the Squid Sisters, though. This pair of hosts announces major events and which multiplayer maps are available through an unskippable cutscene, and the fact that you have to suffer through their lame banter each time you boot up borders on criminal. The six-hour single-player campaign has the type of variety, pacing, and amusing boss fights you’d expect from a Mario game, albeit in a shorter form. Splatoon levels take a theme, say sliding platforms or sponge-like surfaces, and build a fun stage around it that’s challenging and well thought out. The Octarian enemies you fight are both expressive and lovingly detailed in a way that lives up to Nintendo’s high standards. It’s definitely fun until the end, but there aren’t many reasons to finish it a second time.  Beyond that there’s Battle Dojo, the forgettable offline 1v1 mode, which has you trying to shoot down more balloons than your rival. With the way Splatoon works, shooting precise targets just isn’t as fun as the rush of spraying paint everywhere to claim territory in Turf Wars. Finally, Splatoon amiibo will unlock fun additional challenges that make clever use of alternate weapons, but all of that is disappointingly locked behind a figurine paywall. On top of that, Nintendo holds regular special events, called Splatfests, that turns Turf Wars into a fun day-long community face-off, where players choose sides and rally for a team. The rewards are a little stingey, though. Nintendo’s take on the third-person shooter is refreshingly original, with lots of impressive tools, skillful mobility, and creative maps to play with. Matches are consistently fun and tense, and the mechanics feel simple and fair enough that almost anyone can contribute positively. Not having voice chat is a bummer, but the great modes and maps feel polished and kept me claiming turf for hours."
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	 At its best, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water (known as Project Zero: Maiden of Black Water in Europe) is an elegant and disturbing work of survival horror. Its sodden ghosts are genuinely unsettling, and many of its locations – foggy woods, water-logged shrines, a wooden house full of dolls – have a palpable malevolence. I can still recall rooms that were so forbidding I didn’t want to enter. But that sinister edge – brilliantly cultivated through great sound design and creepy visuals – is all too frequently undermined by some clumsy controls and repetitive combat.   Like most ghostly tales, Maiden of Black Water is obsessed with trauma – the idea that something terrible in the past can reach out and affect the present. And so it unfolds a complicated story, involving three protagonists and events that span three distinct time periods. There’s a lot going on, but it handles all these moving parts remarkably well. Over the course of a single night, all three protagonists journey up the fog-shrouded Mount Hikami. Each expedition reveals more about what took place there. It’s a satisfying structure, and I enjoyed being cast simultaneously in the roles of archaeologist and detective.   The revelations throughout this 12-hour investigation are dark and frequently disturbing, with murder and ritualistic drowning among the terrible secrets uncovered. It’s disturbing stuff, and the flashbacks make for uncomfortable viewing, but it gives Maiden of Black Water a raw sinister edge – and that’s something I’ve not experienced in a horror game for a while. It’s disturbing stuff, and the flashbacks make for uncomfortable viewing.  It’s so potent that when I found out what terrible event had occurred in a particular location, I became much more unsettled the next time I had to pass through. Sound design and lighting obviously play an important part, but simply knowing what had taken place here in the recent past was just as effective. There’s a fair bit of backtracking to be done, but the threat of repetition is well countered by the feeling of uncanny suspense created by this new information.   The only protection characters possess is a camera obscura, a mechanical device which allows you to exorcise spirits by taking pictures of them – an idea the Wii U’s GamePad was made for (or vice versa). When you activate the camera, the screen on the GamePad functions as the camera’s viewfinder. If you take the perfect shot, with the ghost and stray pieces of its spirit in view, you inflict more damage. It pleasantly reminded me of a light-gun game, but instead of being tethered to the TV, you can spin around with the GamePad, and effectively hunt ghosts around your living room. The general characters’ controls, however, are much less intuitive and precise. This is a game with a lot of tight corridors and small rooms, and it’s fiddly to manoeuvre with any precision. This is all the more frustrating since you’ll often want to turn around quickly and put distance between yourself and an evil spirit. Occasionally, I found myself accidentally leaving a room I had just entered or heading directly into the embrace of a ghost I wished to avoid. Considering how well the GamePad is implemented, it’s such a shame these more basic controls aren’t better.   Speaking of the GamePad, although the novelty of using it as a camera endures to the end, it can’t mask some highly-repetitive combat. There’s a whole range of subsidiary abilities which should lend variety and tactical depth... but they don’t. although the novelty of using it as a camera endures to the end, it can’t mask some highly-repetitive combat Camera lenses can be swapped, unlocking secondary abilities like being able to freeze ghosts or forcefully knock them back. Different characters also have slightly different cameras, too – one, for instance, can take four pictures in rapid succession. But after some experimentation, I found myself using the same lens – the one that dealt the most damage – all of the time. It’s powerful enough to render all the others pointless, unless you want to deliberately handicap yourself. There are a few other mechanics which feel similarly unbalanced and underdeveloped. Water, for example, is a prominent element, both in terms of story and gameplay. A lot of the environments are flooded, and becoming wet makes you more susceptible to attacks. You can dry yourself using a consumable, but it’s almost impossible not to immediately get wet again. Eventually I stopped drying myself off, and played through the entire game ignoring this central mechanic without any notable problems.   Again, I’d like to stress that for the first two thirds of the campaign I really enjoyed the combat system, and using the GamePad as the camera works brilliantly – it’s engaging and fun. But disappointingly, in the final stretch, you’re sucked into a succession of encounters where you fight the same handful of ghosts a ridiculous amount of times. Early on, encountering drowned shrine maidens is a chilling experience, but by the end you’ve fought so many, seen them up close so many times, that their impact is almost non-existent. In particular, the final mission feels interminable: you go through the same locations with different characters and fight droves of the same enemies. Along the way I’d used up all of my decent gear, so the end boss had to be be faced with the most basic provisions. That wasn’t fun.   Even though the repetitive combat lessens the impact of many enemies by the end, there’s still plenty of scares to be found. Most of frightening moments come from exploring Fatal Frame’s eerie locations and spotting non-aggressive ghosts wandering around the mountain. Sometimes, when you’re in the forest, if you look into the distance you can spot a ghost just staring at you through the trees. My favourite, most chilling moment came when I was exploring the second floor of a ruined house and at the window I spotted the grinning face of an old ghost just watching me. I held up my camera, but she was gone. These sinister but also elegant moments really make it stand out from most other types of survival horror. Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water is a disturbing tale well told. While the GamePad brings the series’ camera-as-a-weapon concept to life in a way that feels very natural, the combat lacks real mechanical variety, which, combined with overly repetitive encounters, undermines the impact of its most terrifying enemies. Fortunately, there’s an abundance of darkness to be found, with some of the most unsettling and stylish scares I’ve experienced in a while.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/super-mario-maker-review	 You never know what to expect in any given level of Super Mario Maker, and that element of surprise makes playing the levels made with this robust course builder incredibly fun. Super Mario Maker is a unique celebration of Nintendo’s iconic mascot. It’s also an incredibly accessible level construction kit, one where you can easily spend hours creating stages or playing levels made by a passionate community of series fans.  You’ll see a genuine reverence for Mario’s history in the 10 Mario Challenge, a mode where you’re given 10 lives to complete sample courses. There’s 68 stages in all and each one is wildly different from the other. Some remix levels from past Mario games, others showcase interesting twists and challenges that transform Mario’s standard platforming mechanics into a puzzle to be solved. Overall, it’s a fun experience, even if it can be finished in one or two sittings, depending on your skill level. 10 Mario Challenge is brief, but each sample course you unlock can then be closely examined and even disassembled in the Course Maker, an intuitive design suite where you can easily build Super Mario stages in one of four styles from the franchise’s unique history: From the original Super Mario Bros. to Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario World, and New Super Mario Bros. No matter which style you choose, creating levels is an intimidating task but the well designed interface makes learning easy and intuitive. Each piece of this do-it-yourself toolkit is well thought out, with smart button-based shortcuts, a grid-based user interface, and simple drag and drop controls. The 60 individual building blocks you use to make levels -- from ground tiles to enemies -- unlock over a 9-day period. But this careful roll-out really works because you have plenty of time to tinker with new stuff and not feel overwhelmed by too many choices.  Each day I returned to the Course Maker, I would lose track of time building stages, an experience punctuated by funny sounds and my wacky imagination of what a Mario stage could be. Despite the overall goal of keeping things simple, Super Mario Maker is a powerful toolkit that helps you build fun contraptions, distractions, and courses. However, the fact that you can’t place a checkpoint baffling. You’re forced to finish a level on one life. Sadly, not even the original Super Mario Bros., which the company released in 1985, was that cruel. But Super Mario Maker isn’t limited to just making levels for a Super Mario platformer. The tools are flexible enough that you can make all sorts of things, from special birthday messages to rube goldberg devices. The ability to personalize your stage with special character costumes or custom sounds adds another layer of personality to your creations.  The simple stylus-driven interface makes it possible to build almost anything you want, and the self-discoveries made during the process transform the act of creation into something that feels like a game itself. But the most novel part of Super Mario Maker comes from how quickly and seamlessly it jumps between stage creator and play. Once a level is complete, you can quickly upload it to Nintendo’s servers and keep track of stats and feedback via notifications. Through curated lists you can find and play the popular levels or discover up and coming designers to follow in the community. However, don’t immediately count on playing stages made by your buddies -  there’s no filter for searching levels made by people on your pre-existing Nintendo friend’s list.  The 100 Mario Challenge is a fast way to play though up to 16 user created stages in a mini-campaign from the maker community. If a level is too difficult, a quick can swipe on the GamePad will move you over to another randomly selected stage quickly. Super Mario Maker is a great way to mark Mario’s 30th birthday, but it’s not concerned with being an overwrought history lesson. Instead, it’s a celebration that folds three decades of Mario into one accessible, powerful creation suite. The perpetual joke at the end of every 10 Mario Challenge run informing you that the Princess is in yet another castle hints at Super Mario Maker’s bigger promise: There will always be more levels to play thanks to the online creation community, and a virtually endless pool of challenges to overcome.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	 Devil’s Third opens with such promise. There’s a momentary glint of intelligent commentary on the detached nature of modern war, a slow downward camera pan through a Guantanamo Bay under siege, and a somewhat indulgent solo drum performance by our hero, Ivan, as we’re treated to sepia-washed flashbacks of a history that still haunts him. The thing is, it’s all a ruse. Devil’s Third isn’t thoughtful, subtle, or even entertaining. It’s the kind of soulless, perfunctory action game I fear people judging the medium of video games by.   That initial glimmer of hope flickered out quickly once I actually took control of Ivan and started doing the only thing he can do: murder fools in a comically graphic fashion with a limited, uninteresting set of abilities. To its credit, Devil’s Third melds melee and gunplay fairly effectively but neither is varied or even immediately satisfying enough to sustain any level of excitement. Simple doesn’t have to be bad, it just is here; the repetitive melee executions come with a loss of control and a jarring camera cut, interrupting the flow of combat constantly, as if Devil’s Third doesn’t want to be played. I don’t have any problem with bald hyper-violence either, as long as it’s conveyed in a visually interesting way, or is used as a pay-off for good play, like in Mad World or Gears of War, but in Devil’s Third it’s neither. It’s hard to imagine how Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki was involved in combat so simplistic and void of tactile joy.  Melee hits have their impact blunted by tinny, cheap sound effects, and gunfire feels similarly limp. Even perennial favorites like flamethrowers, miniguns, and under-barrel grenade launchers fail to elicit a grin.  [It's] as if Devil's Third doesn't want to be played.  A lot of this could be made up for if there were interesting decisions to make in combat, or if it was mechanically demanding in some interesting way, but neither is the case. Despite silly, inconsistent damage spikes (Ivan can shrug off RPG shells, but dies near-instantly to random swarms of bats), I found it easy to strong-arm my way through the campaign in a few hours by leaning heavily on one particular attack string with the katana. Only a couple of bullet-spongey enemies made me work, and the bosses were really just exercises in monotony – I beat most of them by spamming dodge and chipping away at them a couple of quick swipes at a time. By the time the final boss fell, the only emotion I could muster was relief that there wasn’t any more to trudge through.   There is a multiplayer component to Devil’s Third, which seems odd because the combat is neither deep nor gratifying enough for me to want to play it with other people in a competitive setting. You’ll purchase equipment, choose a loadout for your character and engage in mostly pedestrian game modes, save a couple of oddball ones that don’t really fit the game’s established tone. The real insult to injury moment comes when you realize the multiplayer is riddled with micro-transactions, giving your competition a chance to buy the best equipment while you grind tirelessly for it. Devil’s Third is an exercise in cynicism, a video game seemingly created for people who secretly hate them. There’s barely even a seed of a good idea here, let alone a fully formed one. There isn’t a single part of Devil’s Third that does not feel as though it were ripped straight from a decade-old playbook, and its nihilistic reliance on simplistic violence reinforces that fact with every severed limb.
Jared Petty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	 Within five minutes of starting Earthbound Beginnings, my baby sister’s kewpie doll came to life and tried to kill me, a hippie accosted me on a country road, and my father revealed that I was heir to an ancient reservoir of psychic power. This long-lost predecessor to the classic SNES RPG Earthbound (also known as Mother in its native Japan) doubles down on a charming commitment to weirdness from the very first moments, and the resulting unpredictability unfolds into an engaging, entertaining story that eschews traditional high-fantasy RPG archetypes. Unfortunately, the whimsical tone is paired with a downright painful reliance on near-endless random battles that lock much of that fun behind walls of tedious grinding.  Clever dialogue and zany story arcs tickled my funny bone dozens of times over the course of the long adventure. Puns like “Polar Bear just grins and bears it,”, snarky one- liners, and original gags are everywhere, and most are surprisingly well-localized considering Earthbound Beginnings’ 1989 Japanese vintage. The classic RPG formula of demanding that you speak to every townsperson is harnessed to excellent effect, as conversations become a medium for delivering delightful jokes occasionally punctuated by thoughtful, philosophical musings. Anachronistic translation issues do occasionally interrupt the general charm of the storytelling, such as the otherwise- tender phone conversations with my father than always ended with his slamming the receiver down, but by and large the humor is remarkably on-target. Yet Earthbound Beginnings excellent writing is painfully tied to a frustratingly high random-encounter rate. Even with my expectations set by extensive experience with 8-bit RPGs, I was flabbergasted by how slowly and clumsily it rewarded me for victory in combat. The paltry experience gained after each battle doesn’t begin to keep pace with the progression of the story, so I often found myself eager to move ahead to the next intriguing plot point but maddeningly unable to advance. All too often I had to walk in circles waiting for fights to trigger so I could claw my way up the experience chain. The least enjoyable moments of Beginnings are spent wandering the woods near a healing point, farming experience for hours at a stretch and itching to be done with the mundane pummeling fighting so I could discover what story delights awaited ahead. The battles themselves are interesting enough, especially after the party fleshed out to a full three-kid roster. Despite the simple turn-based mechanics, my vast arsenal of powerful PSI abilities and strange equipment gave me a lot of freedom to approach combat in different ways. I learned that creative use of my many options allowed me to overcome some seemingly impossible challenges with interesting tactical solutions, negating the abilities of powerful foes and syphoning away their resources to restore my party. I happily discovered that some encounters have ridiculous, novel solutions (in keeping with the irreverent tone of Earthbound) such as the dungeon packed with Groucho Marx faces who randomly showered me with experience if I ignored their attacks. The battles grew riskier near the final act when even the best-planned brawls sometimes went awry due to a steep uptick in enemy strength, and I was very thankful for the Wii U’s save state feature which allowed me to frequently protect my progress in high-risk areas. As I traveled Beginnings’ enormous world, I found myself humming along with the catchy melodies. This quirky story is largely about collecting songs, and the creators invested significantly in a wide catalog of distinctive tunes that never grew tiring over the course of my 15-plus-hour expedition. Along with songs, I collected a series of delightful experiences that added a sweet, playful, and nostalgic flavor to the journey. A surprising fourth-wall-breaking moment where the protagonist's father called me on the telephone to thank me for taking such good care of his son touched me with its sincerity and charm, and served as a clever trojan horse for inserting my name into the closing credits. A side quest allowing my elementary school heroes to bribe grown ups to teach them swear words has negligible mechanical impact, but thematically I was delighted at the designers’ commitment to drawing me into the mindset of a group of eight-year-olds. I wish there weren’t so much tedious combat filler in the long wanderings between bright points in this intriguing, amusing story. Earthbound Beginnings feels like a massive, unparsed prototype for its legendary successor, with a “kitchen sink” design philosophy that reflects too many ideas and not enough balancing. It makes the experience an uneven one, but there’s such a zest to the world and story that it’s worth powering through.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	 Yoshi’s Woolly World is surely a contender for the cutest game ever made. Dozens of knitted dinosaurs inhabit an island crafted from felt, foam, cotton wool, and sequins. While Nintendo has already played with this style before in 2010’s Kirby’s Epic Yarn, Yoshi’s Woolly World does a much better job of exploring its potential. It’s always a pleasant adventure with interesting mechanics dotted about, but occasionally it pulls it all together and creates some really great levels, which feel specifically designed around Yoshi, and those really make it worth playing.  This arts-and-crafts ecosystem is a mellow and idyllic world in which to spend ten or so hours. The colours are rich and vibrant, the textures are great, and it’s got some ridiculously catchy tunes. It all has an endearing handmade finish, with plenty of exposed stitching and loose threads on show. The textile conceit is really sold by small, wonderful details, like when Yoshi tugs at one of those threads it can unravel and turn into a butterfly, which flutters offscreen to reveal a secret area. (I told you it was a contender for the cutest game ever made.) There’s so many of these wonderful imaginative touches. Shy Guys are armed with crochet hooks, ready to unpick their enemies. A a soft halo of fuzz surrounding knitted characters catches the light as they move. Yoshi himself, being made of thread, unravels and recombines himself in subtle ways to suit his environment: on ice, his feet weave themselves into skates and in water, they turn into a big propeller. Woolly World really makes the most of its setting, and invests a lot of imagination into elaborating it; I noticed little details right up until the very end that made me grin. The textile aesthetic always creates a world which is visually appealing and comforting to explore, but sometimes it does more, producing levels and instances of gameplay that could only exist within the logic of this world. These stages also succeed because they’re thoughtfully designed in a way to challenge Yoshi and his abilities. Actually, Yoshi’s a bit of a problem for most traditional platforming situations. His tongue and ability to throw balls of yarn allows for enemies to be tackled at a distance, while his hover-jump forgives most errors of judgement. But at its best Woolly World concocts levels that are challenging even for Yoshi.  There’s a brilliant Boo level in which a curtain passes across the screen, revealing platforms and enemies in silhouette that can’t be seen otherwise. The curtain moves quickly in the foreground, and soon there are multiple drapes overlapping and disappearing, resulting in a level which is in constant flux. Yoshi’s hover-jump is now essential, allowing you to take calculated leaps into the unknown and, sometimes, buy precious seconds until safe ground materialises. It no longer feels like a bit of a cheat, since the circumstances demand it be used with precision and skill. Woolly World doesn’t consistently reach those heights, but there’s still plenty of fun and inventive stuff to play around with in its less memorable levels. It’s also hard to get bored since levels regular shake-up the pace. You can thrown baby chickens to create temporary clouds of cotton wool. Slide through jungles, leaping between curtains. And there are fantasy interludes in which Yoshi transforms into a motorbike or an umbrella, but sadly these sections last for no more than 30 seconds and occur so sporadically they never feel like a core part of the experience. It’s a shame as they provide some brilliantly surreal moments, like when I kung-fu kicked a log fort as Yoshi patterned like a cow. (More of this please.) I could definitely have done without the monotonous mid- and end-stage boss battles, however, which all end up feeling like variations of each other.  You can zip through levels in a few minutes, but there’s a multitude of collectibles entreating you to go back. They include beads, stamps, daisies, and balls of wool. It’s all a bit much, and the desirability of each one varies quite a bit. The only ones I found myself interested in were the daisies and wool, as they have the most enjoyable and satisfying rewards. If you collect all 40 daisies in a given World, a Special Stage is unlocked. These levels tend to be some of the strongest in the game, so it’s a shame you have to find every daisy, which in truth is a bit of a slog. Collecting wool nets you a more immediate prize in the form of a new playable Yoshi. It’s the same basic character model but there are some cool and weird patterns to be found, including a Shy Guy disguise and one that makes Yoshi resemble the inside of a watermelon. They’re frivolous but I found collecting them to be surprisingly addictive. I found stamps and beads, on the other hand, much less appealing. The former are acquired by collecting specific gems, which are plentiful and spread throughout levels, but the catch is there’s no way of knowing which bead secretly contains a stamp. So effectively the challenge is to collect every bead. It's part of a bigger problem: invisible items, hidden areas which can’t be visually detected whatsoever, and concealed item boxes appear throughout Woolly World. You’ll probably come across the most important ones, but I never felt like these were rewards for my natural curiosity; they rewarded my determination to scour every inch of a level. Ultimately, stickers aren’t worth it, while gems allow you to purchase Power Badges, a range of power-ups and perks that last for an entire level. They’re fun, make the game easier, though tellingly the badge I equipped the most was the one that revealed all hidden items.  There’s a handful of really great levels in Yoshi’s Woolly World, which makes the most of its setting and choice of character. The world is exactly what I expected, thematically and in terms of structure: sand, snow, clouds, and fire, punctuated by bosses holed-up in themed fortresses. It’s incredibly familiar, but the imaginative and attractive art style makes it feel fresh and appealing. Outside of those great few levels, Woolly World is a more forgettable and fragmented experience. Cool mechanics are cooked up, but they’re dropped into levels which never realise their full potential and fixate more on unearthing frustrating collectibles.
Samuel Claiborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	" You might remember the thrill of your first teenage party: Maybe you snuck out; perhaps there were older kids there; there was definitely beer. If Mario Party 10 is your first Mario Party, I think you're going to have a great time. If, like me, you've been Mario Partying for 17 years straight, you might feel like quietly slipping out the back. Mario Party 10 adds a bunch of new features including amiibo, and the second screen of the GamePad, but it also carries over some bad ideas from Mario Party 9 that continue to deflate the fun. Mario Party's core idea (a virtual board game with minigames to shake things up) is smart, but recent iterations have dropped the more complex rules and options that make board games interesting in the first place. Mario Party 10's game boards are linear, with little complexity. Dice rolls move all characters together in one vehicle on rails, meaning fate – not strategy or skill – decides pretty much everything but minigames. And here's the kicker: In the main Mario Party mode, a new rule change means you don't actually get to play the minigames that often. So what is the point of this, exactly? When you get to play them the minigames are great. They often take advantage of Super Mario 3D World's aesthetic and gameplay – right down to clear pipes and squirrels. It looks great in HD, and makes four-player split-screen minigames much easier to follow. The technical improvements aren't without hiccups, though: load times before and after each minigame can get pretty long. The best minigames have the partiers navigating obstacle courses of moving and/or vanishing platforms by running and jumping, using the Wii Remote like an NES controller. You know: Mario stuff. In one game, platforms disappear into lava, leaving survivors on tiny islands with just enough room for you to edge an opponent into the goop. Your old Wii Remotes get plenty of use in their various motion-based modes, too: Track a certain Goomba in a crowd and point at it with your crosshairs; waggle the Wiimote until your balloon nearly bursts, then hold it really still so an extra waggle doesn't push it past its breaking point. There are some less fun tilt-based games, like a soccer match on giant balls that will have you contorting to win. Motion controls may sound regressive in 2015, but in the thick of the Mario Party, it's all goofy fun. I wish I could tell you to just play Mario Party for the minigames, but you actually don't get to play that many of them. In Mario Party mode, you only play a minigame if you land on a minigame space – and they’re rare enough that it's entirely possible to play an entire game without hitting one. Minilame!   Bowser Party not only introduces a fifth player to the party, but also makes use of the Wii U GamePad – a fittingly large controller for the role of Bowser as master party crasher. In this mode, up to four players share a car and roll dice to flee from Bowser on one of three boards shared with Mario Party mode (two are unavailable for some reason) while Bowser rolls a handful of dice in an attempt to catch up at the end of each turn. If Bowser catches up, he takes on the four other players in a 1v4 minigame. Interestingly, these games are balanced individually to favor either Bowser or the partiers. As Bowser gets more ""angry"" throughout a match, the minigames you play will be tilted in his favor.  Playing as Bowser is a blast: You blow fire at scurrying players; mess with their minds by rotating and stopping a giant wheel that throws them into flames; and officiate a game of BINGO that the partiers pretty much always lose. You do all this with your own screen and set of controls, so others can't see your scheming. I highly recommend the submarine game board, where the Bowser player gets to draw on the GamePad to try and trick players into choosing the wrong path on the big screen. You don't actually have that much psychological sway, but taunting with GamePad graffiti is totally gratifying. Whether you are Bowser or not, this five-person modification of Mario Party is 10's greatest achievement – and one of the best uses of the Wii U GamePad yet.   Amiibo Party requires Nintendo's interactive toys (amiibo), but amiibo aren't exactly the life of the party. Each player must keep an amiibo and a Wii Remote on hand at all times, with the GamePad sitting at some place within reach of all players (which was awkward both in my living room and in the office).  The integration of amiibo amounts to little more than constantly tapping the figures to a sensor in the corner of the GamePad. You tap to roll, tap to stop random spinners, tap to use items… You tap the GamePad a lot. In between amiibo tapping, you play an old-school version of Mario Party: You get to move as separate characters (yay!), and there's a minigame after each round (yay!), but there's a huge catch: The game boards in this mode are small, linear, squares. You can swap out corners of the squares with different Mario themes, but they left me and my fellow partiers yawning. And tapping.  Lurking in Mario Party 10's bonus menu is a great standalone game called Jewel Drop, which captivated the office for a few hours one day. It's a clever color-matching game not unlike Dr. Mario, but with a spin: Physics apply. Your stacks of jewels can collapse, or you can intentionally shake them up to make a bunch of matches and slam your opponent with a deluge of Jewels. In my experience, two types of people get the most enjoyment out of Mario Party: Small children and inebriated adults. Nintendo's intended audience in Mario Party 10, as with its predecessors, is clearly kids (they will probably love the amiibo tapping). But when you design something just for kids you can run into something I'll call Candylandization: flashy stuff that requires no thought whatsoever. Kids gleefully absorb it, but adults only suffer through it for kids’ sake. But it doesn't have to be that way. Nintendo, and the Mario franchise in particular, has a history of making games that are enjoyable for all ages. Mario Party 10 isn’t one of them. There's always next time."
Brendan Graeber	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	 Throughout the years, Mario games have often been synonymous with clever innovation and new ideas built on a tried-and-true formula. Not this one. Despite the challenging puzzles of Mario vs Donkey Kong: Tipping Stars’ later levels, we never really see anything new or different, and its big idea to encourage and reward community-designed levels is a bust, thwarted by cynical players. Tipping Stars plays out much like its likeable Mario vs Donkey Kong predecessors: guide Lemming-like toy versions of Mario characters through small hazardous areas. You have no direct control over their movements, but you can control their environments with your stylus to force them onto a safe path using girders, conveyor belts, pipes, springs and more. It’s helpful that you can effectively pause the action while stretching out girders and conveyor paths to get their placement right, though I find it makes things a bit too easy to plan ahead in some levels. However, even with that advantage, getting gold-medal scores by collecting coins along the way requires expert timing.   Some of the later levels had me frantically placing and picking up girders, blocks, and conveyor belts just moments before my mini-Mario would’ve careened over the edge of a spike-filled pit – and I loved every moment of it. What I didn’t love was getting through the over 40 introductory levels that felt more like a series of simple mechanical tasks to be completed than puzzles I needed to think about to get past. Even when the challenge ramped up, though, I was never given the same sense of awe that tells me a puzzle game is something novel and special. As someone who’s played previous Mario vs. Donkey Kong games, the lack of new ideas is disappointing. The highlight of Tipping Stars’ meager innovations is a cursed mini-Mario that wanders the map as a moving hazard until you whack him with a hammer, but even he never significantly changed the way a level played. Likewise, neither the 3DS nor Wii U versions take advantage of their touchscreens beyond simple stylus tapping and dragging. At least there’s a lot of content, and more on the way. Each of the six main worlds teaches you a new mechanic or block to work with, and by the eighth and final stage of that world you’ll have to prove you’ve been paying attention. Add that to the two additional worlds unlocked later, and the three bonus worlds unlocked by earning gold trophies, and you’ll have a lot to learn and master.   If that wasn’t enough already, the level editor workshop makes its return, along with the new and improved community hub where you can upload and share levels across both the 3DS and Wii U. This is where Tipping Stars gets its name: you can both collect stars from completing a community-made stage, and give them to a stage’s creator as a “tip” for a job well done. These stars can be used to unlock more tools and cosmetic changes in the workshop. Using that to encourage people to build and post interesting levels to keep the puzzle love happening long into the future is a brilliant model... in theory. In practice, there’s one tiny hiccup: as of writing, a quick glance at the top 50 popular stages (it’s hard to view anything other than that) shows that most are quick and easy levels designed to get you stars fast. And of course, who wouldn’t give a “Yeah” rating to a stage that essentially gives you something for nothing, and helps unlock those bonuses right away? They’re basically cheats, and it’s a shame when you think about the many smart amateur level designers out there who spend their time crafting challenging and creative levels for us to play, only for nobody to actually see it because it’s buried under countless crappy free-star levels. Thankfully, there is still one more place to look for challenge: The Nintendo Official Levels. Starting with the release of Tipping Stars, Nintendo has promised that two new levels will be uploaded by developers every week, for 50(!) weeks straight. One other notable thing about Tipping Stars is that it’s the first Nintendo game to offer cross-buy, meaning a purchase for either the 3DS or Wii U will net you a code for the other platform. This is great in theory, until you find that it was meant to be played on a small touchscreen with a stylus, so the Wii U version offers virtually no benefit over the portability of the 3DS – the screen’s a bit larger, but you can’t take it with you. That’s not to say the Wii U version is entirely inferior, as families or friends can still gather around the TV to give tips, but Tipping Stars’ short but challenging level structure feels much more at home when you're on the go, waiting in line, or looking to kill some time. Whether you’re a Mario vs. Donkey Kong series veteran or are diving into the toy-puzzle scene for the first time, Tipping Stars will (eventually) challenge you with tough stages to master, even if it doesn’t exactly bring anything new of value to the table. There’s even more challenge and fun to be had via the community - but you need to dig through a mountain of nonsense to find it.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse-review	 Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a brisk, gorgeous platformer that has no qualms with taking off the training wheels. Built on the same tenants as 2005’s fantastic Kirby: Canvas Curse for the original DS, this Wii U sequel places all of the power in your stylus, which makes for a refreshing experience that feels different than most 2D platformers. Its dependence on touch controls make it a slightly awkward fit for the Wii U, but this beautiful world looks and plays great on the GamePad. Like in the DS original, you don't directly control Kirby in the traditional platforming sense. Instead, you rely on the stylus to draw a track using a finite amount of rechargeable ink for the little pink puff to roll on. It’s sort of a weird concept to wrap your head around at first, but once I settled into a groove, I was avoiding enemies, building momentum downhill, and completing levels without ever letting Kirby touch the ground. More complex tactics, like blocking projectiles with hand-drawn walls and collecting 100 stars to transform into a giant bullet make control of Kirby a deep, and rewarding endeavor.   And you’ll definitely need to hit your groove, because Rainbow Curse quickly bares its adorable fangs. One-hit kill enemies, tricky bosses, and levels littered with traps make for some really tough, but ultimately rewarding challenges. That might be a little scary if you were hoping to share this cartoonish-looking game with a more novice gaming partner, but the good news here is that 1UPs are in abundance, so having to replay a particularly tricky section isn’t the end of the world. Rainbow Curse’s 28 stages, which took me about seven hours to get through, keep you moving at a brisk pace. Levels change in style and layout all the time, and throw in some much-appreciated variety like these vehicular stages. That said, I felt that the average level by and large was a bit too long. Canvas Curse kept stages to brief, tight challenges that brought back shades of Super Mario 3's brevity, whereas this follow-up tends to deliver a few too many levels that outstay their welcome. While I loved making my way through the levels for their visual variety and beauty -- going from sunken ships to cloud kingdoms to fiery volcanoes made the adventure fly by in a breeze -- I never really felt the urge to stop and collect the wealth of doo-dads scattered across the world. Where a game like Yoshi’s Island encouraged 100% completion in order to unlock some of its finest stages, Kirby’s in-game trophies, statues, and music samples didn’t really entice me to dig into every nook and cranny. So let’s talk about the elephant in the room: Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is absolutely gorgeous. The entire world and all of its inhabitants have a unique, hand-molded look to them that makes it unmistakable among its peers. It joins the ranks of Tearaway, Okami, and a handful of other fantastic experiences that truly feel like you’re playing inside of a tangible world. Small touches, like fingerprint indentations on character models, separate Kirby from any other game out there. Particularly impressive are the bosses. The iconic Whispy Woods huffs and puffs like a stop-motion creature ripped straight out of a Laika movie.   The tactile nature of the world doesn’t just come across aesthetically, but also in the way you interact with the each level. Chip away at blocks of clay and using your rainbow powers to shield yourself from waterfalls really helped solidify the bond between my hand and the game world. That said, the stylus-focused nature of the mechanics means you have to keep your eyes on the Wii U GamePad at all times, meaning that you miss out on the full beauty on your television. To soak in all the detail, I’d rather watch someone play than play again myself. Speaking of, Rainbow Curse supports up to three additional players, each of which can control their own Waddle and help maneuver Kirby around the world. It doesn't really add a whole lot to the experience, but the drop-in, drop-out nature of the multiplayer makes it a nice experiment to test out.  Like its DS predecessor, Kirby and the Rainbow Curse is a delightfully charming and unique platformer. Its world is varied, its challenge is high, and the hand-molded look and feel make for a remarkable journey. The never-ending barrage of charm more-than makes up for some of its less-than stellar elements. There’s a pot of platforming gold at the end of this rainbow.
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/12/stealth-inc-2-a-game-of-clones-review	 Stealth Inc. 2 doesn’t hide its inspiration from games like Splinter Cell and Portal. From the soft green glow of the clone’s goggles while crouching in the shadows, to the ever-present antagonist humorously berating you as you progress, the comparisons aren’t hard to make. But, thanks to its incredibly challenging puzzle design - buoyed by a variety of gadgets and brilliant progression - and its great implementation of Wii U-specific features, Stealth Inc. 2 doesn’t just differentiate itself from the games that influenced it; it stands out as one the best games available on the eShop.  In Stealth Inc. 2, you control a squat, bulbous clone who is helping his more dimwitted clone brethren escape their dire fate. Exploring the sprawling cloning facility is a harrowing, rewarding affair thanks to the variety of gadgets - which grant abilities like hacking, teleporting, and even cloning - that continuously provide interesting new ways to overcome the ever-more difficult puzzles and enemies. In each new section of the facility, you’ll come across test chambers that introduce you to a new gadget and provide a variety of different challenges that require its use. With each test chamber you complete, more of that section of the facility becomes available, until, ultimately, you receive the gadget and are able to use it freely outside of the test chambers. In addition to that, each test chamber also features a leaderboard with the fastest completion times, providing impetus to replay them multiple times. I was impressed with how brilliant this try-it-before-you-get-it design is.The first gadget, the Inflate-a-Mate, is a small device that can be freely thrown around and then inflated to make a platform. The test chambers started out with me using it to simply reach higher ledges, but then slowly introduced other applications, like inflating it in mid-air to crush an enemy robot or using it as a shield to block lasers. By the time I completed all its test chambers, I felt like an expert with the gadget, and once I was free to use it in the facility, I was able to immediately explore a variety of previously inaccessible locations. The balance between utilizing the mastered gadgets freely and learning the ins-and-outs of a new one in isolated test chambers is fantastic. While the test chambers enforce all the different ways to use a single gadget, it’s through combining them with your clone’s other abilities in the facility that you’ll really be pressed. The high of collecting another gadget was always followed by the realization that there was now one more possible variable in solving the oncoming puzzles. Still, that made every cracked puzzle - “oh, I should hack the robot, lift him onto this ledge, have him flip this door’s switch and then teleport up there” - all the more rewarding. In the moments where I was stumped by a puzzle and scratching my head, it was Stealth Inc. 2’s twisted sense of humor that usually kept me going. A begrudged scientist - who is one clone kill away from being the employee of the month - watches over your clone’s progress, and projects hilariously dark messages onto the walls, many of which will taunt you as your clone is crushed, fried, sliced or otherwise murdered. Stealth Inc. 2’s implementation of Miiverse also helps with trickier puzzles, as other players can leave messages throughout the facility to provide hints as to what to do next. It feels like a more descriptive version of the messaging system in Dark Souls 2, and it definitely saved me from banging my head against the wall for too long.  While crouching in the shadows to avoid sentry robots and surveillance cameras is a pivotal mechanic of Stealth Inc. 2, the facility itself is monotonously dark. There are a few brief moments where your clone is on the exterior of the facility, with a sunset providing a rich orange backdrop, but the majority of Stealth Inc. 2 is spent in darkness. I found exploring the drab facility to be especially trying while playing on the GamePad, as the lower resolution made hidden vents and passages that much harder to discover. While off-TV play isn’t great for extended periods of time, the GamePad is put to good use in the surprisingly robust co-op mode. The player using the GamePad is able to view the entire room, and can draw messages on the screen or circle important locations which then appear on the TV for the co-op partner. The GamePad player also has unique abilities not available in single-player, such as making the clone invisible or producing a decoy clone to distract the enemy robots. To provide extra challenge, some of Stealth Inc. 2’s enemies will be invisible on the TV, requiring the GamePad user to uncover them for the other player to see. I expected this mode to simply feature two clones running about, but instead, it provides an incredibly fun and thoughtful twist on Stealth Inc. 2’s gameplay.  Depending on your mental fortitude, Stealth Inc. 2 will probably take anywhere from five to 10 hours to complete. Luckily, if you’re in the mood for more clone espionage after you’re done, there is a level editor and community-built levels to enjoy. Using the level editor isn’t the most intuitive experience, but all the tools are there to make great puzzles for your friends or the online community. I sampled a few of the more highly-rated custom stages, and while they weren’t quite up to par with the quality of the test chambers, they provided enough of a challenge to keep me engaged. Thanks to its clever puzzle design and brilliant progression, Stealth Inc. 2: A Game of Clones sets itself apart from its more obvious inspirations. While the world is mostly dark and drab, utilizing the variety of interesting multi-purpose gadgets to solve puzzles and explore the cloning facility is incredibly rewarding, and the leaderboards provide the impetus to replay sections until they are mastered. Combine all that with excellent implementation of the Wii U’s unique features, including Miiverse messages and the GamePad’s use during the robust co-op mode, and you have a game that is among the best the eShop has to offer.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review	 Captain Toad Treasure Tracker is one of the smartest, most charming puzzle games of 2014. I’d also call it one of the best platformers of the year, except these characters can’t jump. It speaks volumes about Treasure Tracker’s wit and environment design that it completely strips us of the mobility powers that we’ve come to expect from a game set in the Super Mario universe and still provides lots of interesting puzzle options. Expanding on the handful of refreshing and challenging Captain Toad levels from Super Mario 3D World, Treasure Tracker is about navigating Toad or Toadette through small stages by rotating the camera, observing the world around you, and avoiding the mess of enemies and traps that stand in your way. New abilities and twists, such as rhythm-based platforms that disappear on certain beats, and the cherry that can double, triple, or quadruple your character keep the entire six-hour journey feeling fresh.   Each of the 70-ish, bite-sized stages in Captain Toad are laid out like an MC Escher-designed diorama floating in space, and they’re all filled with great puzzles. There’s a great sense of discovery in exploring every nook and cranny of a stage, poking around the GamePad and seeing what you can interact with, and observing your surroundings from every imaginable angle. Guiding the Toads through the stages and learning enemy patterns in order to sneak past them always felt great, and being able to make it through a level in what felt like the optimal manner was nice and satisfying. Most stages only require you to find a star in order to move on, with optional feats that include grabbing a trio of gems, and a unique bonus objective for each level. The stages are relatively simple to complete, but finding all of the secrets gets genuinely challenging. And I always felt motivated to pore over everything, thanks to some really great post-game secrets that can only be unlocked by discovering most of the gems. Most of the time, Captain Toad moves at a slow pace and allows you to take your time navigating each level. You are always in full control of the camera, and while it definitely seemed a bit micro-manage-y, I like the freedom to view the world at whichever angle I wanted. The problem here is that it’s controlled both through the right stick and the GamePad’s gyrosensor, and the sensor can’t be turned off, so I found the camera spinning out of control whenever I moved my wrists. Also, if you’re playing only off the GamePad, messages and touch-screen prompts have a tendency to pop up and really obscure your view at important moments.   Without a single word of text, Nintendo managed to create a pair of sweet, endearing characters that I genuinely wanted to root for. Small details, like how Toad and Toadette cower in fear when they see a ghost, add a nice dollop of charm to the whole package. Sweet storybook vignettes add some extra motivation for pressing on, and the way Treasure Tracker ultimately ties into Super Mario 3D World is pretty great. It’s a bummer that the overall package feels a bit cheap because of interface problems. There’s no screen that displays all of your stats on each level, which meant I had to constantly page through the 70 stages to see what I still needed to accomplish. You also can’t see the optional objective within the levels themselves, which seems like a silly thing to omit. Treasure Tracker takes the core concept of Captain Toad and runs wild with it. It’s a smart, adorable puzzle game that presents some awesome locales and really rewards you for taking the time to unpack them. Despite the control issues and menu problems, Captain Toad Treasure Tracker proves that you can still be great without being Super.
Steve Butts	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/22/lego-batman-3-beyond-gotham-review	 Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham hews close to the series’ formula, pairing uncomplicated gameplay with a deep, charming dive into decades’ worth of DC Comics stories and history. But after the impressive freedom of Lego Batman 2 and Lego Marvel, Lego Batman 3 feels far more restrictive in scope, and its inconsistent tone sometimes seems to mock the great DC Comics source material it should be celebrating. Picking up from the end of Lego Batman 2, the villain Braniac drives most of the fun but scattered plot in Lego Batman 3. Without giving too much away, Batman and the rest of the Justice League have to team up with the likes of Lex Luthor, the Joker, and the rest of the Legion of Doom to bring him down, and sort out some trouble with the various Lantern Corps. It’s not as strong or as focused a story as in either Lego Marvel or Lego Batman 2, but it manages to keep the interest high through most of the 10 hours or so it took to finish it. To ensure constant variety, Lego Batman 3 uses the same format as Lego Marvel, where different playable characters drop in and out of the missions at each checkpoint. You may be playing as Batman and Robin one moment, and then Green Lantern and Martian Manhunter the next. It definitely helps break up the action, which otherwise might get old quickly due to the simplistic attacks, and celebrates a larger roster of DC favorites. The best new addition to the system is that you can now load specific checkpoints of missions for Free Play; it makes finding all those little secrets so much more convenient.  When the story missions are finished, there’s loads more to do here, including plenty of other mission-style content. We’re sort of left to figure that stuff out for ourselves, which is actually not such a bad thing; accidentally stumbling on a mission that recreates an old Adam West Batman TV show episode was fantastic. There are also options to explore the Hall of Justice and Hall of Doom, which are super fun for a DC fan like myself. I also enjoyed unlocking some of the more obscure characters from the DC canon – I’m sure not many people are exactly champing at the bit to play as Etrigan or The Question, but it’s great that those more obscure characters get to share the stage with the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman. It’s clear the game makers love the source material. From Wonder Woman’s idle animation where she does the Linda Carter-style twirl to Flash’s frequent stints on the Cosmic Treadmill and the payoff of that final revelation between Batman and Robin, Lego Batman 3 does a great job of showcasing moments that’ll resonate with fans of the comics. While it’s not quite as developed here as it was in Lego Marvel, I still appreciate that each character has a unique combination of abilities. Martian Manhunter and Superman both have heat vision, but the green guy can also control minds, while Supes has frost breath. This approach to character powers gives us lots of options, which are furthered by the excellent new suit system. No longer do you have to wait to find a station to swap out for the Magnet suit or the Sonar suit, because now characters like Batman, Robin, and Cyborg can change their power setups on the fly. Being able to change at will to any suit you’ve unlocked eliminates a lot of tedium. Even better, a quick button press instantly swaps you to the suit that’s appropriate to the obstacle you’ve encountered.  While not every game has to be open-world to be good, playing Lego Batman 3 made me long for the freedom of Lego Batman 2.  Instead of roaming through the streets of Gotham at your discretion, you’re mostly just running back and forth between the Batcave and the Watchtower. There are limited open-world options for the various Lantern planets, but those aren’t part of the main story and are generally small and pretty light on things to do. So why even have these unlockable vehicles if there’s nowhere fun to drive them? My biggest disappointment with Lego Batman 3 is its inconsistent tone. The developers definitely love the source material, but there are moments where they take a substantial step away from familiar franchise turf to introduce elements that immediately start to erode the fun of being in the world of the comics. When Braniac comes to Earth, we don’t get to battle him in iconic DC locations like Smallville, Gorilla City, or Paradise Island; No, Braniac just terrorizes Paris or Pisa.  Shortly after that, you spend the final third of the story missions on a sort of sci-fi tour through unfamiliar Lantern worlds, which is kind of a letdown.  I also have to question the decision to include these annoying cameos. Instead of DC’s quintessential everyman Jimmy Olsen, this game’s ubiquitous hanger-on is Conan O’Brien. He’s all over the place, repeating the same gags every time you see him. After a while, making jokes about how there are no Labradors in the Batcave laboratory gets kind of old. You even end up spending quite a bit of time with Daffy Duck as Green Loontern, which, again, kills the mood for me. Yes, I get it; it’s a game where Cyborg can fool a security camera by turning into a washing machine, but there’s a difference between making a joke about the characters and just surrounding them with other stuff that also happens to be part of the Warner Bros. empire. (I didn’t have as much of a problem with the inclusion of references to the Batman TV show because that, at least, seems to make some sense within Lego Batman 3’s world – and unlike Daffy Duck, Adam West isn’t hanging around the Watchtower talking about space the whole time.) I like Lego Batman 3: Beyond Gotham, but I don’t love it as much as I’ve loved previous games in the series. It definitely delivers on the promise of letting me play with charmingly realized versions of many of my favorite DC heroes and villains, and it even presents a setting with lots of great surprises, challenges, and systems that promote variety. As a longtime DC fan, I do wish it had given me the chance to dig into more locations and plot elements from the comics, but the biggest hurdle for me to clear is the bizarre cameos.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/19/super-smash-bros-for-wii-u-review	" I never thought Smash Bros.’ intense four-player multiplayer battles needed more fighters, but eight-player brawls have become one of my favorite modes in Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Eight-player battles are local-only,  which is an unfortunate limitation, but if you get a group of friends together you’ll fill these big, vibrantly colorful arenas with sheer madness happening in every corner. Each character displays fantastic personality in combat, drawing on a rich history from dozens of different beloved games. As I strike, dodge, block, and weave through seven other fighters, a match builds up to a climax that’s genuinely fun, each and every time. That represents Super Smash Bros. for Wii U as a whole: it’s bigger than ever, but remains laser-focused on the finely balanced action that makes this a legendary fighting game series.  Smash Bros. Wii U wraps more than 30 years of gaming history together into an approachable brawler. Every fighter in the 49-strong roster uses the same button-presses to execute attacks and special moves, but each has their own distinct style that’s fun to learn. It makes them simple to pick up and play, but also challenging to master. Bowser, for example, uses burly strikes and kicks to pummel foes into submission, while Smash Bros. newcomer Duck Hunt uses a tricky move set of clay-pigeon projectiles, explosive barrels, and attacks that make playful references to the 8-bit era. Add in iconic characters like Mega Man, Samus Aran, Captain Falcon, Fox McCloud, Animal Crossing’s Villager, Pac-Man, Wii Fit Trainer, Link, Mario himself, and dozens of others, and you’ve got something for pretty much anybody who’s ever loved a video game. The attention to detail in every part of Super Smash Bros. is fantastic, and all of it is delivered at a speedy and smooth 60 frames per second. Mega Man walks using his signature awkward sideways-shuffle, and the new Mario Kart Circuit arena captures the zero-gravity look and feel of a Mario Kart 8 track. Items like the deadly Bullet Bill or POW Block stir up old-school Super Mario Bros. memories while also sending a satisfying wallop to opponents. With so many tiny details and references to observe, it’ll take lots of hours to see everything Smash Wii U has to offer. Excellent moment-to-moment combat is the real jewel of this game, and the many ways it can be played, from the Wii U GamePad to classic GameCube controllers with an adapter, make it a gift that keeps on giving. The action scales incredibly well: two-player duels are tense, while eight players all trying to Smash each other out of the ring is complete chaos. Turning items off removes the random element, turning it into more of a test of skill. But that’s just the beginning.  The constant variety of the multiple modes keeps me playing. Event mode, for instance, makes learning new characters’ moves easy by putting them in playful solo or co-op adventures. One of these is “Keep ‘Em Off the Ship,” in which you play as Falco and go up to smash a squad of parachuting Mr. Game & Watch enemies out of the ring, and it provided me some great training for how to use the speedy character’s aerial attacks. The mission text makes some hilarious references to video game history, but the skills I picked up hold equal value, and the addition of two-player co-op makes it even more fun.  Modes like Classic, Special Orders, and All-Star take a similar approach, using diverse matches, fun scenarios, and specific rules to set up creative encounters, but each allows you to choose the level of risk and reward. Special Orders allow you to spend accumulated Smash coins on special event matches, where winning unlocks another trophy or a handy piece of custom equipment; the higher the difficulty, the better the prizes. However, losing comes at a hefty price torching most (or in some cases all) of the stakes, giving these matches special tension. Nearly every mode of Super Smash Bros. offers a set of unlockable rewards, and the only parts about unlocking them that aren’t satisfying are the awkward menus and, more importantly, the stingy drop rates for custom special moves. Those swappable special moves alter the speed of Mario’s Fireball or the properties of other special attacks, so they’re pretty important and fun to mess with. The prospect of new custom equipment, special moves, beautifully rendered trophies, and more kept me playing for hours, even though Super Smash Bros. didn’t really give me enough direction for how to actually unlock the prizes I wanted. The only mode that’s a snooze is Smash Tour, which is effectively a mediocre virtual board game with too many boring parts. Four players take turns gathering up stat buffs, items, and characters in a build up to a final battle, which is a cool concept, but Smash Tour’s approach distills the essence of this amazing brawler game into painfully short matches full of random elements that just don’t have the same satisfying payoff or feeling of accomplishment. Super Smash Wii U’s online modes offer lots of match types to play with, from tense 1-on-1 showdowns without items, to 2v2 faceoffs in Team Smash, with up to two fighters playing from the same console. Just like in Mario Kart 8, getting friends together can be a little bit of a hassle involving text messages because Nintendo’s system doesn’t allow for notifications. But once you’re all set up, you can launch private matches with friends and unleash characters with customized movesets, or watch other players’ strategies through handy replay and spectator modes. Sadly, eight-player Smash doesn’t make the cut online, but four players is more than enough for a good brawl. This is also the first game to integrate with Nintendo’s new toys-to-life, called amiibo. There are no figures in the box, so this is an extra purchase, but if you do buy in they’ll add another, much smaller avenue of variety to Super Smash Bros. for Wii U. Computer-controlled figure players will stand in as opponents, and each one learns to defend itself as it levels over time. The investment required to reach max level is small (maybe three hours) and having a brutally tuned A.I. to unleash on your friends is fun to watch – but of course, sometimes my amiibo made some questionable decisions. I’ve seen my fully leveled Mario figure wreck opponents, but I’ve also watched in horror as it totally gave away the match. I’m proud of my amiibo, but sometimes it’s like dealing with a child that only listens half the time.

Rare Replay Review  Nearly every aspect of Smash Wii U seems fine-tuned not only to appeal to the nostalgia of long-time Nintendo fans, but also to be accessible to new players. Once they’re hooked,  it draws them in deeper with a set of great modes and tempting rewards. There’s just so much here, and I’ve rarely seen a game with so many enjoyable and replayable ideas in a single package. Playing eight-player matches and classic four-player brawls are only the beginning, and I don’t see a reason to stop playing Super Smash Bros. for Wii U for a long time."
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review	" What's the single most defining characteristic of a Sonic the Hedgehog game? If your answer is ""speed,"" expect to feel cheated about three minutes into Sonic Boom: Rise of Lyric, when a high-velocity sprint through a linear jungle track suddenly gives way to repetitive robot-punching and plodding exploration. It's jarring, and it's an immediate reminder that Rise of Lyric isn’t a traditional Sonic game so much as it’s a licensed platformer based on the Cartoon Network show. Its gameplay more closely resembles an off-brand Ratchet & Clank – and while that doesn't automatically condemn it , Rise of Lyric is so aggressively mediocre that slowing Sonic down is really the least of its sins.  It's still a pretty big sin, though. Rise of Lyric – which tasks Sonic, Knuckles, Amy Rose, and Tails with halting a robot apocalypse engineered by Lyric, a cackling and utterly forgettable cyborg snake – relegates high-speed running to just one of several gameplay types, and pares it down to mostly linear skyways where your input is limited to collecting rings, dodging hazards, and simply watching as you're bounced between jump pads or funneled through loops. These sequences can be awfully pretty (when they're not bogged down by choppy animation or visual clutter), and despite their lack of interactivity, they're a fun, breezy change of pace – as well as the only place Sonic's signature speed is on display. The rest of Rise of Lyric is split into simple brawling, open-world exploration, and linear puzzle-platforming stages that frequently shift to a 2D viewpoint. None of these move faster than jogging speed, but they do let you switch between the four protagonists at will, using their unique abilities to navigate character-specific obstacles. Amy, for example, has a triple-jump that makes her a more agile explorer than Sonic, and she can run and swing on glowing pink balancing beams. Knuckles can climb ruby-encrusted walls, Tails can float and send out little robots to shut down otherwise inaccessible machinery, and Sonic can spin-dash to zoom up curved ramps or bounce between hovering orbs. Rise of Lyric does a decent job of making sure you have plenty of opportunities to use these abilities. The heroes get a lot less distinct during Rise of Lyric's fights, however. Combat is simple; Everyone has a single attack combo, as well as a midair stomp, a charged attack, and an energy tether that can lasso and throw enemies around. The combat's simplicity wouldn't be so bad if it were woven more naturally into exploration; instead, most of it unfolds in Devil May Cry-esque arenas, meaning robots attack in waves and you can't move on until they're all in pieces. It quickly becomes a chore, and usually boils down to either frantically mashing a single button while dodging poorly telegraphed attacks, or laboriously dragging robots to you with the tether (which rarely targeted the enemies I wanted it to) and hurling them off cliffs.  It's not particularly challenging, either. The heroes have a shared pool of rings that act as their collective health meter, and while these are capped at 100, every environment in Rise of Lyric is filled to bursting with the things. Should you actually die, you'll just respawn nearby, with your enemies just as weakened as you left them. This cuts down any potential frustration, but it also strips out any trace of actual difficulty, meaning you're free to simply hurl yourself against enemies until they're all dead. Finally, there’s the open-world gameplay, which consists of two huge hub-world villages. These are fun to explore at first, but apart from item-revealing construction projects and a handful of NPCs who want you to pursue inane side quests (like finding hidden herbs, or activating magical defense towers), they're pretty empty, and crossing their vast expanses of bland scenery quickly gets tedious. Being able to run fast would've been a big help here, but depressingly, it's not even an option. Bringing in a second player makes things a little more fun, and it's handled smartly; one player uses the GamePad's screen, the other gets the TV and a controller, and both players get separate stocks of rings. Interestingly, the two-screen approach lets you simultaneously play through areas where the heroes split up (with player two visible in the background of the GamePad screen), although it doesn't come into play at all during the Team Challenges, a set of separate, local-only multiplayer modes that confine up to four players to one fixed camera angle in enjoyably frantic, combat-focused minigames. These are a definite bright spot, and feature scenarios – like a battle on top of the engines of a continually digging subterranean drill – that are far more imaginative than anything in the story.  Throughout its six-to-eight-hour runtime, Rise of Lyric is further dragged down by nearly every aspect of its presentation. Its heroes animate relatively well, but they also never shut up, continually tossing out banal one-liners that range from cheerful encouragements to excruciating ""not!"" jokes. The script is never ashamed to embrace drab clichés rehashed from seemingly every show aimed at kids (""I know your weakness, Sonic. It's your friends!"" "" They're not my weakness. They're my strength!""). It's also not short on technical issues, beginning with a finicky, sluggish camera and extending to frequently choppy animation, long load times, noticeable hangs during transitions between different areas of open environments, and even occasional crashes. ""Sonic is slow and you play as his friends"" might be one of the most unappealing sentences I've ever written, but it neatly sums up my experience with Rise of Lyric. Its exploration is so-so, its brawling is tedious, its characters are annoying, and the only stages where it feels like a Sonic game are the ones most likely to suffer technical problems. Rise of Lyric isn't fundamentally broken or unplayable; it's just thoroughly disappointing and unpolished, and while it does have some fun to offer, it's fun that's been done better in countless similar games."
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	 Right from the action-packed moments of its fantastic prologue, I couldn't help but notice how much better Bayonetta 2 looks and plays than its predecessor - or most other action games, for that matter. Impressively, Bayonetta 2 just gets better from there. With the style, grace, and precision of a runway model, she sashays, punches, poses, and kicks her way through an outstanding 10-hour campaign full of grand setpieces and deadly angels and demons.  Building on the original Bayonetta’s strengths, Bayonetta's 2 free-flowing combat remains its greatest asset. Each punch, kick, and weapon swing flows comfortably into the next empowering move. Everything moves at a fast and fluid 60 frames-per-second target (it never noticeably dipped), and this sequel feels supercharged thanks to excellent animation, more opportunities to cancel out of attacks mid-move to dodge, and fun new weapons to unlock, like the Rakshasa blades or the Chernabog scythe. Each feels distinct and has its own branching combos that can be mixed and matched to set up different styles of play. Executing combos feels natural, and it's invigorating to pull off long attack strings on a group of enemies. Perfectly timed dodges have a tangible reward thanks to Witch Time, a slow-motion payoff for dodging at the last second that allows me to dig in and devastate angelic foes. Once I factored in the new Umbran Climax - a high-power release of demon-summoning attacks that strike in a wide radius - I had plenty of ways to embarrass the opposition. No matter how large they got (and Bayonetta 2’s enemies get enormous) my attacks could still send them reeling. Bayonetta’s not overpowered, though. Even on normal difficulty, the enemies shouldn’t be underestimated. The dozens of enemy types, from the small flying underlings to the large bosses themselves, have distinct attack patterns and signature tells that demand and reward your attention. Each boss has a cool and unique visual design, and no two behave the same way. The flying boss Valor, whose gold armor gives him the look of an angelic knight, fights much differently than the deadly Urbane, a ground-based foe that wields dual flaming gauntlets.  The constant enemy variety makes me feel like I’m never fighting the same foe for too long or too often. Action gets chaotic, but big, colorful effects help make it clear what’s going on at any given moment: successful last-second dodges set off purple-hued slow-motion moments, while Angelic minions, with the sculptured look of mythic statues, have a shimmering gold effect that signals they’re winding up to attack. Clear visual language like this informs quick decisions, letting me confidently dodge and strike enemies down with a high-powered offense.   The meticulous rating system gave me incentive to aim higher and experiment with new combos and moves. Each chapter rates you based on time played and combo prowess, with penalties to your score for items or continues used. It pushes you to do better with great rewards like score multipliers and extra currency to spend on new techniques, accessories, hilarious Nintendo-themed costumes, and items. Many elements of Bayonetta 2's presentation and mechanics are geared for hardcore action fans, but it attempts to embrace casual newcomers too – with mixed results. The GamePad-focused touch control option uses simple taps, holds, and swipes to send an A.I.-driven Bayonetta into attack. That alternate control scheme is a neat addition, but it doesn’t hold up well with lots of enemies on screen because the camera has trouble keeping up. You’ll have to learn the standard control scheme a few hours in regardless - and you should, because it’s fantastic.   There’s also an online only, scenario-based co-op mode that squeezes a little more value out of Bayonetta 2’s excellent combat. Each one is acquired by completing sections of the main campaign, and they distill combat to smaller area encounters with a group of enemies or even bosses. They’re fun, but it’s all over after just two- or three-minute bursts of action. As a finishing touch, Bayonetta's wicked weaves -- transformations involving powerful demonic accomplishes -- punctuate the end of an action sequence, often skewering enemies in outrageous death traps. They create some of the most extravagant moments, with gruesome enemy-munching sequences. Mashing buttons as a Godzilla-sized demon is turned in into devilish lunchmeat for one of Bayonetta’s minions is a satisfying conclusion after a tense fight. But as much as I enjoy Bayonetta's over-the-top style, and I’m not too put off by her hypersexualized character design, the writing does have a bad habit of occasionally slipping into annoyingly juvenile territory with some bad attempts at humor. I don’t mind some juvenile humor to complement a light-hearted action game, but the jokes just lean on foul-mouthed punchlines and silly character tropes, and the sequences go on for way longer than they should. On the other hand, the writing has some good high points, like how it positions The Masked Lumen Sage as an excellent foil to Bayonetta. The times I fought him felt tense, as he firmly stood toe-to-toe with my heroine’s high-powered abilities, summoning his own angelic helpers to counter my own.  The excellent combat of Bayonetta 2 is boosted by superb art direction and pacing, both of which make Bayonetta 1 look poor by comparison. Missions never lets up, presenting more enemy types to fight across urban cityscapes, quaint mountain cities, and stylized interpretations of Heaven and Hell. Level designs give you room to take advantage of Bayonetta’s shapeshifting abilities, so you can charge through a platforming area as a panther or swim through underwater sections as a sea serpent. It’s also useful in combat as well. By double-tapping the dodge button I can quickly transform and close the space between opponents I fight on the ground, in the air, and underwater.  Every aspect of Bayonetta 2 feels polished and focused. At times, the writing feels ridiculous, but I still love how it plays. The superb pacing and combat are just that good. By the end I was convinced: This sequel builds on everything that made the original great, and delivers one of the most satisfying action games I've played.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/17/hyrule-warriors-review	 Hyrule Warriors isn't a traditional Legend of Zelda-style adventure, but it manages to work well as a Zelda-themed power trip. This all-action spin-off ditches the traditional dungeons and puzzles in favor of big, Dynasty Warriors-style battles, but the layers of Zelda fanservice managed to keep my attention for its 10-hour adventure. Aside from its basic but entertainingly indulgent story that ties three Zelda games together with an interdimensional crossover, Hyrule Warriors is all about fighting. The process of killing your way through enemy armies is mostly simple and repetitive, but what keeps it from getting too boring too fast are devastating special attacks that launch enemies into the air. This was especially fun whenever a lot of enemies would appear on screen. It’s genuinely satisfying to make them fly and watch the number of simultaneous KOs flash on screen.   It should be noted that few enemies on these vast battlefields ever stood toe-to-toe with me for more than a few seconds. But as with the Dynasty Warriors games, that’s the point: You play the role of a hero with the power to single-handedly turn the tide of a conflict between lesser soldiers. It genuinely feels great to be stronger than 80 percent of the enemies on screen, and to watch the battle change based on which skirmishes you choose to fight. Whether capturing enemy bases or fighting tougher mid-bosses, I always felt like there was something I needed to do or needed to slay, even if the actual act of slaying is pretty much the same time and time again. The other big thing Hyrule Warriors has going for it is a diverse playable roster of 13 familiar Zelda characters including Link, Princess Zelda, Ganondorf, and more. Each  has unique weapons and abilities - a heavy-hitter like Ocarina of Time’s Darunia swings a mighty hammer to crush foes on the field; Sheik, on the other hand, uses a mix of quick strikes and a harp with elemental properties. Unlocking and switching between characters keeps the action interesting a little longer. Some surprising depth materializes out of the crafting system, but you have to dig for it a little. By replaying stages and farming materials, I could build useful equipment to augment character combos, weapons, and special abilities as the in game Bazaar. Creating special badges makes a character more resilient. You can also synthesize cool new weapons at the Smithy and carry over handy traits that add strength or magic properties. It’s handy that you can spend rupees to level up weaker characters, because I felt encouraged to experiment without needing to grind each one for experience.   Boss monsters are the main area of Hyrule Warriors fan-service-fueled trip that doesn’t translate well to the Dynasty Warriors framework. They do offer an impressive bit of scale, and in keeping with the Zelda series, each boss has an exploitable weakness. But these oversized foes feel like weak homages to their Zelda inspiration. In the Legend of Zelda series, a big part of the epic boss fight design is their smartly laid out maps, which require some situational awareness. The battle against King Dodongo in Ocarina of Time, for example, takes place in a closed-off chamber with a pool of lava in the center, forcing you to use a narrow dry path to avoid getting run over by the beast or fried by the lava. Dropped into the wide-open battlefields of Hyrule Warriors, Dodongo and the other bosses come across as generic damage sponges. Overall, Hyrule Warriors just isn’t much of a challenge, and even turning up the difficulty doesn’t do anything for it. On higher settings, the average mini-boss just inflicts more damage and requires double the hits to vanquish, but doesn’t change up his attack pattern. It becomes a monotonous chore to finish one off.   After I completed the campaign, I got a few more hours of entertainment out of the clever Adventure mode, which repurposes a detailed recreation of the original Legend of Zelda’s map for a clever item hunt. Most of the secrets littered throughout this 8-bit map all tie to existing ones from the NES original game, so I had to reach back to my memories of the original game to find them (a handy compass will unveil secrets if you can’t remember). Using items like bombs or candle flames unlocks a cool new prize, and claimed by engaging in a standard Hyrule Warriors battle on that tile. Since completing missions in either mode will unlock more secret weapons, characters, and styles of combat to enjoy, it gave me a good reason to stick with Hyrule Warriors a little longer. However,  the local-only multiplayer mode is a huge disappointment because of very noticeable performance problems. Extending a second player’s perspective to the GamePad means the resolution takes an awful hit, creating jaggy visuals that would look at home on Wii. Even so, things intermittently slow down a lot when lots of enemies join the mix. Surprisingly, Hyrule Warriors does a good job of tying together the combat of Dynasty Warriors and the revered characters and lore of the Legend of Zelda series in a way that makes me feel powerful in a world I love.  Character customization adds unique flavor to the simple combat, and the satisfying weapons, rewards, and story make it a fun alternative to the typically serious Zelda games. It’s just a shame you can’t share the action with a friend without significant slowdown.
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/08/wii-sports-club-review	 Wii Sports Club proves that, almost eight years later, pantomiming sports gestures in your living room is still fun. Featuring online-enabled and MotionPlus-enhanced versions of the five original Wii Sports games, Wii Sports Club stands above its predecessor thanks to new and tweaked content.  In a lot of ways, Wii Sports Club feels like a remake of the original Wii Sports. I hesitate to call it an “HD remake” because it is filled with bad textures, boring backgrounds, and a noticeable lack of anti-aliasing. Bowling, Tennis, Boxing, Baseball, and Golf return with all-new training minigames, the ability to play online, and, in some cases, new GamePad functionality. Each sport also makes use of the now-standard Wii MotionPlus, allowing for greater control. With a flick or twist of the wrist, you can get precise spin on your bowling ball or hook your golf ball into the blowing wind. Even having played plenty of Wii Sports Resort, which introduced MotionPlus, I’m impressed with how much better the original Wii Sports games play now. A few of the sports see marked improvements over their Wii Sports counterparts. Baseball now features a more robust pitching and fielding mechanic thanks to the GamePad. Using the second screen, you line up your throw with the batter’s box, choose a pitch, and then adjust the speed. If the batter hits a fly ball, you’ll need to move the GamePad around in real-space to line your glove up with the ball to make the out. While there’s still no ability to handle and throw grounders (they are automatic outs, singles, doubles, or triples), having more control over fielding and pitching makes Baseball more balanced and competitive. Golf, on the other hand, moves closer to emulating the actual sport. Placing the GamePad on the floor, the ball is shown as if it’s resting on a tee. With the direction the ball will travel and the power of the shot displayed there on the floor, I found that with just a few practice swings I became fairly accurate in my swings. Combined with the ability to twist the remote mid-swing to hook the ball, Golf winds up being a fun simulation that’s only lacking the weight of using an actual club (and a mischievous gopher). This move toward more realism does dampen the ability to let newcomers easily jump in at a party, but regular visitors to the virtual links will be rewarded. Unfortunately, there is no saving Boxing. As with the original Wii Sports, these matches wind up feeling chaotic, unresponsive, and mundane. While using a MotionPlus Wii Remote in each hand does allow for better tracking as you block punches to either side of your head, throwing hooks and uppercuts often doesn’t register correctly. Frustrated with the inability to play with finesse, matches often boiled down to throwing my arms around wildly and hoping for the best. Besides Boxing, each of Wii Sports Club’s games are still a blast to play locally. Online play, however, provides some very glaring issues. The slower-moving games, like Bowling and Golf, become an absolute bore thanks to a lack of in-game communication. With no voicechat, you’re resigned to using (and often spamming) a small handful of generic phrases like “soooo close” and “nice!” as you watch complete strangers bowl. With a rather generous time limit for each turn, a game of bowling with four players winds up feeling like an eternity. Meanwhile, without faile, every game of Golf I played featured someone who skipped the tutorial. The rest of our Miis had to stand there, blank-faced, as the novice continually knocked the ball out of bounds on the very first hole until, mercifully, he was disqualified until the next one. To make matters worse, it is impossible to quit an online game in progress; the only way to release yourself from the torment is to shut the Wii U down completely.  Thankfully, these issues don’t extend to the action-focused Tennis and Baseball. Tennis, in particular, became a favorite in my home. With online doubles matches, my wife and I cheered and yelled while performing backhand, forehand and overhand smash gestures to eliminate our random opponents. Even playing without a co-op partner, Tennis is a lot of fun and is easily the most rewarding of the five sports to play online. Wii Sports Club mostly succeeds in refining the classic Wii launch title thanks to smart use of the GamePad and Wii MotionPlus. While the inclusion of online play creates some issues with the slower-moving sports, it’s still a fun addition for Tennis and Baseball. Whether you want to play casually or competitively, Wii Sports Club proves that the core Wii Sports experience wasn’t just lightning in a bottle.
Marc Nix	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	 What I knew before anything else about One Piece Unlimited World Red was that this is a blindingly vibrant game. Seeing the Thousand Sunny pirate ship sit like a jewel in the mouth of the cove drew me to its comical, high-flying action. And it needed that good first impression, because Unlimited World Red pulls off fighting better than it does adventuring, and all the color and humor helped me enjoy myself through its weaker moments and get to the better parts. Its self-contained (yet highly referential) storyline and accessible brawler combat makes for a decent place to dip a toe into the waters of One Piece. This gameplay mixture is a difficult balance: too much RPG and you might be worn out by all the button slamming; too little RPG and you have maxed out your stats before you've gotten your fill of the action. Unlimited World Red does what it can to keep you going before combat fatigue eventually sets in. It helps break bad habits of cheesing repetitive moves or relying on one stat-maxed hero with quest goals that require you to use all nine characters. Bonuses are also given for mixing up your moves. A parry system (ala the Batman Arkham games) makes defense a factor in the fight, although the one-button blocking technique is too loose to feel rewarding after I’d sharpened my skills for a few hours. Instead of a versus mode (which is missed as a multiplayer option, as the local-only co-op feature is negligible,) there is an extensive Battle Coliseum side-game which tosses you a good variety of recycled boss battles and survival challenges. And although the Fishing and Catching minigames are clumsy, about halfway through the Story mode you will unlock a bridge to what I like to call “Minigame Island” -- a place that offers a few better (if still minor) distractions. Unlimited World Red is never extraordinarily difficult, but some quests do set up tough goals to meet, and there is a more difficult second quest to play through as well. Brawling gameplay is plenty accessible, but Unlimited World Red hits rough waters when the overdone RPG element comes into play. It is designed to add depth, but instead piles on padding and confusion. Despite pop-up tutorial features that try to explain all of the many mechanisms, there were whole chunks of features that I never thought to touch until I was nearly finished with the 10 hour main quest. Good luck trying to keep straight the difference between Skill Words, Item Words, or Custom Words (all of which are different from “Strong Voice” commands, by the by.) I spent hours smacking desert plants looking to find the crafting ingredient “Juicy Cactus Pulp” before realizing that this item was an unlabeled reward in a side-quest. There are hundreds of collectibles and craftables and junk to go fetch, but oddly, you’re never actually unlocking any new combat moves, just supplementing the stats. Strange design decisions and unclear stat labels make Unlimited World Red a much stranger and longer game than it needs to be.  If you start to get tired of the fetching and the fighting, however, take some time to look around. Developer Ganbarion has captured the anime look of One Piece with a game engine saturated in color in every version of Unlimited World Red we tested (a Vita copy was not available for review.) The design style uses the glossier modern One Piece look, and every version, down to the diminutive 3DS platform (which neglects to use the stereoscopic 3D display, but does offer the same world layout and gameplay as the HD versions,) offers huge levels that can pack several enemies and massive bosses on screen without framerate hiccups. and I didn't see any of the draw-in issues that have been a problem in previous One Piece Unlimited games (through waves of enemies do pop-in, by design.) Unlimited World Red uses the Japanese voices and subtitles in the place of a dub, which is a benefit to hardcore fans, although it may take some getting used to (and some reading) for those expecting the Funimation voice cast. Attention paid to authentic graphics and sound are particularly appreciable for long-time fans, as the mysterious storyline reaches back through the history of One Piece in order to allow many of the Straw Hat Pirates’ vanquished foes and friends to appear. One Piece Unlimited World Red offers simple but refined brawler play, and boasts attractive anime-styled scenery throughout, though it still eventually runs out of tricks to conceal the fact that it’s a repetitive beat-em-up. The only thing close to a puzzle to be found is the tricky goals to be met in tougher side-quests, and those still require the same combat and exploration skills. But with a mix of varied characters, as well as three difficulty options and a slew of side-missions and Battle Coliseum challenges, Unlimited World Red is not short on ways to extend your play.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/01/transformers-rise-of-the-dark-spark-wii-u-review	 A Transformers game really only has to deliver on two simple things: make it fun to transform, and make it fun to destroy robots. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark is a dud on both of those fronts, and it throws in a confusing story to boot. Worse, the Wii U version doesn't even have the online co-op that slightly redeems this game on other platforms.  Rise of the Dark Spark has a simple storyline about the bad guys wanting to find the Dark Spark and the good guys trying to stop them. That should make for a straightforward campaign, but a few factors derail the plot. Whereas previous Transformers games, War for Cybertron and Fall of Cybertron, had separate Autobot and Decepticon campaigns or at least transitioned between factions coherently, Rise of the Dark Spark’s 14-mission campaign switches sides without much reason or notice, and unevenly at that. In the middle of the Decepticons capturing the important relic, you jump to an Autobot mission where they're on the hunt, and after the halfway point, the Decepticon's side of the story just stops being told as the Autobots march towards their inevitable victory. The switches are jarring enough that you might forget which side you're on at more than one point during the early stages. What’s even more confusing is that in order to tie into the concurrently released Transformers: Age of Extinction movie, Rise of the Dark Spark's entire cast sports the same faux-gritty style of the films, where little separates the factions besides a tiny logo. Aside from the always-game Peter Cullen reprising his role as Optimus Prime, there's few noteworthy performances from the rest of the cast. Jazz tries to be the comic relief, but has nothing funny to say, Drift counterbalances his unique design by being exceedingly dull, and the Decepticons only come in two flavors: cackling underlings and brooding leaders. The dull audio and level design extends outward, as the soundtrack is a grating Hans Zimmer-style bombast mixed with dubstep, while the stages alternate towards bland, dilapidated Earth cities and samey labyrinth outer-space bases. The few times Rise of the Dark Spark dares to venture outside on other planets it makes for memorable diversions, but those levels are rare exceptions. Shooting is serviceable, largely due to a pretty impressive suite of weapons. Each of the 20 guns you wield in robot form has a very distinct style, from standards like the semi-automatic and shotgun to more esoteric ideas like an electric beam that chains between enemies, a slime cannon that slows down and poisons enemies, and Dead Space-like blade and bolo shooters. However, the enemies you'll use them on aren't much fun to fight with. With the exception of the uniquely shielded “Titan” Decepticon troops, enemies have few intelligent tactics. The ones that lack overpowered weapons will perform extreme evasive maneuvers that are doubly frustrating, since you usually need to clear out all enemies in particular sections to progress. Mindless, unsatisfying melee strikes don’t add anything. There are special attacks unique to each Transformer, but they’re either overpowered in cases like Drift's sword slice, or useless, like Sharpshot's cloaking ability.  The nail in the coffin is that vehicular transformations fail to spice up the combat. If the Transformer you're playing as turns into a car, you can expect clunky turning and a dire lack of a sense of speed, even if you engage both boost and turbo; why there are two separate speed boost buttons is a mystery. The air-based transformations aren't as bad, but since there's no radar, tracking down flying enemies is an annoying game of hide and seek. And for some reason there’s only one Dinobot and one Insecticon transformation during the campaign, but plenty to choose from exclusively in multiplayer. Seems like a waste. Rise of the Dark Spark on Wii U is by far the worst version available. While the visuals are at the same level as the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (meaning muddy textures, jaggy character models, and pretty awful pop-in on buildings and complicated textures), the Wii U version lacks the biggest redeeming value of every other non-Nintendo platform: the multiplayer Escalation mode. Furthermore the GamePad support is incredible anemic, as it simply mirrors what's being shown on your TV screen; there's no touchpad usage (not even for menus) or additional info to glean on the screen. Transformers: Rise of the Dark Spark on the Wii U has some cool weapons befitting the bots, but little else of note. The bland campaign is a slog with uneven difficulty, vehicle transformations and combat are largely unsatisfying, the Game Pad support is nearly nonexistent, and the multiplayer mode available on the PC and all other consoles is unfortunately omitted. Rise of the Dark Spark is a bad Transformers game to begin with, and the corners cut on the Wii U make it the worst one of all.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	 The gaming industry is attached to an invisible pendulum. In recent years, that pendulum has noticeably swung towards an appreciation of the old school, with pixel art, grueling difficulty, and seemingly ancient ideas made new again. Yacht Club's Shovel Knight is one such product of the pendulum swing, though it doesn't fall into the trap all too common with likeminded games. It isn't just some throwaway cash-in or half-baked concept designed to take advantage of the zeitgeist. It doesn't just look the part. It expertly plays the part, making it perhaps the best retro-inspired game since Mega Man 9 and 10. Shovel Knight is a clever, well-made, and thoughtful amalgamation of a cascade of NES classics. Its gameplay, bosses, and level designs are inspired by Mega Man. Its charming world map, with its roving parts, limited non-linearity, and inconveniently sealed-off segments will be recognizable to anyone who has played Mario 3. Its combat contains a significant dash of Duck Tales. Its hub towns, inventory and money systems -- as well as its cast of NPCs to interact with -- represent a hybrid between Zelda II and Faxanadu, while its sub-weapon system is an ode to Castlevania and Ninja Gaiden. The real beauty of Shovel Knight isn't that it's a clearly worded love letter to the storied NES era; it's that it drew inspiration from nothing but great NES games.  Then again, what makes Shovel Knight truly stand out is that while its lineage is clear, it's still its own game with its own distinct personality, art style, soundtrack, and plot. It isn't a flagrant rip-off. It doesn't retread identical paths already worn-in by what inspired it. It's merely informed by what made those old classics tick, with a willingness to take and use what worked. It's powered by a love of what was, yet it isn't just another Mega Man, Mario, or Castlevania. It's Shovel Knight through and through, a product of hindsight and 25 years of distance between itself and the era it actually belongs in. At the start of the adventure, we're introduced to Shovel Knight's rudimentary story, one revolving around our brave protagonist and his partner, the complementary Shield Knight. After some unfortunate events, Shovel Knight and Shield Knight are separated as an evil sorcerer known only as the Enchantress takes over the kingdom they're sworn to protect. Helping the Enchantress is her so-called Order of No Quarter, a group of eight devious knights that would easily fit in among Mega Man's roster of Robot Masters, each with his own themed stage and arsenal of attacks. Like those aforementioned Robot Masters, the Order of No Quarter is rife with amazing designs. I was especially partial to Tinker Knight, Treasure Knight, and Propeller Knight, but in reality, I loved all eight designs, from King Knight and Specter Knight to Plague Knight and Mole Knight. After a brief intro stage that teaches players Shovel Knight's simplistic control scheme -- move, jump, and attack -- we're thrust onto a map that's cut from the same cloth as Mario 3's eight worlds. The kingdom has been seized by the Enchantress and her men, and slowly but surely, Shovel Knight must defeat her eight protectors as he moves through stage after stage. Better yet, the adventure is occasionally interrupted as ever-moving enemies cross paths with you on the map itself, just like the Hammer and Boomerang Bros. would 25 years ago. Its straight-forwardness is, like everything else in the game, a product of its many inspirations. It's accessible and simple to understand, especially for those of us who grew up with an NES controller fused to our hands.  Gameplay in Shovel Knight is fluid and responsive. It's not quite as tight as Mega Man, but it's also not as nuanced and heavy as Castlevania or as twitchy and fast as Ninja Gaiden. Armed with a shovel -- as his name suggests -- Shovel Knight can bash enemies with a quick slash, or he can jump on top of them with a pogo-like attack ripped straight out of the timeless Capcom classic Duck Tales. Better yet, Shovel Knight's implement isn't only used as a weapon, but also as a tool. He can dig up treasures with it, eliminate blocks of sand, rock, and other minerals to clear paths, and, once you earn enough loot, you can even purchase useful upgrades for it that make it more powerful. One extra useful attack allows Shovel Knight to shoot a pulse of energy across the screen, but only if his health is full, Zelda-style. Speaking of loot, earning cash and spending it is an important component of Shovel Knight. Virtually every enemy you encounter and hidden cavern you explore is chock-full of valuables, and you can use them to purchase essential weapon, armor, health, and mana upgrades. And then there are the sub-weapons that are found in hidden nooks throughout the game, such as a wand that shoots fire. My favorite subweapons, however, were ones directly inspired by Castlevania, like an anchor that's thrown in an arc, similar to the Axe used in Simon and Trevor Belmont's adventures. You may need those upgrades and sub-weapons for the adventure's more difficult sections, but Shovel Knight brings a balanced difficulty that's somewhat challenging, yet never insurmountable. It provided me about as much challenge as Mega Man 2 did (the easiest Mega Man game by a mile), and it never feels overly punitive. Part of me is actually disappointed by this, as I adore a good old-school platformer challenge, but I also understand the approach, especially to attract younger or less experienced gamers that didn't grow up during such punishing times.  You can actively make it a little tougher, though, because you can actually destroy checkpoints to earn a ton of loot. It's a clever risk-reward system that replaces lives and continues, though it can easily backfire on you if you aren't careful. Worse yet, each time you die you lose money, and you can only earn it back by retrieving it where you perished. Shovel Knight has found its own way to reward people who play carefully and deliberately while punishing those who rush and are careless, even if it's not even remotely as archaic and ruthless as, say, Castlevania III. Stages introduce new components in the same way old games did; with a wink and a nod, one chance to get it right with no hazards around you, and no tutorial. Then, you're thrown into the fire. I found some of the stages to be a bit devoid of an enemy presence at times -- I would have preferred more foes to fight more often -- but Shovel Knight instead opts for a DuckTales-inspired slant, with fewer enemies and more platforming feats to overcome. The non-boss enemies that do appear run the gamut from cute and well-designed to weak and uninspired; indeed, my biggest disappointment came from a lack of diversity between some enemies and a propensity to palette swap too often, especially with two enemies in particular -- a knight and a wizard -- both of whom you will encounter with regularity. But the Order of No Quarter and brilliant cast of NPCs more than make up for these minor design deficiencies. And even with some disappointing enemies, the stages themselves are diverse and brilliantly designed, and always accompanied by fresh, retro-themed chiptunes. There were so many stop-and-look (and stop-and-listen) moments that it would be hard to recount them all, but I always loved how Shovel Knight's parallax scrolling introduced and then hid awesome background imagery, especially the Enchantress' castle, which seems to always be sitting ominously in the background. From an underwater stage that recalls Bubble Man's level in Mega Man 2 to a factory inspired by Metal Man's level from the same game, there's a lot to marvel at, both in the foreground and background, from brilliantly-colored northern lights-filled skies and lush forests to eerie, abandoned graveyards and dark, dingy dungeons. Aesthetically, Shovel Knight is perpetually easy on the eyes and ears.   PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita Versions The PlayStation versions of Shovel Knight build upon the same incredible gameplay, challenge, and style that earned its place as one of our favorite games of 2014, and add even more to love. The presence of God of War’s Kratos as a hidden boss is a fantastic addition. Battling him is tense, and earning his Armor of Chaos adds a neat twist to Shovel Knight’s traversal and combat, and make playing through the adventure actually feel fresh again. The Cross-Buy and Cross-Save nature of Shovel Knight on Sony platforms makes it quick and easy to hop between your PS3, PS4, and PlayStation Vita, all of which provide great homes for the 8-bit visuals and audio. I absolutely love Shovel Knight. It doesn't only understand what retro gamers want; it also understands exactly what it is, copping plentiful inspiration from the past while forming it all into its own game. At seven or eight hours long your first time through (and a New Game+ mode once you beat it), it lasts longer than your typical throwback, and all of that time is well-spent, whether you're getting through a new stage, going back to an old one to grind for money to buy upgrades, or exploring its many secrets. It plays brilliantly, looks stunning, and sounds great. Shovel Knight is my favorite game of 2014 so far, and a true testament to the power of the old-school. Whether you were weaned on an NES like I was, or don't yet know what you missed in a time before you were born, Shovel Knight is an absolute must-play.
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/08/1001-spikes-review	" Are you impatient? Easily frustrated? 1001 Spikes is not for you. An uncompromisingly difficult throwback to 8-bit platformers, 1001 Spikes looks like an NES game and feels like being repeatedly kicked in the teeth. As Indiana Jones-alike Aban Hawkins, you've got 1,001 lives to spend delving through an ancient, trap-filled temple – and you'll likely need every last one of them (and more) if you plan to make it to the end. It's a trip worth taking, as the retro aesthetic hides a huge assortment of inventive challenges made more fun and interesting by the precision it takes to overcome them – but it's a brutal one.  Death comes quickly and frequently, often from places that looked safe seconds before; you might finally make it past a seemingly impassable gauntlet of spike traps and dart-blowing statues after 50 attempts, for example, only to be crushed by a surprise falling block just inches from the exit. 1001 Spikes loves to play tricks like that – and it has no mid-level checkpoints, so slip-ups get you thrown back to the start to attempt all their challenges again. And forget about relying on past experience to get you through new obstacles, because each level is a uniquely shaped gem of absurd difficulty, each hidden trap has a distinct behavior, and some challenges can take hundreds of attempts to squeeze past successfully. For all its toughness, however, 1001 Spikes' clever design – which forced me to continually re-think my approach while keeping victory tantalizingly just out of reach – always kept me going for just one more try. (Actually, dozens of tries.) In each level, I experienced three distinct phases: Immediate dread at the sight of corridors lined with rolling boulders, leaping scorpions, or spinning blades; death-filled experimentation as I found a path through them; and endless repetition of the same carefully timed leaps, high jumps, and knife throws so that I could repeat phases one and two while dealing with whatever fresh hell waited in the next part of the level. Things that seemed impossible at first became routine and encoded into muscle memory after 10 or so deaths, and it rarely took very long to figure out what I needed to do. Nailing the timing and precision needed to actually do it was an uphill battle, of course, but part of what makes 1001 Spikes so addictive is that once a solution becomes clear, finishing the level becomes irresistible – and if you can pull it off, it's because you mastered that thing. You own it. And for me, the palpable sense of accomplishment and relief that came with actually completing a level was always enough to make me push ahead into the next one. As a helpful talking mouse at the beginning says, ""the harder the journey, the greater the joy of success.""  If you're especially frustrated with a given level, 1001 Spikes has a very non-old-school feature: you can elect to simply skip ahead to the next one. This may seem self-defeating, but the feature is clearly meant for beginners, with the catch being that skipping levels locks off the final stages of the Ukampa Temple – and, in turn, the entire second half of the campaign, during which the level-skip feature is disabled. Only by going back and repeating the unfinished levels can you hope to forge ahead; fortunately, you can freely revisit them from the world map. There's more to 1001 Spikes than the 61 brilliantly grueling levels in its story mode – which, by the way, can be played in co-op with a friend. It’s something that doesn't necessarily make them any easier, but does make them more fun. Collecting the gold skulls hidden in each level unlocks a host of bonuses, including new playable characters assembled from other indie games. Using them lets you take advantage of new abilities — Tempura of the Dead's President Thompson has a double-jump and a submachine gun, for example, while Aban's sister Tina can cling to walls — but they each have to start a separate campaign from the beginning, which limits their campaign usefulness to making repeat playthroughs more interesting. They're great in the arcade modes, though, which let up to four (local-only) players compete to collect coins (which can buy even more extras from an unlockable shop). The first mode, a chaotic, Smash Bros.-style smack-'em-up called The Golden Vase, lets players compete to beat coins out of the titular magic urn, is open from the start, and it's fun for a few minutes at a stretch. The unlockable modes – ""The Tower of Nannar"" and ""The Lost Levels"" – are a bit more interesting, delivering mini-campaigns with new levels that are perfectly playable solo, but more enjoyable with friends along.   PlayStation 4 Version The PS4 and Vita versions are sold on PSN as a package deal, meaning they're arguably the best deal if you have access to both platforms. The PS4 version is identical to the PC and Wii U versions, with a couple of exceptions: it plays sounds through the controller’s speaker, and it includes a Nathan Drake-inspired Adventure Aban skin for the arcade modes, which lets him cling to ledges and shoot a pistol. The skin is unlocked from the start, alongside the clear homages to Castlevania's Simon Belmont and Ghosts 'n' Goblins' Sir Arthur found in other versions.   PlayStation Vita Version The Vita version lacks any multiplayer features and cuts The Golden Vase mode entirely (slightly disappointing, as it's useful for farming lots of coins in a hurry, but understandable). What remains plays identically to the other versions, features the PS4’s Adventure Aban skin, and looks vibrant on the handheld's screen.   Wii U Version Not to be outdone by the PS4 version, the Wii U edition comes with its own custom arcade-mode skin for Aban: the Mario-inspired Mr. Video Game, which comes complete with appropriate music and a fireball attack.   3DS version The 3DS version is easily the weakest of the bunch; not only does it lack multiplayer and The Golden Vase, but the smaller screen makes it tougher to spot some of the deadlier features camouflaged throughout 1001 Spikes' levels (and for the record, I played on a 3DS XL). Turning on 3D is a little disorienting, and even when it's off, the animation gets visibly (and shockingly) choppy when levels scroll. It's otherwise the same as the other versions and includes the Mr. Video Game skin, but it’s not an ideal way to play.   While obviously not meant for a broad, easily discouraged audience, 1001 Spikes' elegantly devious level design and endless string of ""oh, so close!"" deaths help it succeed at what it sets out to do: deliver a nightmarish degree of challenge while remaining just fun and interesting enough to keep beleaguered players forging ahead. At times it becomes a mind-numbing slog, as you're reduced to performing the same rote set of actions for hours until you perfect the one jump or dodge that's holding you back. The reward is a sense of mastery, but the price can be awfully steep, making this a true test of skill – and patience."
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/mario-kart-8-review	 Mario Kart 8 is a beautiful, fun kart racer that introduces sound new ideas to Nintendo’s 22-year old franchise. While it doesn't reach Double Dash-levels of risk and experimentation, Mario Kart 8 builds on the series' most essential aspects better than any of its predecessors. Twisting U-turns, a blistering sense of speed, skillful track designs, robust tournament and online features, and gorgeous graphics fall into lockstep all at once. The end result shouldn't come as a surprise: Mario Kart 8 is the king of the mascot kart circuit, and it gave me hours of enjoyment.  Right from the starting line, Nintendo’s emphasis on re-tuning Mario Kart 8 in a meaningful way is apparent, and everything moves at a faster pace. Characters and vehicle customization parts unlock quickly, Lakitu helps you recover faster, and new items like the Piranha Plant and Boomerang Flower make for useful additions without throwing off Mario Kart’s delicate balance. And finally, Blue Shell-haters rejoice: the new Super Horn stops the much-maligned comeback mechanic dead in its tracks, allowing skill to prevail more often than ever before. The single best improvement in Mario Kart 8 are the subtle, yet ultimately satisfying antigravity transformations. They set up visually impressive moments while introducing a unique new mechanic to the race. Bumping nearby racers while in anti-grav can give your opponent a speed boost though, so you have to consider the best potential angle to slam into them so that you’re the only one who benefits. Nailing a perfect bump after a tricky S-curve delivered a satisfying feeling of accomplishment. It’s surprising to see such a potentially chaotic idea turned into a nuanced mechanic. Mario Kart 8’s creative track designs carefully factor antigravity in without overusing it. Some tracks, like Wario Stadium, use it to great effect, but retro tracks like Donut Plains 3 rely on good old-fashioned kart racing skills. The careful layout of boost pads and item boxes provide plenty of opportunities to make comebacks without it feeling cheap or unearned. The deceptively simple shortcuts often felt risky, making me weigh my options mid-race depending on how I was doing rather than blindly jumping into the alternate routes ahead. The roster tops off at 30 characters, and offers a wide selection of mascots to choose from, including the amazing Koopa kids. However, the overload of babies in this installment floods the roster with smaller racers that feel too similar to their big brother (or sister) counterparts. Overall, the list is great but more obscure characters like Dry Bones or Nabbit would’ve been welcome additions.  Mario Kart 8 offers a bunch of options to play. Single and two-player split-screen races unfolded at a stunning 60 frames-per-second without a hiccup. Three and four-player local competitive races halved the framerate to 30 fps, but it’s an acceptable loss when the racing looks and plays this well. Mario Kart 8's graphics are some of the best I've seen in a game made by Nintendo.  Each racer, kart combination, and track showcased expert art direction right down to the tiny treads on the tires. Online mode supports up to 12-players, and Nintendo gets a lot of mileage out of Mario Kart 8’s basic online features. It’s easy to join races, setup tournaments, and even upload highlight videos to YouTube, but once again, Nintendo’s den mother attitude rears its head: Chat is restricted to lobbies with friends only. There’s no option to invite friends into a game, and Mario Kart 8 also doesn't provide message notifications. This is seriously disappointing because you have to use outside means to coordinate friends-only races. These omissions often make Mario Kart 8 feel like a fancy import Ferrari with an old ham radio built into the dashboard.  There’s a few other small disappointments in Mario Kart 8 as well. The GamePad always mirrors what’s on the television instead of splitting players into two separately rendered screens. Battle Mode probably suffers the most egregiously of all though. The arenas from previous versions are out, and the newly modified racetracks Nintendo replaced them with don’t feel differentiated enough from the standard tracks. It basically just adds three balloons to standard races. Ultimately, these changes have made what used to be a fun distraction into something completely forgettable. For a racing game about constantly plowing forward to the finish line, I was surprised by how well Mario Kart 8 also nails the tiniest details. Mario Kart TV’s simple editing suite let me tweak highlight reels, and re-watch my most memorable performances. As I watched clips in slow motion, I was amazed by how much texture detail I had missed while I was tearing up the track. Mario Kart 8 is the best kart racing game Nintendo has made in a long time. It strikes a careful balance between refining old ideas while introducing fresh new ones. Admittedly, its gorgeous graphics and jazzy orchestrated soundtrack bolster its presentation, but you’re getting a lot more than just looks with this one – although I spent an awful lot of time gawking at the details in slow-motion, the fast and furious pace of racing with friends both locally and online is what really kept me coming back.
Samuel Claiborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/23/nes-remix-2-review	" In my review of NES Remix, I said the frantic collection of microgames and mashups based on the 80s NES library was a more entertaining way to revisit classic games than just downloading the ROMs from the Virtual Console. This doesn't hold true for NES Remix 2, simply because the masterpieces it riffs on, such as Super Mario Bros. 3 and Punch-Out!!, are absolutely worth playing and replaying on their own. But NES Remix 2 is still a perfectly fun way to revisit classic games, and its especially good at introducing them to the uninitiated for the first time. NES Remix 2 ""remixes"" a dozen mostly amazing, era-defining games, like Super Mario Bros. 3, Metroid, and Zelda 2: The Adventure of Link. Unlike NES Remix, which includes a few annoying games like Tennis, Clu-Clu Land, and Pinball, NES Remix 2 has only one dud in the bunch: Wario's Woods (a puzzle game with complicated, confusing controls). NES Remix 2's action is split into two parts: There are ""challenges,"" which throw you in the middle of a game and ask you to complete a task, and ""remixes"" which combine elements of multiple games, or modify games with new graphics and other elements. Though they are based on some of my favorite games of all time, these challenges, while always charming, are sometimes dull, perhaps due to my (admittedly abnormal) familiarity the original games – I've played the source games in this collection dozens or hundreds of times.  I was able to tear through the challenges for Punch-Out!! in just a few minutes because I've known the boxers' tells by heart for two decades. Exploiting Piston Honda's eye wiggle is pretty much part of my genetic makeup. Similarly, I could probably remake Super Mario Bros. 2 or 3 from memory given enough time and a working knowledge of 1980s game development, so challenges involving grabbing coins or beating bosses were not very engaging. Other challenges sets were much more enjoyable. NES Remix 2 does a great job of revealing the overlooked, clever design of the much more difficult, Japanese-only Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels. A challenge will present you with giant, gaping chasms, peppered with an occasional brick, that seem impossible to cross. Armed with the knowledge that you can treat any challenge in NES Remix 2 like a speed run, you can time your jumps just right you'll find yourself flying from one single block to another, and then to the flag. Some challenge sets, like Zelda 2, Kid Icarus, and Metroid, serve more as an abridged version of long, involved games: You get a whirlwind tour of secrets, boss fights and even get to see the endings. It's nostalgic for some, and a good tutorial for others – and those people should definitely try all of these games after finishing NES Remix 2.  NES Remix 2's remixes offer a taste of the first NES Remix's greater difficulty, but lack some of the novelty of the first batch. I'm a sucker for crossovers, like busting Mario bricks with Samus's arm cannon or Link's Sword. And Wario Ware-like boss rush modes, where you work your way through bosses from Punch-Out!! to Zelda 2 and Kirby's Adventure, are where NES Remix 2 really hits its groove. Also included are endless runners, levels that zoom out infinitely, platformers with multiple characters to control -- all of which are great ideas that return from the first NES Remix. This isn't a bad thing, but I was hoping to see NES Remix 2 ""break"" this batch of games in new ways.   Bonus Games The first NES Remix featured 204 challenges, but NES Remix 2 only has 159. Perhaps in an attempt to make up for this, Nintendo includes two bonus games with NES Remix 2: Super Luigi Bros. and Championship Mode. The latter is only unlocked if you have NES Remix (1) installed on your Wii U. Super Luigi Bros. is a right-to-left, mirrored-version of Super Mario Bros. (the entire game), with a the long-jumping, low-traction Luigi as its star. It's surprisingly mind-bending for Mario veterans and an awesome bonus. Championship Mode is a nod to the 1990 Nintendo World Championships cartridge, which was the original NES Remix -- a timed mix of Super Mario Bros., Rad Racer and Tetris used in Nintendo-held competitions. Championship Mode similarly chooses a mix of three games; Super Mario Bros., Super Mario Bros. 3 and Dr. Mario. It's not the best mix, but it's a cool historical nod. The lack of an online leaderboard is disappointing.   Nintendo promises several Miiverse social features in NES Remix 2, like the returning ability to post drawings and comments about challenges, and a new feature that allows you to watch videos of other players completing challenges, but these features weren't enabled for us to try them out pre-launch. Leaderboards to see how your friends stack up seem like an obvious inclusion; I would really like to see if fellow Remix fans Jose or Daemon can shave off a few milliseconds from a Punch-Out!! challenge, but there are no leaderboards or any way to view how your friends stack up. I concluded my NES Remix review with a plea for more Remix, saying that ""Punch-Out!!, Kid Icarus and Metroid were cruelly ignored."" Happily, NES Remix has returned and those three games are included in the lineup – but it turns out that better games don't necessarily make for better remixes. Nevertheless, it's great that Nintendo greenlighted the Remix crew to mess with more of its masterpieces in NES Remix 2. According to NES Remix director Koichi Hayashida, it looks like Super Nintendo Remix and Game Boy Advance Remix could actually happen, if there's enough demand for more: So here I am at the end of another NES Remix review, officially demanding more."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/15/pure-chess-ps4-review	 I love the game of chess more than nearly any video game ever released. It's strategic, timeless, and fun, and while chess owns a renowned status as a thinking man’s game, video game iterations have often had a hard time being as epic as the real thing. As someone who grew up fiendishly playing chess (and still does), I readily admit that no digital version will ever be as good as sitting at a table, weighted pieces placed and timer set. But some attempts are more successful than others. When it comes to Pure Chess, you’ll find something that hits the mark in some ways and misses it completely in others. Its single-player offerings challenge gamers with a variety of options that will please chess nuts, especially for its relatively low price. However, Pure Chess has completely unacceptable online functionality that doesn't allow people to play against each other in real time. Thus, in your pursuit of purchasing Pure Chess, you have to think about one thing and one thing only: do you want to play by yourself or online?  If you answered the former, you’re in luck, because Pure Chess totes a robust set of modes and options that prove their worth far beyond its entry fee. For starters, you can play against the computer in standard exhibition matches, sorting through various difficulty settings to find the artificial intelligence that best suits your skill level. The AI makes smart moves for the most part, though some questionable tactics are deployed from time to time, especially on the weaker settings, where the computer seems intent on defeating itself. Plenty of stat-keeping makes things interesting the more you play, and there are Trophies to earn, too. Tournament play versus the AI also proves to be a lot of fun. Three tournaments of four games each are presented at increasing difficulty levels, and only by winning all four games in a row do you progress through the tournament successfully. When combined with fleshed-out tutorials to teach chess newbies the fundamentals and awesome “Mate in 1-5” puzzles that chess nerds will adore, there’s plenty to keep players busy. You can even play with a friend locally, customizing board setup and timing to your heart’s content. Unfortunately, for all of the great single-player features Pure Chess offers, unacceptable online play brings the whole package down. Pure Chess has no online gameplay per se, unless you count its “play by mail” correspondence-style chess. Pure Chess forces you to play against others like prisoners play with each other in supermax facilities, by swapping annotated notes that are then loaded onto a board. Chess is a game made to be played in real time, not over days. Correspondence chess is fine (though not at all ideal), but it shouldn't be your only option on an internet-connected device in 2014. Interestingly, while this was the same issue I had with Pure Chess on PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita, its interface has been cleaned up, and there are more matchmaking options. You no longer have to jump through hoops to challenge people not on your friends list or use PSN's archaic messaging system to send notation back and forth. Still, playing chess in real time against a human opponent simply isn't an option, and that's unacceptable. You can't play a standard timed game against a friend or stranger across the country or across the world, nonetheless a quick game of Blitz or Bullet. All I can ask is, why not? I love chess and chess theory and you can easily find a lot of pleasure in playing and studying the game by yourself. But my greatest memories of playing chess happen to be with other people at cafes, clubs and in New York City’s Washington Square Park, not by myself in front of a computer or hunched over a book at my kitchen table. Developer VooFoo Studios seems to have lost sight of what makes chess special – playing with other people seamlessly – and this sad fact detracts from Pure Chess significantly.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	 Over 100 Kongs died to bring you this review. But it was not in vain, because beating Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze earned me some serious platformer bragging rights. This is a tough platformer, seemingly intentionally designed to make you go ape at times. Some stages quickly pulled the ground out from under me, others challenged me to make precise jumps using springboards, vines, and other kooky contraptions to move forward. But developer Retro has departed from the slavish series rebirth called Donkey Kong Country Returns and created something special here. Retro’s Wii revival had the unenviable task of reviving a classic series from the Super Nintendo era, so it constantly beat you over the head as if to constantly say, “Hey, remember this?” As a sequel, Tropical Freeze blazes its own trail by adding two character with useful abilities and unique ideas for challenging levels across six islands.  Tropical Freeze gives us 13 hours’ worth of lush jungles and exotic islands to explore, and DK and his friends have never looked better. Their furry pelts look great on the TV or the GamePad, and some of the character models have lots of tiny details -- right down to the age lines around Cranky Kong’s mouth and his perfect teeth. The different abilities of the smaller Kongs often helped keep me alive, and they also empowered me to discover some well-placed secrets. I often preferred Dixie Kong for her handy helicopter spin, since it helped me reach higher platforms and correct any mistimed jumps. One the other hand, Cranky’s cane bounce -- which safely allowed me to travel over spiky thorn pits and other enemies -- was a useful tool that also came in handy. I used Diddy Kong’s familiar jet pack less than the other two, but that shouldn’t dismiss his useful qualities: Thanks to Diddy’s hover ability, I could safely sail over small pits and keep going. In the end, the Kong you choose to tag along is an important decision, and I enjoyed having the power to choose because it allowed me to approach each stage in a different way. I found the world of Tropical Freeze equally impressive. Each level delivers a sense of scale that feels bigger than most two-dimensional games, and the visual variety adds to the sense of a much larger journey. I raced through a chaotic savannah as it was wrecked by a tornado that tossed enemies and platforms alike into the air, and a short time later a friend and I swam in search of safety as an enormous octopus tried to poke us with oversized tentacles. I bounced on giant hot-air balloons in the alps, and survived a chase by a deadly buzzsaw in one of those rollercoaster-like minecart stages. The constant switchups and level variety made sure I was rarely doing the same thing for very long.  The inspired level designs and stiff platforming challenges help Tropical Freeze hit rewarding high points that feel great after you’ve conquered a tough area. Take my advice: Jumping into Tropical Freeze with a boastful attitude that you've done it all in 2D platformers can lead to disastrous results. DK and the rest of this furry cast handle much differently than Mario and company. These characters genuinely feel heavier, and that emphasis on weight and momentum affects how you jump. I liked the distinct feel, and how it distinguished Tropical Freeze from a lot of platformers in the genre. Tropical Freeze’s six islands contain some tense challenges and lots of unique level ideas. Occasionally it’ll make you want to stop to take in these beautifully crafted stages, but sometimes it used these opportunities to show off wonderfully detailed animated transitions, like when DK pulls a stub out of the ground that sprouts into a giant tree. Other times the camera would swing and move to highlight just to point out how beautiful these settings could be. Secrets in Tropical Freeze are carefully hidden, often in plain sight. It's the kind of platformer where I felt like I’d pounded and prodded every surface in an attempt to uncover them all, yet some still elude me.  The difficulty slowly rises as you progress, and the challenge can feel impossible times, but I found myself getting better at Tropical Freeze the more I played. The average stage is long but fun, and each one always felt achievable. To help welcome novice players, there’s a helpful item shop in each stage where you can purchase potions, balloons, and shields that will keep you alive longer. These items help alot, but I made a conscious effort not to use them. I challenged myself to finish Tropical Freeze on my own terms. The lengthy boss fights and multitude of well-placed secrets and collectibles stand out as some of the best parts of Tropical Freeze. Boss encounters unfold over multiple phases, and in each one they adopt a new tell or move that requires careful attention. An Owl Boss in the third stage started with simple pattern of three eggs dropping from the sky, but by the third phase it turns into a Galaga-like pattern of multiple enemies that could crush an unaware Kong quickly. Partner Kongs play a helpful role in keeping me alive, and losing them in these encounters often left me in tight situations that demanded precise movement. But there’s a cool payoff when you defeat a boss. These satisfying encounters end with a button-mashing segment – an homage to the GameCube’s unique bongo-driven platformer, Donkey Kong Jungle Beat. It puts a hilarious exclamation mark on the end of a tough battle.  Couch multiplayer is a fun feature for a lot of Wii U games. Multiplayer mode is fun if you’re up to the challenge, but it demands careful and coordinated play, which is great if you have the right teammate. However, for a game built around unique character abilities, Tropical Freeze’s co-op multiplayer lacks an option for the second player to swap between Dixie, Diddy, and Cranky quickly without having to drop out completely and rejoin. Tropical Freeze also does nothing unique with the GamePad outside of Off-TV play, which is slightly disappointing. The screen goes blank if you’re using the TV as the primary viewer once you start a level. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze is a great platformer full of tense sequences and tough levels. Boss battles are a huge highlight, and it’s packed with hard-to-find secrets and collectibles. Multiplayer could use some improvement, but I found myself laughing whenever my teammate and I wiped out on some of these unforgiving setups. But a rewarding sense of accomplishment stuck with me each time I overcame a new obstacle, and that feeling kept me going all the way to the end.
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/04/unepic-review	 Unepic wants desperately to be an NES game. I realized this when as I sat cross-legged on the floor in front of my TV, a notepad with important locations and notes written on a crudely drawn map next to me. It took me back to when I made my way through games like The Legend of Zelda and Metroid so many years ago. With simple 2D sprites, unguided exploration, and steep difficulty, Unepic is an unabashed tribute to classic action-adventure and role-playing games. Much like the games that inspired it, Unepic even manages to be enjoyable despite some issues with AI and balance. No apologies are made for its difficulty. Inspired most notably by Castlevania, Unepic’s looming castle is a giant exercise in patience. With no outside guidance from the story or its NPCs, you must explore every inch of the castle to progress, with each section slowly unlocked as giant bosses are defeated. The in-game map is filled in as you enter each new room, and some important locations (like those of quest givers) aren’t labeled at all. Not only is every room of the castle filled with enemy goblins, orcs, skeletons, and other fantasy holdovers, they are shrouded in darkness as well. It is up to you to manually light torches fixed around every room just to see what’s trying to kill you. It may sound laborious, but I found charting the entire castle appealed to my more obsessive side.  Eventually opening up the entire castle is a fun process, but combat with the respawning hordes of monsters exposes Unepic’s major fallacy: its freedom of character creation. A hulking warrior in full plate mail proficient in axes; a mage wielding powerful ice and fire spells; a spry thief equipped with a twisted dagger and powerful sleep magic; the character you become is entirely up to your distribution of skill points. That sounds great in theory, but Unepic’s enemies are incredibly unbalanced, and it’s much easier to survive as a magic user than as a warrior. I played through most of it specializing in melee weapons and found that, if a group of enemies spotted me, I was almost always surrounded and killed. To survive, I had to exploit the enemy AI; I would get a single enemy's attention, climb down a ladder, then attack it as it tried to climb down after me, which would freeze it in place on the ladder. This trick only worked to a point, and at one of Unepic’s last few bosses – the giant flying head of Medusa’s brother – I simply could not progress. Not only does standing in the line of sight of the creature kill you instantly, it floats over a chasm, meaning melee attack is impossible. I was forced to respec my character (something you can only do once) and redistribute all points to become a master of fire and healing magic. Not only did I beat the boss with ease, I found that the range afforded by my powerful spells meant I no longer needed to use my ladder trick; I could burn most groups of enemies to ashes before they even approached. This was much more fun. While the unbalance is frustrating, I found reprieve in Unepic’s surprisingly charming writing. The main character, Daniel, is the victim of a botched possession by a spirit named Zeral in the early moments, and the two banter with each other throughout the story as they share the same body. The writing is overflowing with nerd references, including nods to the X-Men, StarCraft, Metal Gear Solid, Spaceballs, Star Wars, Futurama, Dragon Warrior, the Matrix; two shopkeepers are even named after Linux versions. There’s also some light genre-deconstruction. Zeral’s role as the unreliable NPC is often pointed out by Daniel, while some late-game narrative explains why enemies (and Daniel himself) constantly respawn, something I had accepted simply because I was playing a video game. The humor in general does a good job of softening the blow of dying over and over again, and the story had me interested in how it would all wrap up. Unepic’s Wii U version makes smart use of the GamePad. Spells, weapons, pets, and other abilities can be hotkeyed to one of over 20 buttons on the touchscreen, meaning it only takes a simple tap to quickly ingest a healing potion or switch from a sword to a bow and arrow. Active quest information and character status are displayed on the GamePad too, so all the pertinent information you need is available without having to open any menus. Off-TV play is supported, but it’s not the best way to play. Not only do you lose all the great touch-inventory features, but the already-small sprites are made that much harder to see on the GamePad’s smaller screen. There is an option to zoom in, but then you lose sight of the entire room, so enemy ambushes become much tougher to avoid. I also had a weird audio-distortion bug occur repeatedly after playing for about an hour on the GamePad. The only way to fix it was by closing out entirely. Unepic is an unabashed homage to classic 8-bit adventure and role-playing games. Its sharp wit and bevy of nerd-culture references offset the frustration that arises from an unrelentingly challenging dungeon crawler. Uneven character balance and some exploitable enemy AI limit the ways you can play enjoyably, but there are still rewards to be found in the careful exploration of the sprawling castle.
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/09/dr-luigi-review	 Whether through starring in his own games or stowing away as an Easter egg in others, the Year of Luigi has been just that, continuously thrusting the reluctant plumber into the spotlight. Its last hurrah is the surprise release of Dr. Luigi, a sort-of sequel to 2008’s Dr. Mario Online Rx. Aside from the classic pill-tossing gameplay, Luigi brings along new L-shaped pills that provide a fun twist on eliminating the tri-colored viruses. Despite the inventiveness of this new mode, the curious omission of a few key features from previous games in the series keeps Luigi's medical accomplishments from surpassing his brother's. Dr. Luigi doesn’t stray from the series’ classic rules: you've got to eliminate an endless stream of viruses by matching them with three like-colored pills. What is unique to Dr. Luigi is having three distinct choices in how to go about destroying viruses. In the most drastic change to the Dr. Mario formula to date, Operation L has Luigi (apparently unconcerned with medical malpractice lawsuits) toss double-sized pills down the throats of his patients. With each L-shaped pill containing at least three segments of the same color, there is always the chance to eliminate a virus immediately, so games typically move faster than in traditional play. However, misplacing a single pill fills up much more of the screen, meaning things can rapidly get out of hand if you aren’t careful.  I was concerned that this mode would be a shallow gimmick, but the new pills substantially alter the virus-busting experience. Finding space for the larger pills and making sure the leftover pieces from eliminated pills don’t fall in unwanted places is a fun, new challenge. To my surprise, I find myself drawn more to Operation L than the more traditional Retro Remedy mode. It’s a simple, effective change to the classic 23-year-old gameplay. The third mode, Virus Buster, is a more relaxed take on Dr. Mario. Instead of using the Wii Remote’s pointer controls like in Dr. Mario Online Rx, this version of Virus Buster plays much more like it does in Brain Age 2. Using the touchscreen and stylus, you must carefully guide pills down toward the viruses, rotating them to fit and match as needed. Pills drop one at a time initially, before ramping up to two and then three as time in each level passes. Even with three pills on screen at once, things move slowly, and the classic Dr. Mario music is pleasantly remixed and played at a slower tempo. The whole mode is a nice, tranquil break from the other more hectic options, and the tactile feel of using the GamePad’s touch screen makes it much better than its Wii counterpart. I found it easy to unknowingly whittle away an hour or two here. Retro Mission and Operation L can be played multiplayer both locally and online. The online play is particularly good; it’s easy to jump from match to match against friends or random strangers, and there are even worldwide and friends list leaderboards. I never had an issue finding an opponent in either mode, though on more than one occasion I was paired against someone ranked in the top 10 on the leaderboards. That never ended well for me. Setting up games against friends is a much more pleasant experience. Curiously, Dr. Luigi manages to omit a few noteworthy features from previous games. Three- and four-player matches are gone both locally and online, which feels like a step backwards. There is no Mii support whatsoever; you and your opponent always play as Luigi. Dr. Mario Online Rx also has the ability to play with a friend who didn’t own their own copy, but that ability is gone in Dr. Luigi. Considering this version costs $5 more than Dr. Mario Online Rx, those omissions are a tough pill to swallow. Dr. Luigi does a lot of things right. Operation L is a surprisingly drastic change to Dr. Mario’s established formula, and the improved Virus Buster mode serves as a welcome reprieve from the other modes’ more frantic action. Online play is seamless, if just a bit careless in matching up players of similar skill. But the lack of notable features of previous games, especially four-player matches, is puzzling and disappointing. Instead of the definitive Dr. Mario experience, Dr. Luigi is an interesting spin of an established classic.
Samuel Claiborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/20/nes-remix-review	" NES Remix is something greater than the sum of the 16 classic Nintendo games that provide its source material. With 204 carefully constructed challenges based on the likes of Super Mario Bros., The Legend of Zelda, Donkey Kong, Excitebike, and others, NES Remix is a frenzied, chaotic, and fun retro experience that's more enjoyable than simply replaying the straightforward ROMs of most these games on the Virtual Console. In NES Remix's Achievement-like challenges, Remix deconstructs old Nintendo games -- some you probably know by heart -- and asks you to dominate small moments in them: challenges like searching for a secret entrance in The Legend of Zelda on a timer, Defeating Bowser with only fireballs in Super Mario Bros., or hitting a hole-in-one in Golf. In their original context, these actions make sense, and might even seem mundane, but in its frantic WarioWare-like ""microgame"" presentation, NES Remix offers a clever way to revisit old games. There's something about adding strict constraints that can make moments in a familiar game (or a crummy game) more fun.  NES Remix presents its challenges in a way that encourages you to improve, with instant restarts, ample continues and on-screen guides. You can trust NES Remix to present a surmountable task, even if it doesn't seem that way at first. How can you possibly make it through a tough, flying-fish-filled level of Super Mario Bros. when you can't stop running? Learn the level, time your jumps, and when you hit that goal post, you'll feel like a superhuman speed-runner. Plus, each is outfitted with an Angry Birds-inspired three-star rating to push you to improve your score. The best of these challenges are ""remixes"" based on lovingly hacked versions of 1980s Nintendo games, which is why you'll see Luigi running through a mirrored version of Super Mario Bros. World 1-2. Classic games are modified in absurd ways: Slick ice and blizzard conditions are added to Super Mario Bros.; Link replaces Jumpman in Donkey Kong (hilariously, as he’s is unable to jump); and the screen zooms in as you play Balloon Fight, your pixelated balloon dude filling the screen and eclipsing obstacles. When Nintendo's various franchises are thrown together for no reason it can feel like exploitative fan service, but the developers of NES Remix (the same team behind Retro Game Challenge) studied the source games, broke them down, and aptly built them back up to present clever puzzles and gameplay that feel both new and familiar at once. The DJ spinning this Remix occasionally stops the party with a cringe-inducing needle-scratch. Even NES Remix's crack team of ROM hackers can't make Ice Climbers, Tennis or Clu Clu Land control sensibly. Or make Pinball fun. Though I trust NES Remix to present challenges I can eventually overcome, not all of them felt worth doing – but hey, if you’re a hardcore NES Pinball fan, you’ll have something to do after you complete the approximately 190 much more fun challenges.  In a startling oversight for a competitive game like this, NES Remix features no multiplayer – at all. Even in remixes of games that originally had it. And while passing the GamePad back and forth kept several IGN editors from doing any actual work this week, a competitive mode, or at least an online leader board would have been a natural fit for Remix. That said, the ability to share tips, drawings, and comments on each level, like the bulletins you might have seen in Super Mario 3D World, is included – and augmented by a selection of really great, unlockable stamps inspired by 8-bit sprites. I got a really helpful hint for getting that Golf hole-in-one from a crude drawing of the in-game meter. Thank you, artistic stranger! Nintendo knows the power of its back catalog, and that power isn’t always used for good. (See: Nintendoland, a milquetoast minigame collection inspired by some of the very same games featured in Retro Remix.) So it's especially cool to see Nintendo get behind a project like NES Remix, which both honors classic games and rips them apart. It’s a clever and challenging way to experience the classics without just retreading old ground. The possibilities for expanding the Remix series are so unbelievably great, too. I'm ready for the next batch now: Punch-Out!!, Kid Icarus and Metroid were cruelly ignored this time. And what about Super NES Remix? Game Boy Remix? Nintendo 64 Remix?!! But I digress."
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/06/adventure-time-explore-the-dungeon-because-i-dont-know-review	 If you’ve ever seen more than five minutes of the Adventure Time cartoon, you will know that it is gloriously silly, inventive, absurd, gleeful and generally rad. Explore the Dungeon Because I DON’T KNOW! is none of these things. It’s a stunning disappointment that a game based on Adventure Time should display this little imagination. Explore the Dungeon doesn’t set its sights too high, which is an encouraging sign for a licensed game that presumably had to be made in a short time with a limited budget. It doesn’t attempt to be anything more than a simple dungeon crawler, sending you down into a 100-level dungeon to smash up skeletons and monsters, collect loot and meet occasional bosses as a group of four (Finn, Jake, Marceline and Cinnamon Bun, initially). Aesthetically, it goes for 16-bit retro, depicting its characters as colourful sprites and opening with a chiptune rendition of the awesome theme tune. But the execution messes up even this simple set of ideas.  The most fundamental problem is that there is nothing interesting in the dungeon. Nothing whatsoever. There are no cool enemies, there are no hidden routes or secret passageways, there are no stranded characters or mini-stories or sub-quests to find, and most bafflingly there is no good loot. Basically all you ever find is money. You can pick up new weapons and badges that do things like slightly increase your max health, but there aren’t enough of them, and they don’t appear with nearly enough frequency –15 levels down, my friends and I were finding exactly the same items in chests as we were at the top, and though the selection does expand further down there’s never any mystery, and never any sense of excitement about what you might pick up. It completely fudges the basic Diablo-style compulsion loop that this genre relies upon. The enemies, meanwhile, are stunningly generic. With a cartoon universe as madcap as Adventure Time to draw upon you would hope that you’d encounter more than skeletons, blobs and bats, but most of the time that’s what you’ll be smashing. There’s also almost no skill at all to the simple combat beyond a timed block, which negates damage. That’s it. There are no special skills, and each character has just one special move. There was never much danger of dying – the reason I returned to the surface every five levels was not to regroup, but because I was so bored that I couldn’t stand one more identikit, lifeless floor. The scenery changes now and then as you get further down through the dungeon’s levels, but not significantly enough to maintain interest. At first it looks like it might be randomly generated from a selection of generic walls, pits, enemy spawners and sparse decoration, such is the uninspired arrangement of these levels, but no – they’re the same every time. Every 20 floors there’s a boss, but even these failed to imbue my play sessions with any excitement. “What was the point of that?”, said one of my exasperated play companions after we’d vanquished the second one. It says a lot for Explore the Dungeon that the addition of other people, which can elevate even the most boring games, does nothing for it. It fails to provide the basic elements of co-operation and competition to make it an interesting multiplayer experience. Some characters can float over pits and others can’t, which makes staying together difficult, and results in everyone wandering in disparate directions rather than working together as a team. It doesn’t matter much, as working together is pointless when characters don’t have complementary moves or skills. It’s an exercise in collective tedium – nobody I played this game with wanted to persist after the first ten minutes.  As if to hammer this home, when I first started playing on PS3 it froze up after the first ten levels and erased my progress twice – this was fixed by an update, but having to experience those dungeon floors three times gave me ample opportunity to admire how devoid of interest they truly were. Another deep-running problem is that Explore the Dungeon has no tangible sense of progression. Smashing up enemies doesn’t yield XP, so you’re not levelling up. Every time you dive into the dungeon you lose all the loot you gathered before, turning the game into an endurance test – you can’t save up, so the only way to accumulate a decent amount of loot to buy new stuff is to stay down in the dungeon for as long as you can stand it. I have played countless average dungeon crawlers that manage to get that basic fight-loot-improve compulsion loop going, but Explore the Dungeon sadly isn’t even average. The one thing it gets right is cute little 16-bit-style cutscenes , which retain a tiny bit of the Adventure Time spirit. But beyond the inclusion of the appropriate characters, you wouldn’t be able to tell this is an Adventure Time game. Nothing about it really relates to or ties into the show in a meaningful way. Adventure Time is just a skin for an almost impressively boring dungeon crawler. Some of the dialogue even seems to have been ripped directly from old episodes rather than specially recorded. It’s unfortunate for Explore the Dungeon that we are living through an amazing period for dungeon crawlers and roguelikes, but even if we weren’t, it would stand out as depressingly uninventive and simplistic. Unlike the show it’s based on, it’s both deeply boring and devoid of imagination. For a real sense of adventure, play Spelunky.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/20/wii-fit-u-review	 Wii Fit U is a great way to fit in your daily dose of exercise, but you might have to put up with a few verbal jabs first. In its judgmental eyes, for example, it said I’m obese based on my body mass index, and balance is “not my forte.” Thankfully, it doesn’t just leave you there to wallow in bad news. Wii Fit U has a huge variety of exercises to get your heart going, with only a few underdeveloped ideas tagging along as extra weight.  The first thing Wii Fit U has you do is take a “body test,” in which you enter your age, height, and other information, and then you are weighed and subjected to a balance test. All of this is simple, quick, and fun, but the Balance Board can be highly inaccurate at times. This wouldn’t be problem if you could choose to redo the tests or try them out with a practice run first, but neither is an option. Still, the Balance Board was able to collect accurate measurements most of the time. After your test, Wii Fit U recommends a proper BMI for you to reach. This ends up feeling limited because while your BMI is important, so is your body composition, which the Wii U has no way of measuring.  If you feel like that goal is too demanding, or inversely, not demanding enough, you can tweak the weight gain/loss goal and the amount of time in which you want to reach it. The talking balance board character on screen is helpful when setting your goals, and it will make a point to tell you if your workout regimen is too extreme. This is great because unrealistic fitness goals won’t help your motivation. Also, after your first test, Wii Fit U takes a picture of your face using the GamePad. Seeing your numbers improve is satisfying, but noticing improvement in before and after pictures is a tangible reward almost as satisfying as being able to tighten your belt a notch. Considering Wii Fit U’s cutesy interface, it might convince you that it can’t give you a good workout. The truth is that there are dozens of exercises for a huge range of fitness levels. Some are simple and might only elevate your pulse slightly. Stepping up onto the balance board in a Guitar Hero-like mini-game isn’t very difficult; neither are some of the beginner yoga stretches. But some, like planking or jackknifes, will have you reaching for a water bottle. Special mention goes to some of the sillier games that won’t burn many calories, but are good breaks between more rigorous sets. Holding the gamepad flat and delivering food to customers is a fun, simple exercise that tests your balance and speed, for example.  When you go to select exercises, it feels like a random adventure at first. After completing one, Wii Fit U will suggests two others to pick from – usually one for cardio and one for stretching or flexibility. It can feel a little unfocused and unhelpful, especially if you’re hoping to work up a good sweat. However, to counter this, it does have the option to schedule your own routines, which takes all the guesswork out of a daily workout. Scheduling them is simple, and you can make different lineups for different days that focus on yoga, strength training, flexibility, or other fitness goals. Once you figure out what you want to do and how long you want to do it, it’s as simple as getting on the board every day and following along. If you aren’t yet ready to create your own fitness plan, which is a reasonable position to be in, the virtual personal trainers offer a variety of fitness plans to select from. One, for example, is meant to boost your energy in the morning. One is a light, nighttime workout. The selection is almost too big, as some of them feel nearly identical. I would have preferred to see about half as many options, each with a distinctly different feel. When it’s time to weigh in with a new body test after some exercise, Wii Fit U can have some troubles. After a few days of work, the board read that I had lost over 200 pounds, which means I weighed about as much as a small dog. You can always do another body test, but it’s frustrating that you can’t just redo the readings mid-test instead.  Wii Fit U doesn’t require you to use its portable step counter, but doing so is a great way to help keep yourself accountable. The meter records steps taken, and when you’re back on the board you can transfer your data into the system and keep track of calories burned throughout the day. You can also see your steps visually represented in a few ways, like how far up a famous mountain you’ve managed to walk. This takes an activity as simple and forgettable as walking and turns it into something exciting, which is a great success. One of the best ways to reach your fitness goals is to work out with friends who will push you to keep going. Wii Fit U offers the ability to join a virtual gym with your friends, but it’s woefully incompetent. Competing with friends in mini-games could be fun, but you have to dig to find everyone else’s scores. There’s no easy way to see who has done what, who’s beating you at the hula-hoop game, or who’s even a part of your gym. Don’t let Wii Fit U’s cute, clean aesthetic fool you. When you turn it up a notch, Nintendo’s fitness game will have you breathing hard. Some of the options seem superfluous, and the gym functionality is totally ignorable, but it’s still a fun, effective way to get your sweat on.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	 After 28 years of making marvelous Mario platform games, you’d think Nintendo would run out of ideas. But Super Mario 3D World defies such logic and creatively sets itself apart – in good ways – from its outstanding recent predecessors, Super Mario 3D Land and Super Mario Galaxy 2. The characters and levels all showcase an unbridled sense of joy; the soundtrack crisscrosses between trendy jazz and orchestral arrangements of familiar Mario tunes; and even the surprisingly adorable cat suit managed to melt my stone-cold heart. But, most importantly, Super Mario 3D World nails something that the New Super Mario Bros games could not: it gracefully switches back and forth between a fun solo game and great competitive co-op play. Of course Mario games have seen their share of vibrant hues and stylized art direction, but Super Mario 3D World outdoes the simplistic visuals of New Super Mario Bros. U by substantial leaps and bounds. There’s a surprising amount of texture detail stitched into these worlds, along with subtle lighting and effects that accentuate each onscreen action beautifully. And then there are the little things: Mario and crew leave tiny puffs of smoke with each step and, after you’ve run for long enough, the trail explodes into a smoke trail. A random pattern of stars popped out each time I pounced on an enemy. These tiny whimsical details add up, and Super Mario 3D World’s overall visual design captures a youthful energy that flows into the expertly made levels themselves.  The amount of visual variety genuinely surprised me, but just as importantly, the level designs take interesting risks and aren’t restrained by obligatory grassy-field motifs or other well-traveled Mario stage themes. Much like Super Mario 3D Land, many stages present a unique and clever idea, play with it, and then bow away gracefully before it becomes boring. These levels are even better than in SM3DL, since they have much more entertaining flair and don’t constantly reward you with enough extra lives to render death meaningless. I explored a circus carnival full of tricky platforms, then carefully rode on oversized ants by bouncing on their heads as they crossed over deadly spikes. I rode on the back of a co-op controlled dinosaur named Plessie, and later sped through a charming stage paying homage to Super Mario Kart. I fought quirky new bosses and jumped across platforms on a speeding train. Much like the NES classic Super Mario Bros. 3, Super Mario 3D World doesn’t rest on its laurels or lean on any form of predictability. Obviously, Super Mario 3D World isn’t a sequel to the ingenious Super Mario Galaxy 2, but the overall design feels every bit as informed. Traveling through the clear pipes constantly reminded me of propelling through the galaxy between planetoids. The pacing also gave me flashbacks as I reveled in the sheer brilliance of how much energy and gameplay mileage Nintendo has packed into every world.  I should note that Super Mario 3D World shows a little restraint at first, and the initial four overworld areas don’t present much of a challenge for veteran Mario players. Eventually, later stages (and particularly some of the post-game worlds after the eight main ones) provide a maddening reminder that platformers can still offer a stiff challenge, even for us self-proclaimed experts. Expect to hear plenty of those signature falsetto caterwauls as you succumb to the later pitfalls of this adventure. Played alone it’s amazing, but multiplayer stands as one of Super Mario 3D World’s greatest accomplishments. Unlike the constant frustration of bumping into other players in New Super Mario Bros., here the other three characters (Luigi, Toad, and Peach) aren’t obstacles, but rather competitive buddies all vying for first place at the end of each level – and the privilege of wearing the crown in the next stage. I love how the crown, which is functionally meaningless – paints a bullseye on a leader’s back. In each co-op session I played, we’d all gang up on the leader to keep him from repeating his first-place showing. But a smart player realizes that the key to keeping the coveted crown lies not in wrestling over it with friends, but rather from getting in front of them with another excellent performance. Grabbing Green Stars and hidden Stamps becomes a key strategy in the race to dominate other players, so its best to keep ahead of the pack and make every move count. The unique character abilities helped each character of Super Mario 3D World stand apart and provided another layer of variety to the experience. Whether using Peach’s float jump or Toad’s extra speed, I found that levels were designed so that I could exploit these traits to find more stars and occasional hidden exits. And in co-op play these abilities set up interesting situations, like when Luigi could reach higher areas quicker than rest of the team. The only catch is that the camera becomes a slight obstacle in four-player multiplayer games. If you’re not travelling as a tight-knit group, someone is bound to get dragged along as a bubble in some sections. When dealing with two or even three players, though, it’s not as big a deal.  In a lot of ways, I’d say co-op with evenly-skilled Mario players is the best way to experience this 15-hour adventure. The flexible level design sets up a lot of laughs in co-op and even catastrophic wipeouts. The ensuing chaos of running through Mario levels cooperatively with my friends set up some of the most genuinely funny and memorable moments of any game I’ve played in years. If you can find one, two, or three friends who can Mario as well as you can, you won’t forget the experience anytime soon. Super Mario Galaxy 2 successfully iterated on one of the most inventive platformers of the last console generation. Super Mario 3D World takes slightly smaller steps in the grand scheme of the platformer genre, but it fulfills the promise of a multiplayer Mario much better than anything that the Japanese game maker has done before. Super Mario 3D World is marvelous, and its constant variety and fantastic light-hearted co-op play proves that Nintendo still knows exactly how to tweak the Mario formula in fun ways.
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/08/mario-sonic-at-the-sochi-2014-olympic-winter-games-review	 I still feel like I’m watching fan fiction scribbled in the back of my old elementary school notebook come to life every time I see Mario and Sonic running amok together, but the unlikely duo’s biannual Olympic series never really plays out the way I'd pictured it. This year's Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games makes excellent use of Wii U’s online capabilities and is overflowing with unlockable fan service, but yet again, it fails to ditch the incessant, imprecise motion controls that have been an unfortunate series staple.  Sochi 2014 features 18 different events; 10 are inspired by real-life Olympic events, like figure skating, hockey, and snowboarding, and eight fantastical “Dream Events,” which include snowball fights, Bullet Bill sledge racing, and a curling-inspired golf game. 18 events sounds like a lot, but I found that the majority of them play near-identically because of the simple motion control required in all but two of them. Whether skiing, snowboarding, riding in a bobsled, or ice skating, the goal in each is usually to reach the bottom of the course the fastest, and you get there by tilting the GamePad or Wii Remote Plus. It grew monotonous quickly. Besides being generic and repetitious, the motion control is also imprecise. I often wound up flying wildly off-course when trying to slightly adjust myself left or right. The Wii Remote was especially bad, as it often seemed to lose its “center” position, requiring me to pause to recalibrate it. Even with Motion Plus capabilities, the Wii Remote is simply unable to handle precise, small movements, which Sochi 2014 often necessitates. There are still a few standout games though. Hockey and curling are very good. Hockey plays like a light version of Mario Strikers on ice, and it thankfully uses regular analog sticks and buttons. Teams of four characters pass, shoot, body check, and use power shots to score as many goals as possible in two periods of play. There are a number of different rinks to play in, each with a different layout and environmental gimmick. I was pleased to find that Curling uses pretty much every function of the GamePad and Wii Remote. Before tossing a rock down toward the target, you use the GamePad to observe the lane and positions of the other rocks in play. You can draw a plan of attack using the touch screen, which the throwing player can then try and follow. Throwing the the rock involves a little flick of the Wii Remote and sweeping the ice is done by quickly shaking the Wii Remote. If you’ve never seen or played curling before, this probably sounds confusing, but taking the time to learn the rules and different strategies I actually found this to be one of the more complete games in Sochi 2014, and a great choice for a group of four players. The 18 events can each be played individually with up to four people or in predetermined and customizable circuits, akin to something like Mario Kart. There’s also the Action & Answer Tour, which injects trivia questions into the events, pleasingly mixing up the experience and making it less about pure mastery of the different games. Playing these three modes with friends is fun in short bursts, but I do wish there was a little more variety in things to do as a group.  The single-player campaign, called Legends Showdown, is pretty mundane. If you're looking for the crossover absurdity of Super Smash Bros. Brawl’s Subspace Emissary, you won’t find it here. Actually, you won’t find any story whatsoever. Instead, the cast of Mario and Sonic regulars faces off in each of the 18 events against shadow versions of themselves. In order to progress, you’ll have to simply play the same event over and over until you beat the A.I. opponent. And for some reason, the A.I. is completely hapless on the easy setting but nearly unstoppable on normal – I literally played curling for over an hour before finally besting it. So single-player mode is either a quick two-hour sample of each event or an excruciatingly exercise in futility. Though I have to wonder how much of that difficulty can be attributed to Sochi 2014’s unwavering and misguided dedication to motion control, as the A.I. seems to be playing in an alternate universe where developer SEGA Sports R&D made the right call and allowed people to play with sticks. The obsession with motion control is a shame, because Sochi 2014 is built to be highly competitive thanks to an impeccable online experience. Announcements pop up on screen letting you know when someone on your friends list has bested one of your record times in an event, encouraging you to go back and reclaim your crown. There are online leaderboards for each event, and the ghost data for the top global performer can be downloaded so you can see just how he shaved so much time from his run. It feels like Nintendo’s answer to SSX. Online multiplayer is an option for the first time in the series, and it actually functions quite well. I was able to smoothly play a number of games with two friends, one of whom lives in Europe. Sochi 2014 also ranks the performance of each country by combining the points you earn in multiplayer matches with other players from your country. So, apart from wanting to beat your opponents alone, there is an overarching goal to propel your country to the top of the global standings.  Disappointingly, only four of Sochi 2014’s 18 events are available in online competition, which excludes the standouts hockey and curling. Lobbies and voice communication are also missing, so while it’s possible to play with friends, it is quite cumbersome to setup. Plus, after a game, everyone is dumped back to the main multiplayer menu, necessitating another slow setup process before playing some more. A love for both Mario and Sonic emanates from all the unlockable goodies. A huge collection of music from classic games like Super Mario World and Sonic 3 can be unlocked and then played during any event. Clothing ranging from the Penguin Suit in New Super Mario Bros. Wii to full-on Sonic and Tails costumes can be worn by your Mii in-game (whom you can then use in local and online competition). As an old-school Sonic fan, I couldn’t stop smiling while skiing to the theme from Sonic & Knuckles’ Flying Battery Zone. Just as bad at skiing as platforming. But again, pretty much none of that matters when the controls are this bad. Each run I took on the same event fluctuated wildly as I would manage to stay on course during one attempt before suffering numerous penalties from missing checkpoints the next. I simply never felt comfortably in control of my character, and what's the point in competing in an event you can't control? A patch implementing analog stick control would make Sochi 2014 a much better, more competitive game. Mario & Sonic at the Sochi 2014 Olympic Winter Games has some of the best online capabilities on the Wii U, but it unwisely forces use of poor motion controls in almost every mode. For all its competitive elements, including leaderboards, online multiplayer, and downloadable ghost competitors, Sochi 2014 is just too unpredictable to make good use of any of them. There is some fun to be had in both local and online multiplayer, but half of that is the comedy of playing with terrible controls.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	 Batman’s always made the shadows his ally, but in Batman: Arkham Origins, he finds the shadow of his own previous games impossible to escape from. It’s as good as Batman: Arkham City in most ways, having inherited an outstanding combat system, but it lacks interesting ideas of its own, and it’s missing the polish and attention to detail that makes Arkham City and Arkham Asylum great action games.  Its name, “Arkham Origins,” is a flagrant misnomer - it may be a prequel, but this story is neither about Arkham, nor is it an origin story in any significant way. It’s more of a traditional Batman plot that retreads some of The Dark Knight’s most familiar themes over its roughly eight hours of main story content: a self-destructive insistence on working alone, and how far he’ll go to avoid taking a life - a concept the final battle cleverly toys with. It’s a respectable plot that even concocts a plausible reason for Batman to face so many villains all in one night – a $50 million bounty on his head. But it’s the kind of prequel that screams “What were we thinking when we killed off that incredibly popular character? Undo! Undo!” The actors standing in for long-time Batman and Joker voices Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill do a good job in emulating their predecessors - Troy Baker’s Joker, in particular, is close enough that I might not have noticed immediately if I weren’t listening for it. Conroy will always be Batman for me, but his understudy does well enough. This younger Batman already has all his signature moves and gear, flies a fancy plane, and is on a first-name basis with pretty much every villain but The Joker. So at the cost of really selling the idea that these events happen prior to the other two games, Origins keeps the foundation of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City’s amazing combat intact, including every gadget in one form or another. (Mr. Freeze’s absence from the rogue’s gallery means the cryo-grenades are now concussion or glue grenades.) Two new enemy types add a little extra variety, notably the martial artists who can counter your attacks. But the only substantial change is one of those things that’s awesome for the first time you use it, but quickly reveals itself as a bad idea. The Shock Gauntlets are among the last gear you unlock, which is good, because once charged (by hitting a few guys in regular combat) and activated, they let you completely ignore everything that makes combat interesting. Riot shields, stun batons, armored thugs – Batman just punches ‘em. They’re basically a win button, and the kind of thing that doesn’t work in a prequel because why would Batman ever get rid of them? Meanwhile, in the stealth fights where Batman picks off armed thugs one by one, there’s another somewhat dirty-feeling win button: a remote grapple that strings up thugs without them even having to walk under a gargoyle. I found myself deliberately avoiding either of those gadgets, because I’m not in this to not fight criminals.  Even so, I could live in the challenge rooms for days, trying to string together the ultimate, uninterrupted flow that includes each of the dozen or so moves and gadgets in Batman’s arsenal. With the gamepad in the right hands (which every so often, mine are) it looks like elaborate fight choreography. And Predator still makes me feel like a ninja, particularly when playing in challenge mode where I can disable certain gadgets or enable other handicaps. Out in the expanded and snow-covered open world, I found Gotham City beautiful but lifeless. In Arkham City, the excuse is that this part of town has been walled off and given to the criminals. Without that (admittedly far-fetched) scenario, the absence of any hint of civilian life makes Gotham feel eerily barren, especially next to Origins’ open-world peers and their populated streets. It may be the middle of the night on Christmas Eve, but streets teeming with nothing but decidedly un-jolly criminals are still weird. The northern half of the map, which is largely recycled from Arkham City, is connected to a new southern island by a tediously long bridge that your quest marker will frequently make you cross as you chase the next mission waypoint. The bridge stands out as crumby and inconvenient map design and I rushed to skip it with fast travel at every opportunity. Gotham is also full of annoying blockages that seem like Batman should be able to easily grapple or climb over, yet prove frustratingly insurmountable. Also, the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and Wii U versions all suffer from framerate problems while gliding around the city. Those slowdowns are most pronounced on the Wii U, where I also ran into mid-game loading pauses. On PS3, I encountered audio glitches that got worse the longer I played – most noticeable during fast-travel animations.  What constantly nagged at me, though, is that I spent the first few hours searching every corner of Arkham Origins for the DC Comics-themed Easter eggs that Rocksteady (the developer of the previous games) liberally stashed around the environments of Arkham Asylum and Arkham City. But the most I ever saw outside of the Batcave was a Flying Graysons poster. That’s not to say there’s no incentive to explore – Gotham is, as ever, littered with collectable items, some of which are locked behind puzzles you have to gadget your way through – but they’re nowhere near as much fun as finding a hint that Scarecrow was here. Some of the love is missing here. Technically, there’s plenty of things to do around town, as it’s terrorized by a lineup of villains like The Penguin, Mad Hatter, and Anarky. Yet most of their missions boil down to the same “Go here, beat up a group of thugs, and deactivate/blow up a thing,” with variety limited to some of them having a timer on them. The one set that feels interesting are the radio towers, which must be disabled in order to unlock fast-travel locations. Those are mini-fortresses that integrate some tougher fights with light puzzle solving. For visual novelty, the new crime-scene investigations are impressive, and take the “zoom and enhance!” cliche to new extremes. Using the shoulder buttons to scrub through an augmented-reality reconstruction of events looks great, but it’s only barely interactive; all you do is find the next clue (hint: it’s the thing that’s highlighted for you) when prompted and scan it to get the next piece of the puzzle – no decision-making involved. It’s a better, showier use of Detective Mode than Asylum or City came up with, but still, it’s just for show. When using the Wii U Gamepad, you're encouraged (but not forced) to use the LCD as a viewfinder and control the first-person perspective camera with the motion controls instead of the sticks, which is unwieldy and gimmicky. The Wii U Gamepad is mostly useful as an always-on map, but outside of that Arkham Origins is strangely inconsistent about when it's used. The most notable omission being the Cryptographic Desequencer hacking tool. This is a gadget that looks and behaves much like the Gamepad itself, yet the Gamepad isn't used at all.  Where Origins does its best work are in its boss fights. With only one exception, they’re all very physical, direct encounters with supervillains. A few stray dangerously close to quick-time event territory, since Arkham games’ combat is prompt-heavy to begin with, but the spectacle of the unique animations makes them feel like a Batman fight should - most notably the Deathstroke duel. Others are simply mob brawls or stealth fights with a particularly dangerous foe mixed in, but the added challenge of having to stay on the move while fighting to avoid bombs, for example, brings something different to it. This is the first Batman game to have multiplayer (on all platforms except Wii U), and the eight-player mode feels like a first draft. Most of the time you’re playing a mediocre third-person shooter in which your three-man team competes for territory control points with a rival gang. The twist is that two other randomly selected players are Batman and Robin (who doesn’t appear in the campaign) picking people on both sides off using Predator mode moves and an extremely clumsy version of the single-player combat. Granted, it’s a fairly clever idea – I do like how when I’m fighting other thugs I have to be fearful of a hero sneaking up behind me, and when I’m looking up at the gargoyle perches trying to shoot down a hero a thug is likely to shoot me in the back. Plus, two heroes working together can dominate using classic Batman-uses-a-minor-as-a-diversion tactics. But given the unremarkable shooting mechanics, the multiplayer mode is a novelty that I wouldn’t expect to get more than a few sessions out of. Wii U owners aren't missing much here. Batman games are like pizza: even when they’re not very good, they’re still pretty good. Next to Arkham City, Arkham Origins is a bit of a disappointment in its lack of new ideas and use of win buttons, making it the least interesting of the trilogy. But as excuses to dive back into the excellent free-flowing combat and predator takedowns go, this story isn’t bad.
Richard Cobbett	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/23/how-to-survive-review	" At this point, the zombie apocalypse doesn't sound too bad - with or without How To Survive's gory edutainment mix of Zombieland and The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy. We're all well versed in how to deal with the risen dead, and have even picked up a few tips on being the best undead monstrosity we can be after the inevitable happens. A survival economy would mean never having to wait in line at the bank again. It could even be fun, working off the frustrations of a bad day by grabbing a baseball bat and bursting some skulls like bubble-wrap. It might be short-lived fun, but it'd be fun nonetheless - unlike How to Survive, which is also short, but spends far too much time squandering rather than embracing its good ideas.  Imagine Dead Island as a twin-stick shooter, and you're most of the way to what How To Survive is - the main addition being Sims-style Need bars, which are so easily kept in check that they fade into irrelevance almost immediately. You need food, sleep and water to fight, but the maps are tiny and well enough stocked that you’re never more than a quick jog away from handling any of them. This can be even further mitigated with perks after a couple of level-ups, quickly making the whole non-zombie related survival element half implemented at best, and half thought out at worst. Early on, for instance, it's shown that using a healing plant - and the fact that there are healing plants is a pretty good demonstration of how gamey this is - provides a minor health boost, while combining it with fabric will produce a more effective poultice. Makes sense. There's no reason to ever not make the poultice though, since cloth is everywhere, crafting is done in the inventory, and time freezes when doing it, even mid-battle. It’s just busy-work, even sillier than the way that supposed safehouses actually attract enemies when you open the door and come filled with enough undead to double as zombie clown cars. Weapons are more entertaining to craft, even if most blueprints you find aren’t that exciting. More unfortunately, as much as H2S wants you to craft its wilder, wackier gear, it soon succumbs to the common crafting game problem of offering no good reason to trade in a rifle that kills damn near everything in one shot for a bladed boomerang or whatever. Ammo could have offered one, but it’s functionally unlimited. Bullets are everywhere, and arrows easily crafted/retrieved. Combat itself at least is solid; not great, but acceptable. To How To Survive's credit, popping zombies does have that all-important bubble-wrap satisfaction, and targeting is easy and precise enough - though zombie pile-ons are as little fun as ever, and it's a little depressing for humanity as a whole just how much more dangerous than us undead ostriches and deer turn out to be. Easily the most pathetic are the nocturnal zombies, who are meant to make travel by night dangerous. Ha. No. Shine a torch on them - the batteries never run out - and they freeze or run, incapable of defending themselves from the mute with the machete. Zombie fiction loves to tell us that we're the real monsters, but damn. This makes I Am Legend look like a bar fight. En mass of course, the zombies are more effective. Enemies can come from anywhere, including sealed rooms and more than once out of thin air, and do serious damage. They don’t evolve much, but that’s in How To Survive’s favour - like Dead Rising, there's a solid capability curve as you go from handling a few at once to taking on entire hordes without even breaking a sweat. Most of the time, the checkpointing is on your side too, albeit unpredictably. At one point, How To Survive saved with a boss at 20% health - helpfully, but still confusingly - while other times saw level transitions go completely ignored, adding an extra load screen per demise. All of this however is wrapped around one of the most half-assed story modes in years, as well as some dedicated challenge maps. Both modes support bringing along a buddy for co-op play (local and online for Challenges, local only for the story), with three sets of stats masquerading as characters to choose from. The main event though is little more than a long seven or so hour long trudge to repair a sea plane. There are no surprises, not many characters, and most of the writing is poor and sloppily edited. At times, it feels like it’s boring itself to the point of needing to add things like talking monkeys to break up the tedium. At others, it outright embraces it, with padding like a 20 item scavenger hunt when the game should be politely ending. The weirder bits are still welcome though, and not just because How To Survive otherwise plays things so much by the numbers that you could put paint to them and end up with a pretty picture of the Grand Canyon. Sometimes, they even land a genuine hit - most notably with crazy survivalist Kovacs, author of the titular How To Survive guide. He’s easily the best thing in the game, bringing a sense of life and enthusiasm to the action that’s otherwise entirely lacking. He's sadly off-screen most of the time rather than the lead though, with the actual main characters so lifeless and apathetic that at one point they see a child fall… oh, a whole meter or so into the perfectly safe sea, and can't even be bothered to check if she's still alive. (""You’re a real sh*t of a human being,"" your character is later told, and you can’t really argue that it’s not deserved.) Whether this kind of moment sounds funny or insufferable though, there aren't many like it to enjoy/endure, with the comedy almost immediately joining the survival mechanics, the crafting and the horror in the bin of frustratingly wasted potential that are all the more annoying for actually being interesting ideas. It's not hard to see the game that How To Survive wants to be, or the much more hardcore survivalist zombie sim it could perhaps have become. This isn't either of those games though, more's the pity. They could have been neat. How To Survive's big problem isn't what's there, it's what isn't - that it’s less half a game as half of several different ones, duct-taped together in its own crafting system to create something functional, but hardly desirable. It's an adequate twin-stick shooter, and a few years ago that might have been enough. With so many zombie games out there now though, one this uncommitted to its own ideas can never hope to be more than just part of the horde."
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/23/wii-party-u-review	 I must admit to a level of skepticism when I began playing Wii Party U. Seeing as how it comes packaged with a Wii Remote Plus, I came in believing it would be on the level of a shallow minigame collection like Wii Play. To my surprise, Wii Party U has plenty to do, including a number of minigames and challenges that mostly use the GamePad and Wii Remotes in smart ways. Of course, like any good party, a group of friends is still a requirement for a good time.  Wii Party U is divided up in to four modes: TV Party, House Party, GamePad Party, and Minigames. TV Party plays a lot like the Mario Party series; you roll dice to move around a game board while battling in minigames. While two of the five boards follow a straightforward “get to the finish line first” objective, the other three inventively mix things up quite a bit. One of my TV Party favorites is Mii Fashion Plaza, where you must collect items of clothing as your Mii moves around the board. As you pass the starting location, Judges award points based on the number of items worn and whether or not they are in the same style (astronaut, rock star, Mario, etc.). Winning minigames and landing on special spaces on the game board allows players to steal clothing from each other, either to complete an outfit or to prevent a foe from getting the most points possible. TV Party’s variants provide substantial changes to the experience, not simply a different backdrop, and that keeps the novelty going longer. The Minigames mode takes the board game out of the equation altogether, and it actually has a good variety of ways to play in its tournaments, a single-player dojo with increasingly difficult AI, and a cooperative mode. Wii Party U manages to provide some flair for what could have been a fairly basic feature.  The minigames themselves fit comfortably between Mario Party 8’s excessive waggle obsession and Mario Party 9’s near abandonment of shaking the Wii Remote. In most cases, buttons are used where appropriate over waggling. When shaking is required, it is usually done in a clever way. One standout game involves winding two propellers in order to fly; instead of mindlessly waggling for 10 seconds, you must alternate between the left and right propellers in order to wind them nearly equally, otherwise the craft will simply veer off sideways. Call it waggling with care. While mostly skill-based, there are a few minigames that rely entirely on luck. In these games, you make a choice and cross your fingers. It isn’t so bad with friends, as the odds at least feel somewhat even, but it’s hard not to get angry at the AI players when they fluctuate between picking the wrong choice every time and escaping without a scratch on a game-to-game basis. House Party is a more casual and friendly affair that puts much less emphasis on competition. Three of the eight games are particularly fun, with the rest either being just okay or a waste of time. My friends and I especially enjoyed Name That Face, in which the GamePad displays an event (standing on the sun, about to sneeze) and has one player take a selfie making an appropriate face. The rest of the group then views the picture and must pick the right event out of four choices. It’s simple, with a bit of Wario-esque charm. Still, House Party is mostly dominated by middling experiences. Dance With Me has everyone stand in a circle and hold Wii Remotes together, raising and lowering their hands in rhythm with songs from games like Tetris and Mario. That sounds alright on paper, but it isn’t really all that responsive or fun in practice. Feed Mii!, meanwhile, is especially bad, asking three people to shout out food items from a menu on the TV while the player with the GamePad inputs each order. It really isn’t worth playing more than once, and even that might be a stretch.  The final mode, GamePad Party, is designed for two players sitting with the GamePad between them. Some simple puzzle and sports games are available here, including my absolute favorite game in Wii Party U: Tabletop Baseball. In it, you and a friend take turns pitching and batting by pulling one of the GamePad’s sticks back and releasing it. It sounds simple, but there is some nuance with pitching, where the speed of the ball is directly affected by how far back the stick is pulled. My wife and I got into some heated matches, hurling fastballs and tossing change-ups as we tried to keep the other off balance as they’re swinging the bat. While the rest of GamePad Party is okay, I think Tabletop Baseball might become a nightly staple in my house for the foreseeable future. I should stress that for as much as I enjoyed Wii Party U, most of it simply must be played with a group of four or more. TV Party with me, my wife, and two AI opponents really wasn’t anything spectacular, but it became so much better the next night when friends (and a few adult beverages) entered the fold. Small groups – and single players especially – will feel lonely at this party. Wii Party U is a surprisingly deep experience with a variety of ways to play. While there are some duds to be found in each mode, there are enough highlights to have fun in plenty of different ways. With the included Wii Remote Plus as a bonus, Wii Party U is a steal for anyone who plays games with friends and family often, but the AI makes for poor company.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/21/deus-ex-human-revolution-directors-cut-wii-u-review	 There’s no shortage of video games that let you kill things. There’s also no shortage of video games that promise to make the activity exciting, varied, or even optional. Deus Ex: Human Revolution - Director’s Cut takes that same pledge and not only follows it, but shapes its combat and environmental design to ensure the philosophy can’t be forgotten.  Human Revolution first released in 2011. Two years later we’ve received the Director’s Cut, which includes the excellent DLC, useful new Wii U GamePad features, and reworked boss fights that promote experimentation. Everything else, including the pronounced black-and-gold aesthetics, is just as good as you remember it. In the not-too-distant future, the wealthy and privileged can augment their bodies with cybernetics. Enhanced eyeballs, legs, and arms are only an operation away. Human Revolution explores what happens when such scientific improvements drive a wedge between the rich and poor, further dividing the two social classes. This isn’t just backstory, though. When walking through futuristic Detroit, for example, the disparity between the two groups is noticeable at every turn. A dire but effective anxiety permeates everything. Protagonist Adam Jensen’s employer is one of the largest biotechnology manufacturers in the world. After an attack on Sarif leaves Jensen mangled and his love interest missing, a large percentage of his body is replaced with mechanical augmentations. He even receives face-mounted sunglasses that retract quickly and look kind of cool. The story that follows raises questions about loyalty and the evolution of humanity, but mostly it’s about Jensen finding his girlfriend — which is a tad disappointing when much more tantalizing mysteries loom in the background. The Deus Ex series has a reputation for letting you play in whichever style you choose, and Human Revolution wisely follows this blueprint. I played a combat-happy version of Jensen, so I improved his defense, weapon stability, inventory capacity, and melee takedowns. Later I added a Typhoon upgrade that launches out explosives from Jensen’s body (from parts unknown) in a 360-degree radius. Those who favor caution and stealth could improve their hacking prowess, reduce the noise of their footsteps, or even opt to turn completely invisible. Mixing and matching works too, because Human Revolution never forces you down one path.  Environments are built with a wealth of gameplay options in mind. Whether in wide open city streets or cramped corporate corridors, there are plenty of side routes and secrets to discover. Ventilation ducts let you evade enemy patrols and get to your destination faster. Computers and terminals can be hacked to open weapon caches or turn robots against their owners. The world makes sure no play style is given a clear advantage, which makes upgrading your character exciting instead of stressful. You really can’t mess up. In the first release of Human Revolution, boss battles heavily favored those who beefed up their characters for combat. The Director’s Cut evens the playing field for everyone. You can still blast enemies to death, but now most of the time you can now hide, hack, or do whatever else it is that your character excels at. They’re markedly less frustrating this time around, and they feel like a proper part of the Human Revolution experience rather than odd outliers. The Missing Link DLC is included in the Director’s Cut, but if you weren’t aware it was sold separately, you’d never know that those three or four hours of content weren’t originally meant to be there. In The Missing Link, Jensen is abducted, captured, and stripped of his gear and abilities. If you’re getting tired of stabbing bad guys over and over, this is the chance to see what other kinds of gameplay Deus Ex has to offer – all without sacrificing what you’ve already worked for up to that point.  Part of what makes Director’s Cut for the Wii U the best version of Human Revolution is the GamePad’s functionality. Instead of taking up a good chunk of your main screen, the map is now found on the controller. It’s easier to see enemy’s icons on the closer screen, and you can mark up the map with your own notes. A quick menu lets you access weapons and gadgets easily, and hacking feels faster and more intuitive when you can simply tap nodes with your fingers. The most interesting addition is the ability to take a screenshot of your surroundings at any time, and write advice over the image and share with your friends on the Miiverse. There’s also a built-in strategy guide and plenty of interesting developer commentary available for those who want a behind-the-scenes look into Human Revolution’s development. The well-tuned gameplay of Human Revolution can sometimes falter when it attempts (or doesn’t attempt) to explain its game-isms. Given how quickly enemies will punish your stealth slip-ups, it’s odd that some of them will ignore Jensen’s more blatantly ridiculous activities. Police are reasonably suspicious when you gain temporary access to their department, but they do nothing when they clearly see you entering their air ducts or carrying vending machines. When I approach some characters with a weapon drawn they plead for me to holster it, nearly in tears. Literally two seconds later, they’re striking up a perfectly normal conversation like nothing happened. We often forgive these odd behaviors “because it’s a game,” but when some oddities are justified in-game and others are not, the reality of the world feels fractured and incomplete. Deus Ex Human Revolution - Director’s Cut had an unenviable task: take one of 2011’s best games and make it even better, all while figuring out how to best utilize the oft-ignored GamePad. It succeeded on all fronts. The included DLC, the slick GamePad features, and the reworked boss fights make this the definitive version of Jensen’s story. Though, if you’ve already seen what the original game has to offer, there aren’t enough substantial differences to warrant a second purchase. Note: Notice that this version has a lower score than the original Deus Ex: Human Revolution review? Here's why.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/18/sonic-lost-world-review	 Much like a good sports car receives praise for the predictability of its grip and braking performance, the best 3D platformers are similarly praised for the predictability of their jumping and movement, which create a sense of rhythm and control. While 2011’s Sonic Generations understood this perfectly well, Sonic Lost World does not, making the Blue Blur’s latest outing a clumsy, ungainly 3D platformer that doesn’t do Sega’s mascot the justice he deserves. To its credit, Lost World does look the part. The framerate is hard-locked at 60, and the visual motifs of each act hit all the notes you’d hope for. World one honors Sonic tradition with the trademark “Green Hill” look, and from there it expands to a gamut of familiar themes, from pinball casinos to beachside paradises. Colors are well-saturated but occasionally flat-looking, lacking the depth and vibrancy I expect out of such a varied palette. Though it subdues Lost World’s look ever-so-slightly, it certainly doesn’t keep it from being pleasant to look at.  If only it was equally pleasant to play. Lost World is a strange sort of design feat where no one thing is broken, but everywhere you look there’s a subtle, but significant tuning decision that conspires to throw a monkeywrench in the works. Like any other long-time Sonic fan, I’ve grown accustomed to how controlling him feels, and Lost World countermands that comfort in some terribly jarring ways. For one, Sonic doesn’t really accelerate the way he has in the past. Moving the left stick puts him right into a leisurely jog that’s more Italian plumber than blue hedgehog, and even while dashing with the right trigger depressed, his speed felt lacking. What’s more, jumping takes a noticeable chunk out of your forward momentum, resulting in leaps that fall far shorter than you’d expect. Sonic doesn’t accelerate through his jumps anymore either, which means you’ll need to use the double-jump (returning from Sonic Colors) to cross all but the narrowest of gaps. Wall running has become a much bigger part of Sonic’s repertoire as well, which I’d be all for if not for the fact that he has a tendency to wall run on any vertical surface he’s airborne near, whether I want him to or not. A new secondary lock-on attack has you homing in on foes and punting them forward to clear out their buddies too, but every time you do so, everything jerks to a halt. Its intent is to highlight the impact, but all it really does is interrupt the flow of movement. At nearly every opportunity, Lost World kept me from the speed and precision I craved. I’ve played a lot of Sonic over the years, and the controls have never felt as alien and inconsistent as they do here. Not as fast as it looks. There are brief, scripted moments that convey Sonic’s traditional speed, but these mostly amount to mini-cutscenes that take control out of your hands. A handful of levels managed to get out of my way long enough to build up a legitimate head of steam, but for the most part, I was stuck watching Sonic go fast rather than making him go fast. Compounding these problems are the level designs which feel decidedly Super Mario Galaxy-inspired. I’ll happily give them credit for opening up some welcome exploration possibilities, but placing much of the 3D landscape on cylinders and spheres also necessitates a bunch of lateral movement – a concept that aggressively contradicts my natural hedgehog instinct to sprint towards the horizon. How do I speed through that again? In fact, Lost World tries its darndest to make you play it like a Mario game, but it lacks the thoughtful layouts and raw creativity required to pull it off. The throwaway puzzle elements add nothing to the experience, and the methodical, over-long jumping sequences are more tests of patience rather than skill. The same could be said for the gamepad-based mini-games, which come off as desperate attempts to shoehorn a second-screen experience into a game that really doesn’t need one. You would think that the 2D sections would break free of this design gridlock, but they don’t. The same control issues carry over, and are exacerbated by level designs that lack the rhythm and cohesion that were the franchise’s hallmark in the 16-bit era. There was an opportunity here to breathe some life into the experience with some classic Sonic precision, but alas, Sonic is forced  to stumble along. It looks familiar, but it doesn't feel familiar. On top of all of this, Lost World’s roughly eight-hour story is sprinkled with additional little bits of mediocrity. I died more than one cheap death thanks to odd spin-dash and lock-on attack glitches. The main villains serve up some of the most boring battles in the series’ history, while spouting winners like “I’ve been dreaming of pounding your sorry blue butt!” I only wish I were making that up. And I’m here to tell you, whoever signed off on Lost World’s ice act, called Frozen Factory, must hate fun. That’s the only explaination for a five-minute-long level where Sonic encases himself in a giant snowball to slowly and uncontrollably slip and slide across narrow ledges flanked by bottomless pits. After the success of Sonic 4, Colors, and Generations, this is a big disappointment for Sega’s speeding blue bullet. Sonic Lost World clumsily tears all the wrong pages out of the Super Mario Galaxy playbook, and in so doing, loses the breathless speed and fluidity that makes a Sonic game a Sonic game. Graphically it may talk the talk, but the controls and level design just can’t walk the walk, much less run it.
Steve Butts	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/13/skylanders-swap-force-review	 Skylanders Swap Force delivers almost everything fans could want. There are fantastic new characters, a funny story, and a complete disregard for the boring rules that say robots and wizards shouldn't be part of the same world. It also delivers everything Activision, its publisher, could want. There are loads of new toys that you need to complete the optional challenges, a brand-new portal that you can only purchase in the starter packs, and a fanbase that has already made the previous games runaway bestsellers. The initial appeal of Skylanders has always been in putting that physical toy on the portal and then watching it come to life in the digital world. While I'm still fascinated by the hardware and software that makes that transition possible, Skylanders' real magic is its unrestricted embrace of everything in the toy box. When my kids sit down to play, they don't only play cowboys or ninjas or robots or dinosaurs; they play in a world where all of those things exist side by side. Skylanders has always promoted that concept by including characters that might not really make sense together. What makes the rollerskating zombies, enchanted trees, and robotic dragons compatible is the series' humor and visual style.  That anything-goes approach is even stronger in Swap Force thanks to the new swapping mechanic. Now you can take the rattlesnake cowboy and swap his tail for a giant robotic wheel, or take the bomb-lobbing fire knight and place his top on the octopus pirate's tentacles. However, there are only six of these swappable Skylanders available at launch, only two of which come with the starter pack. The plan is to release 10 more swappable characters for Swap Force, which means there will be hundreds of potential combinations of figures if you’re willing to buy them all. The payoff for these absurd combinations is really mostly visual at the start, but as I began to unlock new abilities for the swap characters' various parts, I started to see there's a compelling strategic decision here as well. The characters from the previous games have always given us lots of options to choose from in terms of play style – you could be a brawler with loads of armor, or a speedy character who can dish out damage at range – but Swap Force lets you create your own play styles. Maybe you want to use the teleporting legs of Hoot Loop, the magical owl, but you also really like to use Magna Charge's helmet to lift enemies up into the air and slam them down on the ground. By swapping the two halves of each character, you get something entirely new and unique. Without giving too much away, I've been really curious to see how this sequel's story played out. The epilogue of last year's Skylanders Giants hinted at a new villain for the series, and I'm happy to say it pays off here. Kaos is still one of the funniest and most enjoyable villains in gaming today, but the series has needed another antagonist who can support an entire game. Having Kaos and this other villain play off each other in Swap Force is well worth the wait. Combat will be familiar to fans of hack-and-slash games like Diablo and Torchlight, but Skylanders leans a bit more towards kid-friendly button mashing and skill upgrades than the execution of combos. There's a satisfying range of enemies here, from weak and tiny Chompies who overwhelm with numbers, to more powerful enemies armed with special attacks or armor. There are even Spellpunks who can strike from a distance and even heal other enemies on the screen. As a result, the action changes enough from encounter to encounter to keep things from ever getting stale. Some of the boss fights can get a little predictable, but that's understandable given the younger target audience.  Outside of the fighting, there's a lot to explore and discover in the levels and the between-mission hub. Some, like the legendary treasures and hats, can be used to boost the abilities of your entire team or of individual Skylanders. There are also plenty of bonus missions and levels to be discovered in far off corners of the campaign's missions. Unfortunately, the new unlocking minigame is needlessly convoluted and not nearly as intuitive or enjoyable as the simple ball-in-a-maze puzzle in the previous games. Even more disappointing, there's no Skystones mini-game here. That card game is easily one of the most pleasant diversions in the previous game, so it's sad to see it gone. Swap Force includes the usual elemental gates from previous games (which can only be opened by a Skylander associated with that same element) but it also includes new multi-element gates that require either a swapped Skylander of both elements, or two players who each represent one of the elements. It's a great way to encourage swapping and cooperative play. The new swappable Skylanders also each come with unique movement powers that are tied to specific challenge gates. These challenges deliver more platform-like experience – like climbing up a vertical wall while dodging falling rocks, or bouncing along floating islands – that are a nice break from the core game and help reinforce some of the unique character of the associated Swap Force Skylander. Additionally, Swap Force goes a bit farther than Giants in providing meaningful milestones along the way. Each time you earn a star in a level, find a treasure chest, or add a certain type of Skylander to your collection, you earn progression points that open up new Portal Master ranks. The ranks themselves only really seem to be useful for opening up upgrade slots, which is a bit of a shame, but it's still nice that Swap Force provides such a clear way to track your progress. The most insidious part, of course, are the paths that track how many Skylanders you own. Seeing that you can earn additional Portal Master ranks by owning multiple Skylanders from a certain series, or a certain elemental type, might seem like a great way to reward hardcore fans of the series, but for people who aren't comfortable buying dozens of figures, it might seem like blatant marketing. You'll have to set your own standard for the cost of the toys, but the new movement abilities of the swappable Skylanders are required to unlock many of the available optional challenges. As I said, the starter set comes with two swappable characters but you're looking at paying as much as you'd pay for a whole other game if you want to buy the other four available figures at launch. There are two movement powers that aren't even available in this first wave of figures, so you'd be looking at adding even more to your collection down the road if you want to get at everything Swap Force has to offer. Skylanders Swap Force adds lots of things that are sure to please fans. The swappable Skylanders and new challenges are smart, and the story is as funny and charming as ever. I particularly like the way the writers build on the epilogue of the previous game. More than anything else, Skylanders is just fun – but to get the most out of it, you'll end up paying the price of the game a couple times over.
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/11/just-dance-2014-wii-u-review	 If what you want from a dance game is instruction on how to become a better dancer, Just Dance is not the one for you. For that you probably want Dance Central’s detailed choreography breakdowns and practice moves. But as a party game, for me Just Dance wins out every time. It’s gloriously silly, colourful, riotous fun, and it has the magical power to make people want to dance before the usually mandatory two glasses of wine. Technically it’s never been the most accomplished dance game around, but it’s always been the most fun, and Just Dance 2014 continues its fine tradition of wonderfully outlandish costumes, easy-to-follow moves, and energetic personality whilst ramping up the production values and choice of modes. Track-list wise, Just Dance sticks closer to modern pop than any previous entry in the series – its 47-song list is dominated by the likes of One Direction, Katy Perry, Nicky Minaj and – finally – Lady Gaga, but there’s some ABBA, Village People, Bob Marley and, um, Daft Punk for variety. When Just Dance started off it couldn’t afford original songs, let alone original current songs, but now it’s bursting with them. There’s no way any of this stuff would make its way onto my iPod, as I’m tediously earnest in my musical taste, but it’s still fun to dance to.   It is, as ever, the choreography that makes Just Dance 2014. There are no motion-captured 3D models here – instead there are videos of real dancers, captured in all their vivacity and energy, inviting you to mirror their moves. It plays a clever psychological trick: because you’re following the moves like you’re looking in a mirror, it makes you feel like you might actually look like the professional dancer, even though what you actually look like (gifted dancers excluded) is a drunk person flailing at your TV in your living room, gut peeking ever so slightly over your trousers when you stretch your arms towards the ceiling. The routines – accessible, silly, and endearingly creative – regularly made me laugh out loud. It’s the songs designed for two, three, or four that really shine. There’s a Ghostbusters routine where one of you is Slimer, a Ke$ha song that has one person riding around on the other’s back for a while, three-person choreography for Careless Whisper, an I Kissed a Girl routine that is sure to lead to some epic house-party awkwardness, and ludicrous alternate mash-up versions for several songs where the most outlandish moves and costumes dwell. Costumes include a giant panda suit, a hippo head with a little bowler hat perched on top, a Gundam robot vs. a cat-eared anime girl, Russian hats, bouncing wigs, gold chains, sheer dresses, awesome bodysuits, and smart waistcoats with skinny ties. In The Summertime features four dancers dressed as giant pieces of fruit. It’s a party foul that some of the best stuff, including most of the On Stage choreography designed for three or four people, is hidden behind an unlock barrier; the more you dance, the more versions of songs you unlock, including Battle mode mashups. The On Stage versions are a particular reward – they cast one dancer as the star and the others as backing dancers, and provide a stage for particularly ostentatious dancers to shine. They’re also brimming with sexual tension, an essential element of any classic party game from Truth or Dare to Twister. One evening of dancing with friends was enough to unlock most of what we wanted, but nothing bums out a party like “Sorry, we can’t play that one yet.” The Just Sweat workout mode hasn’t changed much since Just Dance 2, but the online features have gotten better and better. There’s a constantly rolling global dance-off called the World Dancefloor that you can join at anytime, dancing along with everyone else in the world to a pre-determined tracklist. It’s good for alleviating the decision paralysis that comes with a track list this big, along with the Recommended suggestions that pop up on the menu screens. Just Dance 2014 is out on Wii U, Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 right now, with PS4 and Xbox One versions coming later. Those later version will bring six-person dances into the mix, but amongst the current-gen versions there is remarkable feature parity. The Wii version looks worse than the others, lacking the HD sheen that shows off the Just Dance series’ ever-increasing production values, but all the online features are intact – and by the looks of things, it’s the version with by far the biggest uptake, so if the World Dancefloor sounds like your bag then it might be the best one to go for regardless.   The Wii U version has other advantages, though, like the ability to use the GamePad as a free-roaming camera or karaoke mike, and directing the evening with the pad brings things closer to a karaoke-booth feel. A Party Master mode also lets you direct dance moves with the pad if you’re that one person who always prefers to be on the couch than up dancing, which is especially entertaining when you jump wildly between Russian frog-leaps, the Charleston and Seventies disco. These minor advantages add up to make it the best of the three versions, and it's got an especial edge over the 360 version. Without something in your hands the relationship between what your body is doing and what Just Dance is telling you feels even more disconnected, and frankly I’m not sure Kinect really bothers to track your choreography much. With the Wii remote it only has to worry about one limb, and it can pretty much manage that. This is a problem that Just Dance has always had: the relationship between what you’re doing and how it scores you is pretty loose. It makes for enthusiasm and positioning, but it’s hardly precise. In all honesty, though, who on Earth cares? Just Dance is better at getting people and dancing than anything since alcohol, and my friends at least aren’t serious enough dancers to get twitchy about the scoring system. You could sit there on the couch and twitch the Wii remote if you wanted, but what would be the point? Just Dance 2014 exerts no pressure, and demands no skill. It just invites you to have fun with it, whoever you are and whatever music you like. It’s wildly silly, creative and colourful, relying on daft, characterful choreography and to evoke a party atmosphere that puts everyone at ease. There’s not a lot here that wasn’t in Just Dance 4, or even Just Dance 3, but the series’ talent for getting people up and dancing is still unmatched. Dancing is fun no matter what, but this game is a master facilitator of that fun, a catalyst for laughter.

Chuck Osborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/25/scribblenauts-unmasked-review	" Write it and they will come. Scribblenauts Unmasked: A DC Comics Adventure gives you the power to summon almost any hero or villain from DC Comics’ nearly 80-year history to help solve puzzles ranging from simple to deviously clever in this endearing, kid-friendly adventure. Its total freedom to create almost any object or character out of thin air emphasizes that your greatest superpower is your imagination. Solving puzzles as Maxwell, the Scribblenauts series’ rooster-haired protagonist, tests not only your creativity but your knowledge of the DC universe and its vast array of characters. It doesn’t require that you know the difference between the Golden Age Red Tornado (Ma Hunkel) and the modern android Red Tornado, for example, but familiarity with their existence and powers can enhance your experience exponentially. If a citizen needs medical assistance, why type in “doctor” when you can summon the sorcerer Doctor Fate instead? (Doctor Mid-Nite works, too.) Extra creativity will be rewarded with more reputation points that can be used to unlock new areas, superhero outfits for Maxwell, and origin stories for DC’s most famous heroes.  In fact, Scribblenauts Unmasked’s database is so packed with DC characters and iconic items - over 2,000 of them - that just browsing through the lot can be daunting. I’ve always considered myself to be a walking repository of useless DC trivia, but Unmasked showed me what a chump I am. There are characters in here so obscure that they may have only ever appeared once in the comics. Some available characters, like lovable rugrats Sugar and Spike, were published by DC Comics but aren’t even a part of its superhero universe. As a hardcore DC fan, I absolutely loved the incredible diversity and staggering breadth of DC toys to play with in this sandbox. (Fun Easter egg: Type in “Jim Lee” or “Geoff Johns” and you’ll summon DC’s creative bigwigs.) That said, there are some odd exceptions. Due to licensing issues, DC’s Milestone comic book characters like Static Shock have been excluded from the fun. The weirdest omission for me was when I needed the perfect hero to counter a villainous rampage by the frigid Killer Frost and attempted to call upon Sun Boy, one of the Legion of Super Heroes’ most prominent members, only to find him missing. The Legion is represented (heck, even L.E.G.I.O.N. is in there - remember them?), but poor Sun Boy got left out. That might sound pretty nitpicky to those of you unburdened by longboxes full of comics cluttering up your closets, but it means something to us geeks!  Of course, in the greater scheme of Scribblenauts Unmasked, a missing character here and there is pretty minor because there’s so much to work with. The appropriately cute story hinges on Maxwell and his sister Lily traveling to the DC Universe, where their world-hopping globe gets broken, releasing all its energizing starites into the hands of super-villains. It’s an excellent excuse for a team-up, as Maxwell meets Batman and joins up with the rest of the Justice League. Bats seems a little too quick to accept help from a preteen interloper with near limitless power for my jaded eyes, but - as is clear from Scribblenauts cutesy art style and presentation - this is a friendly adventure that’s fit for kids and adults alike. Even bloodthirsty killers like Doomsday and Mr. Zsasz are gosh-darn adorable. Longtime Scribblenauts fans shouldn’t be put off if they're not experts in DC lore. Solving Unmasked’s puzzles, which range from the mundane to the madcap, can often be accomplished through non-superheroic means by modifying an existing object or character in the world with an adjective or summoning a common item. For example, when tasked with helping Commissioner Gordon repair his police car, you can type in “wrench” and give it to him or tap on the car and add the adjective “fixed.” And if there is a puzzle that tests your DC knowledge, such as a request from a citizen to meet a winged hero, the Bat-computer’s database helpfully allows you to scroll around until you spot one (like Hawkman). Unfortunately, the index doesn’t allow you to search by attribute or power, but you can create and share any homemade hero or object with the easy-to-use Hero Creator in the Wii U and PC versions. Also, some adjectives that you might expect to find - like ""toothless"" for defanging a snake - are missing. That one's especially confusing since ""toothed"" is in there.  As you visit iconic destinations like Metropolis, Arkham Asylum, and Atlantis, the complexity level of an area’s puzzles ramps up considerably if you accept a challenge from the magical imp Mr. Mxyzptlk. He’ll set random restrictions such as only being able to use words that start with the letter ‘N’ or only typing up female heroes. Mxy’s kooky challenges are optional, but following his rules will reward you with double reputation points, and they definitely increase Unmasked’s replayability factor. The downside is that because of the dynamic puzzle system, his restrictions may make some puzzles in an area virtually unsolvable. But that’s the chance you take. And, hey, you can always return later - the puzzles will be different! The three versions of Scribblenauts Unmasked are virtually identical across the PC, Wii U, and 3DS, with the notable exception that the 3DS doesn’t include the Hero Creator but does have Streetpass support to unlock select hero costumes. Controlling Maxwell is a little bit easier on the Wii U and 3DS due to the D-pad, while the PC’s mouse-based movement proved to be clunkier (though you can also use WASD keyboard buttons, or plug in a gamepad). Targeting a specific character can also be troublesome when several are on screen at once, or obscured by text bubbles or other objects. Even after completing Unmasked’s 12 levels, which took around 10 hours, I feel like I’ve only scratched the surface of the creative ways to unravel its enigmas - which makes me want to keep playing it even more. It celebrates DC history with the most definitive database of heroes and villains found anywhere, and pushes your creativity and imagination in ways that previous Scribblenauts games don’t. It may be a little on the kiddie side for golden age comic book fans, but Scribblenauts Unmasked is a super way to exercise your mind as well as your love of DC characters."
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/17/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-hd-review	 Some fondly remembered game designs have aged poorly, but if I didn’t know that The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker came out 10 years ago on GameCube, it would be easy to believe that this HD re-release was a brand-new Wii U game. That’s how well this classic action adventure game holds up. (Here’s our original Wind Waker review from way back in 2003.) Its admirable longevity stems from excellent combat, charming characters, fun side-quests, inventive dungeons, one of the series’ best stories, and a cel-shaded art style that, while divisive, still looks great. For the re-release, Nintendo made very smart decisions about what to update and what to leave alone.  Back in the day, Wind Waker’s cartoony style came under fire for being “too kiddie.” But the joke’s on its critics, because while its contemporaries haven’t stood the test of time well, Wind Waker has refused to grow old. This timeless tale of a young boy searching for his kidnapped sister re-works classic lore from The Legend of Zelda into a thoughtful and heartwarming adventure that loops itself around familiar tropes. Visually, this new HD treatment isn’t much more than a texture update and a new lighting system, but it’s impressive and immersive. It’s noticeable from Link’s first steps on Outset Island all the way to the climatic final battle. The open seas look amazing in HD, and the increased draw distance really makes trips between islands feel isolated, but also intriguing. The many mysterious islands entice us to explore them off in the distance. The new lighting is sometimes a double-edged sword, though, creating the one giveaway that Wind Waker HD is older than it seems. In situations where Link is close to light sources or in dark areas, the soft shadows that wrap around him add a slightly weird volume to his character that looks strange and clay-like. It isn’t revolting, just distracting, as it stands out like a sore thumb in a heavily stylized world full of marvelous character designs. Nintendo came up with a clever and inspired interpretation when they adapted the well-known characters of the Zelda series into this anime-inspired art style. Take Ganon, for example. As a returning villain, the artists settled on a striking, samurai-esque look for his character; A visual foil to all of the pirates and sea-driven art direction used for this water-filled world. His flowing robe and samurai mask-like grin add an Eastern slant on a character I’ve seen plenty of times before. These small touches benefit other characters. Each one has a unique visual touch that adds personality and makes them memorable at the same time. Overall, Wind Waker HD has lost very little of its visual brilliance, and looks great whether you’re playing on the TV or the GamePad screen. Nintendo made some notable tweaks to adapt Wind Waker HD to Wii U, but most of its charming elements were there from the start. The wide-open overworld and great characters, for example, possess a level of charm and personality that holds up well against any similar modern games. The signature dungeons showcase intricate and inventive puzzle design that will be just as great in another 10 years.  Wind Waker’s signature dungeons start out simple, and build in complexity at a great pace. For example, the dungeon on Dragon Roost Isle mostly relies on the use of the grappling hook to travel across large platform gaps. But by the time I reached a late-game dungeon called the Earth Shrine, I had to use nearly every item in my satchel – including boomerangs, bombs, and hammers – together to move forward. Each room presents another crafty puzzle that requires careful observation. But Wind Waker’s best feature is its combat, and it's still the finest of any action adventure I’ve ever played. With a reliable lock-on system and lots of offensive combat options to counter, disorient, and disarm enemies easily, plenty of great weapons, and memorable foes, fights never get repetitive over its 30-hour length. An enemy encounter can unfold in a number of ways. Link can steal treasures using a grappling hook, or stun foes with a toss of his boomerang. He can gracefully counter incoming attacks, or freeze a baddie with an ice arrow and then finish them off with a thundering smash of an oversized hammer. Of all the incarnations of Link in the 3D era of this series, the young, cartoon iteration is the most capable fighter.  The enemies of Wind Waker might be considered easy when compared to beefier creatures found in other action adventures and RPGs, but few games present foes that blend animation and personality so well. That makes them a joy to fight. We’ve seen enemies like Moblins in other Zeldas, but they’ve never swaggered down a hallway with such expressive confidence, or had such a clearly dumbfounded look cross their pig-like faces when a grappling hook steals their precious skull necklaces. The way a disarmed enemy makes a mad dash for a weapon by one a powerful sword swing makes them feel like they have a real will to survive. Wind Waker applies similar behaviors and reactions to most of its enemies, making just about every encounter interesting. All that’s before we even start to talk about what’s new in this version. On Wii U, Wind Waker benefits from clever use of the second screen. The biggest boon is using it to swap out inventory items without having to pause, making the world feel more seamless and uninterrupted. I got an added sense of accomplishment from having an easy view of my completed sea charts and treasure maps available at all times, too. And for anyone who felt the original version was too easy, now there’s Hero Mode that doubles enemy damage, and makes it so that health can only be regained by drinking potions. It’s a challenging alternative for anyone worried they’ve outgrown this adventure.  Of course there are also smaller tweaks worth pointing out. The camera controls are much smoother on the Wii U’s controllers and feel like a vast improvement over the GameCube’s tiny c-stick. Other notable changes include sped-up animations and a retooled first-person camera. These improvements could be considered minor, but combined, they’re a noticeable improvement. That’s the beauty of this HD version: the developers have a light, but effective touch. As important as what's added, though, is what's been taken out. One of the biggest gripes back in 2003 was how much time you have to spend navigating the open seas; Nintendo heard that complaint and created a new swift sail, which decreases travel time by half. It’s still too long, considering ship-to-ship combat isn’t nearly as interesting as fighting with your feet on the ground, but I appreciate that change. Also, streamlining the Triforce fetch quest definitely helps pick up the pace near the end game relative to the GameCube version. Removing those two hangups makes Wind Waker an almost caveat-free recommendation. As a returning fan, I couldn’t have asked for much of a better treatment. The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker HD holds up as a marvelous game full of unique and wonderful surprises that remind me why it’s the best of the 3D Zeldas. If you’ve never braved this amazing seafaring adventure, the Wii U version offers the definitive way to experience a story that’s both charming and elegant.
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/18/the-wonderful-101-review	 A raucous, over-the-top tribute to Japanese TV shows like Kamen Rider and Power Rangers, The Wonderful 101 stars a team of Earth-defence superheroes who not only rescue imperilled citizens, but absorb them into a superpowered mob of little dudes. With an awkward squiggle of the finger on the GamePad touch screen, this gaggle of part-time heroes morphs into weapons, bridges, hang-gliders and more, letting you fight off endless invaders that range from plate-armored robot turtles to technologically advanced octopuses. It’s bursting with creativity and boisterous charm – but every superhero must learn to control his or her powers before they can be used for good, and Wonderful 101 doesn’t make that easy. This is a world of energetic, wild, colourful and silly action, with a playful sense of humour and a story that’s enjoyable despite the fact that makes almost no sense whatsoever – quite probably because of that, actually. Its characters are one-dimensional comic-book stereotypes: good-guy Wonder Red, chubby French Wonder Green, sexy whip-wielding vixen Wonder Pink. Their silly accents and competitive banter strike a kid-friendly tone, but the fearsome difficulty and occasional off-colour joke suggest that it has older players in mind.   The Wonderful 101’s 25-odd levels are two parts brawling with the odd situational puzzle thrown in and one part incredible boss battles. The bosses are definitely the highlight for me – they’re genre-bending and visually spectacular, they go on for up to 20 minutes, and you never quite know what to expect from them. One was a two-headed flying dragon, another has your rowdy crowd of heroes piloting one of two giant robots in a super-sized game of Punch-Out. Fights in general are chaotic, though, due to the inherent problems of picking out one small character among a crowd of dozens and the camera's varying perspective, so it can be difficult to even see what’s going on at first. My eye gradually adapted to the visual cacophony, but there were still occasional times where I was hit by something I couldn’t see, or where I’d momentarily lose track of my hero in the madness. If you've played one of developer Platinum’s games before, then The Wonderful 101's refusal to explain even basic things about how it works, like how to buy and equip upgrades or unlock new combos, may not come as much of a surprise. The resulting learning curve made getting into the groove tough: in the early missions, you’re thrown straight into the chaotic action with a tiny move set and very few instructions – and what little help you’re given comes in the form of occasional tutorial messages that are difficult to read whilst also trying to keep an eye on the action. Crucial moves like dodge and counter have to be bought from the shop, making the early game a frustrating experience. As things progress, though, you build up an impressive selection of abilities and weapons alongside a working understanding of the combat. After that, The Wonderful 101 matures into a fulsome, challenging, and satisfying action game with considerable depth to complement its increasingly wild ideas. For me, the initial few hours of my first 14-hour playthrough were painful, but by the fourth operation I was really enjoying myself. There are still things that remain opaque; you can switch characters around as you collect more of the Wonderful 100, and there’s a simple crafting system that lets you synthesise items from space vegetables, but both of these options are hidden away in menus and their workings and benefits are enduringly mysterious. Once you've got your head around how it works,  the biggest obstacle to enjoying The Wonderful 101 is the GamePad itself, which isn’t well-suited to general combat. When quick thinking and reaction speed are the difference between success and failure, or between a Gold medal and a Platinum one, the lethargic speed and accuracy of touch controls just don’t cut it. Whilst drawing simple circles, triangles and L-shapes on the Gamepad screen isn’t a problem, once you start getting into hammers, curvy whips, bombs and Z-shapes the GamePad frequently mistook one for the other, however carefully I drew. You can opt to use the right stick instead of drawing on the screen with a finger, but I found that option to be unusable for anything other than circles and straight lines. It works about 75% of the time, but that’s not good enough in an action game as fast-paced and challenging as this.   In combination with The Wonderful 101's high difficulty and reluctance to explain itself, this creates a frustration loop that's very difficult to break, and often made me want to throw the Gamepad through the screen. The control shortcomings are most evident in the frequent clashes with your doppelganger; where he can switch weapons and unleash super-combos in milliseconds, the controls meant that I never could. Other times, though,  The Wonderful 101 fulfils latent potential in the GamePad that other Wii U games have only hinted at before. There’s one especially brilliant section where you’re flying a spaceship on the TV from a cockpit displayed on the screen in your hands whilst fighting off enemies, and another where working the crowd of heroes through a maze on the GamePad clears a room of poisonous fog on the other screen. These scenarios don’t feel shoehorned in – they’re a natural break from the otherwise eye-meltingly relentless action, and they help The Wonderful 101 to feel entirely at home on its native platform. But the enduring problem is that even when you know exactly what you’re doing and multi-weapon combos and juggles are well within your capabilities, the controls will still sometimes let you down. The Wonderful 101’s levels are designed for multiple playthroughs and it grades you strictly on your performance, but the combination of demanding, precise combat and imperfect controls was frustrating enough that I didn’t want to go back to improve my scores. A lot of the fun in Platinum’s previous games comes from mastering them, but The Wonderful 101 lacks that appeal. I could never stay mad at the Wonderful 101 for very long. It's just immensely likeable, and so full of personality and verve that I couldn’t help but grow to love it. After that initial difficulty curve, there’s so much here that’s worth sticking around for – particularly the ending, which goes on for about two and a half hours and builds to a gloriously unpredictable crescendo of ridiculousness. The Wonderful 101 is both a showcase for the amazing potential of the Wii U’s GamePad and for its pitfalls. It’s amazingly inventive and full of color and bright-eyed character, but its control problems are so persistent they’re unignorable. Even that doesn’t ruin what is otherwise a clever and adventurous action game, but The Wonderful 101 is kept from being as truly wonderful as it might have been.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/18/disney-infinity-review	 Disney Infinity attempts something really ambitious: translating the principles of the childlike way in which we play with toys into a video game. And so it lets you build whole new worlds where logic is an infrequent guest, and then gives you the power to knock them down and start again. It wants you to go on new adventures with the toys you own, but it also wants you to reenact the scenes that made you fall in love with them in the first place. It’s crammed with creativity and variety, and I think, above all, it just wants to make you smile. And it succeeds, time and time again. Infinity is neatly divided into two complementary parts: the Play Sets and the Toy Box. Again, it’s all structured around how we think of toys as kids, or at least how I did. The Play Sets are mission-based adventures – the closest Infinity has to a straightforward campaign – and each take place exclusively within a single Disney movie setting. When inside a Monster’s University Play Set, don’t expect to see Jack Sparrow sauntering across the manicured campus lawns. Those kinds of lawless mash-ups are reserved for the Toy Box, a level-editor where you’re free to create your own adventures.  And that’s the key to really appreciating the magic of Disney Infinity: you don’t play as Jack Sparrow; you play as the toy version of Jack Sparrow that comes in the box (he still has the boozy pirate’s wayward swagger, of course). And that toy comes to life and is transported into the game the moment you place it down on the Infinity Base, a peripheral that plugs directly into your console. The toys themselves are well-made statues; they’re not poseable, but each one really captures the personality of that character with a charismatic stance. The toys have their own unique style that sparked desire in my inner Disney fan. It’s a good thing, too, because Disney Infinity is really all about celebrating the wonder of toys, and that concept is really sold through some lovely deft touches. For instance, Jack’s just a tad too short to see clearly over the helm of the Black Pearl; the robots you fight as Mr. Incredible have visible battery slots; and or when you “die” you break apart like a neglected plaything. These really are toys that have come to life. The Starter Pack comes with three Play Sets, one for each of the three characters included: Jack Sparrow, Sully, and Mr. Incredible. Sadly, there’s no place for classics like Donald Duck, Snow White, or Peter Pan as a fully playable character. Classics still appear – Mickey welcomes you at the beginning (and has now been confirmed as an additional character) – but Infinity is definitely pitched more at a contemporary audience. My biggest fear going into Infinity was that each of the Play Sets would be very similar, differing in largely superficial ways. I was very wrong. Each Play Set really embraces its unique setting in a way that shows not only an abundance of imagination but also a canny respect for its source material.  Pirates of the Caribbean is a swashbuckling adventure, with hack-and-slash combat, some nifty Uncharted-inspired platforming and puzzle solving, and naval warfare on the high seas (which is every bit as good as Assassin’s Creed III’s  for my money). And if that wasn’t enough, it has a Kraken and equips you with canons powered by voodoo. The Incredibles, meanwhile, is a complete change of pace: an open-world superhero game, in which you help the helpless, drive cars, and learn how to powerslide, traverse roofs, glide through the air using a wing-suit, and drop-kick a Panda back into a zoo. But there’s more: have to build your own superhero base, select what building to buy, figure out where to place them, and how to customise them. Although still varied, it’s probably the least captivating of the three sets – Metroville just isn’t that interesting. What’s the point of an open-world if you don’t want to explore it? Monsters University is the real standout, though. In many ways it’s an ideal adaptation of that film, succeeding where a more straightforward movie tie-in would fail. Under no obligation to recount the film’s plot beat-by-beat (in fact, none of the Play Sets are) it has the freedom to do something much smarter; it captures the spirit of the source material by translating it into a gameplay experience that makes sense. Monsters University is a stealth-action game, which sees Sully infiltrating the campus of rival institution Fear Tech, stealing mascots and defacing statues. You’ll “take down” Fear Tech jocks by sneaking up behind them and scaring them senseless. Playing on the Fear Tech campus is a treat – you don’t really get to see it in the movie – but it’s been realised with great thought. It has all the architectural inferiority of a new-build compared to the august institution of MU, and that attention to detail that runs throughout the game. Everything you unlock goes straight into the wonderful Toy Box mode. Part Minecraft, part LittleBigPlanet, Toy Box lets you not only build worlds, but design your own games. I spent most of my time creating a huge pinball table out of the Monster’s University campus, a third-person shooter set in a Pirates of the Caribbean port, and a race track that weaves in and out of Cinderella’s castle. Right from the start you have a healthy range of building items, which quickly expands once you gather new ones from the Play Sets. Materials range from a simple blocks and shapes to huge pre-built items (like Cinderella’s castle). Building isn’t always the easiest, though: it’s sometimes fiddly to line-up pieces – they don’t always snap into place – and when building on a large-scale this can quickly become frustrating and time-consuming to rectify. (The Wii U's GamePad makes rummaging through your items slightly easier, but doesn't really improve the overall experience.) Additionally, pieces of terrain can’t be overlapped, so if you don’t have a clear idea of what you want to build in advance, you’ll soon encounter situations where blocks conflict and can’t be placed down. It’s also really annoying there’s no undo button, especially considering how easy it is to delete something. Connecting switches and dynamic items like doors and fireworks is really intuitive, all done with the assistance of a magic wand, and that’s down to a clear interface and tutorials that do a great job of laying down the basics.  The elephant in this particular room is that this is a review of the Disney Infinity Starter Pack, which rightfully implies there’s a great deal more to this that’s not included in the purchasing price. Understandably, it’s been scrutinised for the amount of content that’s available before additional purchases rear their ugly heads, but on the whole I found the Starter Pack to be an incredibly generous experience on its own. Each Play Set’s campaign lasts around four hours – add another hour or so if you want to complete every side mission and challenge – but there’s plenty more to do. Just when I thought I knew what the Monsters University set was all about, I got a bike and discovered an entire BMX course waiting around the corner. Then there’s a little hut on the MU quad which let’s you combine gruesome items – bat wings, tentacles, claws, and so on – to create your own monster. It exists for no other reason than because it’s fun, and Disney Infinity understands that pure fun doesn’t need an objective. However, one of the most prominent aspects of Infinity is the character you get control, and after a while I did end up longing to play as someone else – especially when everything from the box art to the cutscenes teases you with tantalising cameos, like Mike turning up in nearly every Monsters University cutscene only to disappear when the game resumed. It’s also a genuine shame you can’t play co-operatively in a Play Sets locally without buying an additional toy from that world – that’s the only thing you have to pay extra for that I really feel should’ve been included. That frustration aside, the lack of additional characters or items never really compromised my single-player experience – sometimes you’ll come across gated areas accessible only with characters that you have to buy (video advertisements pop up, which comes across as a little on-the-nose) but usually it’s just extra points or an additional character-based challenge that you’re missing out on. I know some will have a problem with extra content being present on the disc that is inaccessible without further investment, but I feel the Starter Pack presents more than enough to justify its price. Ostensibly toys are brightly coloured pieces of plastic – that’s true of the three bundled with Disney Infinity – but I’ve always regarded them as something more. They’re catalysts of imagination, letting children picture new worlds with the help of an initial spark. At its very best, Disney Infinity fuels that process but introduces the added fun of video game tropes and genres into the mix. In fact, it’s an excellent primer for kids embarking on a life playing games – it’ll teach them everything they need to know about barrel-rolling in a third-person shooter, power-sliding around corners, or judging line of sight in stealth games, and so much more too. It’s an enchanting experience that succeeds in adapting one of the richest fictional universes into a surprisingly rich game.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review	" Hanging from a ledge on a balcony, I pressed the Back button on the Xbox 360 gamepad and grizzled superspy Sam Fisher drew an armed guard closer with a whispered a come-hither taunt. Decision time: do I toss an incendiary grenade at his feet and watch the flesh cook off his bones? Tear gas him and then run up and slit his throat? Simply aim my pistol at his face and paint the wall with his brains? Nah, I’m an old-school Splinter Cell purist, so instead I tapped the X button. Fisher reached up, grabbed the bad guy by the shirt, and hurled him over the edge to the concrete below. No one heard. That rush of having so many tools to choose from and the intoxicating freedom to execute a plan as I saw fit is the biggest part of what makes Splinter Cell: Blacklist the best game in the series since 2005’s Chaos Theory. Very obviously an olive branch to hardcore series fans like me who were left dismayed by the franchise’s action-heavy pivot in 2010’s Conviction, Blacklist gets stealth right. (In Conviction, scenarios like the one described above don’t happen and features include built in a win button called Mark and Execute that kills up to four enemies instantly with no stealth or aiming required. Facepalming in your living room is optional.) Blacklist still has the auto-kill move, but it returns Fisher to his rightful place in the dark – though yes, there are some daytime missions. The forgotten Splinter Cell element of verticality is back, too, with ample ceiling-mounted pipes to shimmy along and ledges from which to dangle above bad guys – all the better to rain down a beating. Levels are laced with air ducts aplenty to crawl through and multiple paths to explore, all of which combine to form a sublime stealth sandbox.  Of course, it’s expected that a Splinter Cell game should give us a quality stealth experience, but what’s really impressive is that if you want to play Blacklist the way we were forced to play Conviction, you can. Between its fluid aiming and excellent camera controls it serves as a capable shooter. Silenced pistol shots to the face drop targets with a satisfying “Tss-eew,” while shotguns thud rounds into bad guy chests with authority. On a related note, one particular twist in the campaign (you’ll know it when you get there) feels more jarring than refreshing, but is mercifully short and still able to be played stealthily. We’re effectively incentivized to play and replay in different ways by a post-mission scoring system – another feature clearly inspired by Chaos Theory – that tracks everything you do and credits you points in one of three categories: Ghost (non-lethal stealth), Panther (lethal stealth), or Assault (loud and lethal), each with associated achievements/trophies.  This multi-prong approach to level design is half of what makes Blacklist both a phenomenal stealth game and a smooth action one. The other half is the character customization, which allows you to spend cash earned by executing stealthy tasks (like stashing enemies in dumpsters) to specialize Fisher’s gadget and weapon loadout to suit your play style. I made a full Ghost variant, decked out with non-lethal gadgets like sleeping gas grenades, sticky shocker proximity mines, and a crossbow that flings disabling darts, but there’s plenty of deadly equipment available as well. It’d be a better system if cash weren’t handed out quite so generously. Particularly if you mix a few of the co-op missions in with your campaign playthrough, you’ll almost always be able to take the exact loadout you want into any mission. If it’s not going to make us choose between gear and make sacrifices based on budget, why have an economy system at all? Considering that this is a fairly easy campaign by classic Splinter Cell standards (even played on Perfectionist mode) it could’ve used that extra element of making tough choices.  Still, the equipment helps boost Blacklist’s gameplay to highpoints in the tense moments when quick thinking gets you out of a jam. For instance, at one point I was be about to be discovered by a Heavy foe (an armored brute immune to sticky shockers and gas grenades and is only vulnerable from above or behind) closing on my cornered position. I switched to my sticky noisemaker gadget and tossed it behind the Heavy; when he turned to investigate the strange noise I was able to sneak up behind him and choke him out, avoiding a noisy confrontation. The campaign only stumbles in a few areas – spots where we’re so outnumbered that it’s clear the designers intend for us to use Mark and Execute in order to thin the herd. Completing them non-lethally is an exercise in frustration for Ghost players, though it can be done. Fortunately, these moments are few and far between, and most are friendly to all styles of play.  Between those missions, Fisher’s airborne base of Fourth Echelon operations is cleverly used as the game’s menu. You can walk around the aircraft, talk to your team members – all of whom have new things to say after each level – and see your stats on in-game monitors. If only it were all easier on the eyes. Any character not named Sam Fisher is rather ugly, with very little facial detail and awful hair. That just can’t be ignored in the plentiful pre- and post-mission cutscenes, most of which suffer from rampant distracting screen tearing in the 360 and PS3 versions and framerate stuttering on the Wii U (Speaking of the Wii U, you're able to quick-select gadgets and weapons on the GamePad. It's quicker than the ""hold the D-pad"" method required on the 360 and PS3). Out on missions the environments look adequate, but Blacklist fails to impress, let alone dazzle. At least it can claim story superiority over the rest of the series. Blacklist’s terrorism-in-America plotline is grounded enough to be believable and its villains developed and human enough to not seem cartoonish. It uses Splinter Cell’s continuity to great effect as well, bringing back characters and story threads from Conviction in a way that strengthens Fisher’s motivations.  It’s difficult to understand the motivations behind the quasi-reboot of Sam Fisher himself, though. Oh, he’s still Sam, and nothing about his character’s backstory has overtly changed. But veteran voice actor Michael Ironside is gone, taking his distinctive baritone and sarcastic wit with him. In his place is a rather generic “I’m the boss” take on Fisher that’s gone from grumpy to full-on angry and whose tension with his crew isn’t nearly as interesting as their fraying emotions with each other. By the story’s climax, nearly everyone is angry at each other, but they’re forced to work through their frustration for the good of the mission. It’s a rare case of character relationships successfully complement the drama of a video game plot. New lead actor Eric Johnson can’t really be blamed for Fisher’s shortcomings. He’s saddled with a mediocre script, and in fact his only real crime is being miscast. He sounds 30 because he is (34, technically), despite Sam Fisher being depicted as a mid-to-late 40s combat veteran with graying temples and a daughter in her 20s. When Fisher’s on the phone with her, it just sounds...wrong.  Naturally, in Blacklist’s riveting pair of multiplayer modes all character concerns go out the window. The 14-mission cooperative campaign is practically another game’s worth of content unto itself. (Technically only the four Briggs missions require two players. The rest can be tried as solo challenges if you like.) More Splinter Cell is always appreciated, though it’s strange that these are all designed in such as way that active cooperation is almost entirely optional. Only once – when my partner and I had to simultaneously shimmy up pipes on opposite-facing buildings in order to coordinate a synchronized dispatching of snipers in windows who would’ve blown the opposite spy away had either one of us faltered – did I feel like I was truly cooperating with my partner. The rest of the time it felt like more of a two-player mode than a co-op one, though in Blacklist’s open-ended playground it’s still a treat to tag-team a group of bad guys. Yes, there are buddy moves like a boost and dual breach, but it’s nothing like the tight-knit teamwork required in Chaos Theory’s groundbreaking co-op mode.  Perhaps recognizing this, the designers split Blacklist’s multiplayer missions into batches of three or four, with each set assigned by a different member of your Fourth Echelon team and reflecting that person’s play style. Charlie’s quartet of scenarios are a Horde mode in which you must survive wave after wave of progressively more difficult opponents, while Grim’s ops are pure ghost jobs that are failed if you’re spotted. I much prefer the latter myself, though I appreciate the variety. Even the Charlie missions are a hoot to tackle in different ways – non-lethally one time, then guns-blazing another. The only mission that falls flat is the second of Briggs’ set, which devolves into an exact rip-off of Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2’s classic AC-130 Spec Ops mission where one player rains missiles from above and the other tries to survive on the ground. We’ve just seen that one too many times, and it’s a misfit in a game that’s supposed to be about stealth. It’s the long-awaited comeback of asymmetrical multiplayer mode Spies vs. Mercs – last seen in 2006's Double Agent – that’s likely to be the most enduring portion of the powerful Blacklist package. It pits Fisher-esque spies (playing in third-person view) against slower, well-armed Mercenaries (playing in first-person). In both the 2v2 Classic mode that mimics the original Pandora Tomorrow mode as much as possible and the new 4v4 Blacklist version (that adds customizable loadouts) the cat-and-mouse battles between the diametrically opposed classes makes for some of the freshest multiplayer in gaming today. You’re wholly dependent on your partner in Classic, though the larger player groups in Blacklist mode invite welcome chaos as the spies try to hack the terminal and the mercs try to stop them.  All in all, though, the new Spies vs. Mercs is not quite as good as its progenitor because it lacks some of the more inventive features. For instance, neither team has gadgets that enable them to listen in on the voice chatter of their rivals, nor can the spies grab mercs from behind and taunt them over the mic, but it’s an impressive modernization. It plays much faster than ever – spies can slit the throats of their foes with a run-by tap of the X button, for example – and most if its game modes are home runs. Team Deathmatch is the exception to that. It allows you to have spies and mercs on the same team, but it’s both unappealing and confusing since you’ll have a tough time deciphering who’s a friend and who’s a foe. Uplink, on the other hand, is where the mixed teams shine, as tug-of-war control points organically funnel all of the action to one hotspot, and here cooperation between classes allow for more creative and intelligent strategies. I’m going to be playing this for weeks, if not months, just as I did in Pandora Tomorrow and Chaos Theory. Splinter Cell: Blacklist is a sweet middle ground between the Panther-like action of Conviction and the Ghost-like stealth of Chaos Theory. The delightful improbable success of this compromise is a testament to game design that always has choice in mind. It’s well worth replaying the campaign with an alternate playstyle, a different set of preferred gadgets, and/or on Perfectionist mode. And, like the series’ Chaos Theory peak it can’t help but be compared to, Blacklist’s also packing a pair of multiplayer modes that could stand proudly on their own. Splinter Cell is back on the right shadowy track."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/ducktales-remastered-review	 As a child of the late '80s, DuckTales is something I hold near and dear to my heart. Like G.I. Joe, Captain N, and TMNT, the very thought of it sets off a nostalgia bomb in my brain. It brings me back to my childhood, where I’m pretty convinced everything I saw, watched, and played was better than whatever kids are occupying themselves with these days. Then again, nothing clouds memories like nostalgia, and that’s where talking about DuckTales: Remastered gets dangerous. The thing is, the very existence of WayForward’s HD remake of Capcom’s classic NES platformer – 20 years after the last episode of the cartoon aired and 23 years after Capcom released the game – begs a simple questions: was NES’ DuckTales really as good as we remember? Reluctantly, I have to conclude it only holds up pretty well. To its credit, WayForward has done an expert job of crafting its own spin on DuckTales, at least when it comes to how faithfully Remastered compares to the original. It is, at times, a screen-by-screen recreation of Capcom’s non-linear classic, right down to enemy and hidden treasure locations. It isn’t just guided by the NES original; in many ways, it is the NES original, just with a shiny new sheen. It will be instantly recognizable to fans, especially when it comes to its reworked, totally awesome soundtrack.  But there are a list of things that DuckTales: Remastered gets wrong, not only in some of the liberties WayForward decided to take, but in the reality of what Capcom’s DuckTales has always been. The fact is, DuckTales is still a great NES game – I went back and played it for roughly the millionth time when reviewing Remastered just to be sure – but it doesn’t fully translate to the 21st century, and frankly, it’s just not as epic as we remember. While Mega Man, Castlevania, Zelda, and Mario fully stand the test of time, DuckTales doesn’t. That means DuckTales: Remastered is fighting with deficiencies inherent in the original. That doesn’t mean Remastered is a bad game; in fact, it’s quite good, with a lot of things going for it. The original DuckTales was created on the NES Mega Man engine by the core team that made those games, so it comes as no surprise that its hallmark, like Mega Man’s, is non-linearity. Five core stages can be visited in any order, culminating in a sixth and final stage. What made DuckTales stand out at the time was that its non-linearity was carried over into the actual stages. There are hidden paths and areas galore, lots of secret treasures to find, multiple endings, and plenty of reasons to see it all over again. Remastered has all of that, and it makes playing it a pleasure, since you can rush on through or explore every nook and cranny. Meanwhile Scrooge McDuck, DuckTales’ filthy rich protagonist, looks great (no more off-model red coat!) and is wonderfully animated. Indeed, WayForward really outdid itself with the overall look of Remastered. Characters ranging from Launchpad to Fenton look amazing, and even Scrooge’s nephews Huey, Louie, and Dewey, while mere palette swaps of one another even in the cartoon, all have personality courtesy of Remastered’s full voice acting. The voices are really nice touch – original actor Alan Young makes his return as Scrooge’s voice and knocks it out of the park in the process – but it’s an alarming emphasis on story that begins to unravel Remastered.  Hopping around Transylvania. WayForward decided to make the plot a gigantic part of DuckTales: Remastered to the point that it becomes intrusive, stymying, and annoying. The introductory scene with Scrooge and company is fun, and the opening tutorial stage – totally unique to this version of DuckTales – is oft-interrupted, but understandably so. But by the time you get into Remastered’s short roster of stages, the constant disruption reaches a fevered pitch. It seems like every 10 seconds Scrooge has something to say, or some long, drawn-out conversation to have with someone. Pressing start and skipping cutscenes becomes a regular occurrence as a result, especially since Remastered doesn’t even remember if you’ve witnessed a cutscene before. The story quickly goes from complementary to obnoxious. Remastered feels as refreshingly unique as the original, with a complete lack of guns or projectile attacks (save the occasional rock smash, of course). Remastered is also as difficult as the original, though the playing field isn’t always level. Its design suffers from an inordinate amount of cheap collisions with enemies and obstacles alike, and even when using the new simplified pogo-attack option WayForward added to make it more accessible to new players, controls aren’t always responsive. Indeed, be prepared for some frustration as Scrooge occasionally decides not to react to a button press, even when it’s the same exact button you’ve been pressing for the whole game.  In the plus column, I give WayForward credit for its reworked boss battles, which are an excellent addition. In Capcom’s original, boss battles were typical NES fare, but Remastered makes each of the seven bosses feel unique and challenging. They, too, suffer from some of the same control problems mentioned earlier, but that means there’s something unexpected for long-time fans to encounter at the end of each level that builds on the original and twists it in a creative way. Unfortunately, WayForward went a little too far with one post-boss twist, which is so frustrating and cheap that it’s worthy of a classic 1980s controller-throw. You’ll know what I mean when you get there. Remastered does do a nice job of giving us lots of extras, with multiple difficulty levels, hardcore-baiting achievements, unlockable concept art, sketches, music, and more. Further options would have been nice – such as ways to facilitate continues so you don’t get booted back to the stage-select screen after losing all of your lives – but such is a fact of old-school gaming life. DuckTales: Remastered is tough, just like the game that inspired it. Don’t go in expecting anything else. The DuckTales cartoons might not be hot anymore, but DuckTales: Remastered is, in most ways, as good as Capcom’s legendary NES platformer ever was. It comes packing a few twists, some better than others. Refreshed boss fights are a nice touch, but Remastered’s confounding emphasis on its story is disruptive and annoying, even if it comes packing some great voice acting. Like the original, DuckTales: Remastered should be all about the action, not spending a ton of time in menus skipping cutscenes you already watched ten times. Still, DuckTales: Remastered is a worthy purchase for those who have experience with the original and are looking for a nostalgia rush. Just temper your expectations, because DuckTales simply isn’t as good as you probably remember.
Scott Butterworth	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	 What do you think of when you hear the name Cloudberry Kingdom? Whimsical Victorian-era JRPG? Cutesy browser-based tower defense game? Well surprise! It’s actually an old-school 2D side-scrolling platformer that runs you through a merciless gauntlet of procedurally generated levels. Not only can its various blocks and hazards be arranged in potentially infinite combinations, the difficulty can be ramped up all the way to “Masochistic.” It’s a brave approach, if nothing else. When our only means of avoiding doom consists of running and jumping, the entire experience lives and dies by the level design.   The good news is, CBK’s built-in level generator works extremely well, at least in a broad sense. Levels were never broken or unbeatable, and in fact, I routinely encountered sections that felt so deliberately assembled I actually doubted a randomized algorithm could design something so perfectly cruel. When you reach the end of an extremely challenging level only to discover a last-second laser from space means you’ll have to rethink your entire run in order to get the timing right, it’s hard not to take it personally, you know? Still, aside from the occasional level that far exceeded the difficulty of the previous and subsequent levels, the challenge always increased at a steady, satisfying pace. And damn can it be satisfying! The only problem is that the experience becomes predictable even as it grows more challenging. Nailing the exact timing of a complex series of jumps and dodges requires expert hand-eye coordination, sure, but my approach never changed when facing a new level: wait half a second at the start, then hold forward and do not stop. I could basically ignore every falling block and swinging saw blade and still make it from point A to point B unscathed as long as I kept moving and had faith there’d be something for me to land on. Occasionally I’d have to throw in a strategic pause, but it never took long to figure out where it needed to be (pro tip: usually after the third jump). As a test of dexterity, Cloudberry Kingdom is a worthy, well-executed tribute to traditional platformers. But because the levels consistently use such a clear pattern, the gameplay gradually grows repetitive. However – and this is important – this somehow never really deterred me from playing. I attribute this phenomenon to two factors. First, the levels are so brief they achieve near-Wario Ware levels of ADD addictiveness. This is further facilitated by the fact that the main campaign takes the Super Meat Boy approach and grants players infinite lives and instant restarts. It’s the epitome of “Just one more!” gaming – blissfully rewarding when it’s not totally infuriating. Mario's a pansy.  And the second factor: CBK offsets the unchanging design with variety in other places. For example, the story mode cycles you through various types of playable characters, providing a sense of discovery that the level design does not. There’s a double-jump hero, a hero in a box who can only move by jumping, a hero on a pogo stick who can’t stop jumping, a hero who inverts gravity instead of jumping, and even a “time master” hero whose movements control the motion of environmental objects (it’s very Braid). While you still basically sprint to the right without thinking too hard, the journey’s just different enough to remain interesting. Then there’s Arcade mode, which contains four game types that supplement the vanilla gameplay with various combo counters, timers, and other tasks that alter the underlying experience in fun, meaningful ways. On top of that is Free Play mode, which allows you to tinker with every imaginable setting to spit out a custom level which you can then save and force your friends to play. The lack of online sharing in the PS3 and Wii U versions is a severe disappointment, but this mode alone can provide hours of entertainment. Oh, and there’s local co-op. It doesn’t change anything, but New Super Mario Bros. did it so hey, why not? Epic beards and silly hats: check. Ultimately Cloudberry Kingdom compensates for the predictability of its level design. Unfortunately, not much can save its presentation. While the graphics and music are by no means abysmal, it lacks a clear identity, almost as if the art direction came as a total afterthought. Backdrops and foreground objects look like they’re from completely different games (at least one of which is a poor man’s Scribblenauts), and the soundtrack simply cycles through the same handful of tolerable but generic tracks, never once employing music to create tension or atmosphere. The biggest issue, though, is the lack of a unique, compelling personality. Where’s GLaDOS when you need her? As a love letter to platformers past and an open invitation to most hardened gamers out there, Cloudberry Kingdom succeeds admirably. Creative features inspired by classic influences help foster a hyper-addictive experience and thwart potential repetitiveness. While its technically impressive level generator ultimately doesn’t add a great deal, the intense, straight-ahead gameplay demands to be played and replayed for hours on end. It’s  a shame the developers couldn’t find a unique and distinctive voice for Cloudberry.
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/24/earthbound-review	" During an introspective moment, EarthBound reminds us that, ""There are many difficult times ahead, but you must keep your sense of humor."" That quote represents this seminal role-playing game's tone and pacing – it skillfully juggles a noticeable juxtaposition between moments of almost punishingly difficult battle against a dark Lovecraftian apocalypse and silly lightheartedness, and never makes you wait too long between them. Main character Ness and his compatriots combat sentient piles of barf, help two monkeys fall in love, stumble upon a planning meeting for EarthBound 2 (such a tease!), and so much more. It all comes together incredibly well. The true definition of a classic, EarthBound is as amazing and challenging a role-playing game today as it was in 1995.   EarthBound entertainingly wraps traditional RPG tropes in its 1990s setting. The party wields children’s toys like yo-yos, baseball bats, and toy guns to do battle against stray dogs, hippies, skateboarders and plenty of other foes. Rather than using a sparkling point on the ground or a plume of mystical blue light to save your game, Ness finds the nearest payphone to call his dad and record his progress. Money must be withdrawn from the nearest ATM, rather than retrieved from a stash. A number of references to the Beatles, the Blues Brothers, the Who, and plenty of others are dropped throughout, making Earthbound feel like a love letter to 20th-century Americana. The dichotomy between the serious and the irreverent also carries over to gameplay. While full of bright, cutesy sprites and charming music, EarthBound makes no apologies for being a very traditional (read: difficult) Japanese RPG. It might actually be at its most challenging in the beginning, when Ness is alone and under-equipped. It becomes less brutal as the party grows, but never easy. Inventory space remains incredibly limited, grinding XP is virtually a must, Ness and his friends have frustratingly low combat accuracy, and dying can invoke a pretty steep monetary penalty. While I found the challenge rewarding, it runs the risk of sending newcomers running for the hills. It'd be nice to at least have some visual stimulation while we're getting beat up on, but there's not much action. All you see is a still image of each enemy and spell effects against pretty psychedelic backgrounds. It isn’t the most exciting thing to watch, but thankfully each character is unique enough to keep decision-making interesting. There are refreshing deviations from RPG tropes, such as Paula's combination of powerful offensive spells with almost no healing ability whatsoever, and Poo's ability to mirror enemies and adopt their attacks. Even if there isn’t much visual feedback, maximizing the group’s abilities is a rewarding experience. Despite its age, EarthBound introduces innovations that, even today, feel incredibly smart and unique. The party’s health, for example, is represented by scrolling number wheels. Rather than having hitpoints instantly deplete with each enemy attack, the character’s wheel slowly spins down until all the lost hit points have been deducted. So if a character is dealt a fatal blow, there is actually a small window to heal him before he dies – to stop the bleeding, as it were. Watching that wheel spin toward zero while frantically trying to cast a healing spell is nerve wracking, and it amplifies the sudden calm that comes each time the clock is beaten. And, in a departure from JRPG tradition, there are no random battles. Enemies are always visible on the map, so you won’t have to worry about triggering battles at a bad time (like on your way to heal). Better yet, if the group vastly overpowers an enemy, it'll run away in fear. If you catch it, you'll simply automatically win. This makes revisiting earlier areas an absolute breeze, free of pointless lopsided battles.  However, the ability to avoid battles is really just an illusion of choice, as dodging combat will leave you vastly under-leveled when it comes time to fight bosses. Also, enemies respawn at a punishing rate. I can't tell you how many times I cleared an area of enemies, only to have them all reappear when the area went slightly off-screen. It's also a little surprising that the Virtual Console re-release doesn't smooth out some of EarthBound's technical hiccups. When more than two or three enemies are on the screen at once, things begin to stutter and slow down. I always know a large group of enemies is approaching because suddenly Ness is moving at half speed. But kudos to Nintendo for putting up the entire Player's Guide text online, even if it's a little unfortunate that it isn't included in the actual game itself. It does look nice on the GamePad, but I found that suspending EarthBound and switching to the Wii U's Internet Browser took a little too long. I was better off pulling the guide up on my nearby tablet. EarthBound is one of the most bizarre and memorable RPGs I've ever played. It balances its dark undertones with a sharp wit that is still mostly unrivaled today, and is full of ingenious ideas that buck genre trends. Though its punishing difficulty in its early stages might be tough to get past, EarthBound still remains one of the best, most unique RPGs to date."
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	 Unexpectedly for a game about being a squat little extraterrestrial on an alien planet, Pikmin 3 evokes a subtle, sweet nostalgia for its foreign world. Exploring its miniaturised woodlands and ponds recall childhood autumns spent kicking through leaves, or summer afternoons digging through soil to examine the bugs at the bottom of the garden. This beautifully organic planet is home to wonderfully inventive creatures unlike anything we have on Earth, but there’s still just enough familiarity to raise a smile when the aliens rechristen things like plums, grapes, and lemons as Lesser Mock Bottoms, Dawn Pustules, and Face Wrinklers. It’s this familiarity that makes Pikmin 3 emotionally relatable, and causes the ostensibly disposable pikmin themselves to feel like more than just units on the field. Their little squeaks and dying sighs made me feel guilty when I sent them to their demise by literally throwing them into battle, like I’d let them down. If you fail to round any of the wee guys up at the end of the day before the sun sets, you have to watch them getting munched by nocturnal predators as they make a desperate run for your departing ship, which made me feel like the worst person in the world. Nostalgic, evocative, and clever, Pikmin 3 is a delight while it lasts, blending strategic thinking, exploration, and life-or-death struggles against alien creatures – but it left me eager for more (and fearful of another nine-year wait between games).   Your interdependency with these cheerfully subservient little plant people is the emotional core of the series. Without food your explorers can't survive the next day, so pikmin carry fruits that you discover back to the craft for analysis, where salivation-inducing waterfalls of juice are squeezed from your spoils. When supplies are low there's a sense of urgency that enlivens the day's exploration. It’s at once frenetic and strategic, a second-to-second action game that demands foresight, caution, and a certain spatial agility that develops as you play, keeping map layouts, potential threats and different busy groups of pikmin in your head all at once. These are the same principles that made the last two Pikmin games so endearing. But it's very easy to build up a huge juice stockpile, so Pikmin 3 is only ever gently challenging in this sense. It  also doesn't have the original Pikmin's time limit or sense of danger, and that can detract from the drama. The fiendish final world is much more difficult, but it also works against the connection that you’ve established with your minions, eventually throwing you into a battle in which hundreds of them will die. It’s a saddening end to an otherwise cheerfully upbeat relationship. If they must be eaten, though, at least they're eaten by something impressive. Creature design is extraordinary, blending the recognisably natural with the creatively alien: bee-summoning hummingbirds, bulbous Bulborbs with their greedy mouths and tiny little legs, floating jellyfish, bellyflopping bug-eyed frogs, burrowing grubs and bugs masquerading as leaves. Most are beautiful, but all are dangerous. Only a well-balanced and sizeable group of pikmin will escape these encounters unscathed. It's only in battles against the biggest, most extraordinary creatures that Pikmin 3's few control shortcomings become obvious. There's a lock-on system, but it's unreliable. When strafing around a creature, sometimes I'd find my little spaceman would throw pikmin directly in front of him instead of at what the camera was locked onto. Pikmin aren't enormously smart, and unless you aim them precisely they'll often stand still and wait to be stamped upon or munched instead of running for their lives or attacking.   Precise aiming is more difficult with the Wii U's control stick than with the Wii Remote and nunchuck, which can also be used with Pikmin 3 – but without the Gamepad map you're at a gigantic disadvantage. This also unbalances the otherwise-excellent competitive multiplayer. In a mode where you have to check fruit and objects off a bingo card to win, whichever player has the GamePad has a massive advantage because they can see exactly where all those fruits are located. I couldn't help but observe a not-entirely-subtle environmental message as I explored Pikmin 3. Having burned through all the natural resources on their home planet, the planet Koppai send out a spacecraft to bring back food and save the population. The world they find is irrepressibly verdant, rich with greenery and huge, plump fruits that promise salvation for the homeworld. It's brimming with life of all kinds – except, conspicuously, civilised life; the kind that would probably destroy it. I also appreciated the teasing cleverness in Pikmin 3’s level design, which makes them consistently rewarding. You meet new types of pikmin as you explore these little garden maps: Rock pikmin smash through glass and crystal, yellow pikmin's invulnerability to electricity lets you used them as tiny conductors to power machines, blue pikmin can walk and fight underwater, and pink pikmin can fly. When you first arrive on a crash site, it is cleverly sectioned off by impassable rivulets of water or electrified gates; whenever you return with a more varied team, these obstacles fall in your path, more fruits and treasures come within your reach. I've yet to discuss the most important difference between Pikmin 3 and its forebears - that you’re actually three squat little extraterrestrials, not one - but that's because it turns out to not be as important a change as you'd expect. Split up after the crash, they are reunited after the first few hours, allowing you to divide your pikmin into three groups and explore different verdant corners of these giant gardens at once. The Wii U gamepad displays an unusually useful map, and scrolling across it, you can order different members of your team to different places whilst you take direct control of another. (Other than that the gamepad doesn't get much specific use, apart from an unintentionally terrifying first-person view that lets you see a crowd of pikmin staring at you eerily up-close.) Working together, these three explorers can throw each other across gaps and up ledges to open new pathways and avenues for the pikmin to use.   You’d think this would significantly change how Pikmin 3 plays... but it doesn’t, really. There are obvious three-person puzzles, but most of the time I found myself wandering around in one giant group rather than trying to take care of three squads at once; often I'd send a group off somewhere on its own only to find that half my pikmin had been eaten by an unexpected predator during the journey, so I quickly learned the value of a safety-in-numbers approach. What the three-character design does change is how you manage your time. With three squads, you can get more accomplished before the shadows start to lengthen and night calls you back to the spaceship. Pikmin 3's gentle difficulty mitigates its frustrations for the great majority of the time, but it ended long before I was ready to leave. Its worlds are gorgeous and intriguing, but there are only four of them before the dramatic final scenario intrudes upon your exploration, which for me was after 10 hours. The real challenge lies in the missions, little self-contained levels designed to really rest your capabilities either alone or with a friend. They are strategic, frenetic and smart, forcing you to make full use of all three space-people and even more different types of pikmin than appear during the main adventure. Pikmin 3 is a delight. There’s nothing else like its gentle combination of exploration, strategy and discovery, and it made me feel both empathy and responsibility for virtual creatures that most games would treat as disposable fodder. It transported me like few other games can, giving the feeling of being a stranger in a strange (but oddly familiar) world. It's over too soon, but it leaves a lasting impression.
Michael Burns	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/11/mutant-mudds-deluxe-review	 Mutant Mudds is one of the standout games on Nintendo’s eShops and PSN: an awesome 2D platformer featuring adorable, nostalgia-inducing pixel art and an infectious chiptune soundtrack. Now, the previously Wii U-exclusive Deluxe version has come to the PlayStation 3 and PS Vita, including the 20 remixed Ghost levels, off-TV play (for Vita owners), and all the great post-release levels created since the original game launched. Mutant Mudds Deluxe isn’t quite worth getting if you’ve already played most of its content elsewhere, but if you haven’t, it’s an excellent place to jump in.  Mutant Mudds was built for those of us weaned on 8-bit platformers, with enemy placement, gaps between platforms and secret areas all designed to push us to the absolute limits of the abilities it gives us to play with. Misjudged jumps, poorly timed jetpack boosts or errant squirtgun blasts almost always lead to death, but each death is a learning experience. Mutant Mudds never breaks its own rules or does anything to make us feel like we’re not in control. Still, you will probably die. A lot. To alleviate some of the frustration that comes with this, Mutant Mudds Deluxe adds mid-level checkpoints not seen in previous versions. These are a comforting addition for those of us who don’t have the time or patience to replay an entire level over and over again, but they come at the cost of the sense of accomplishment that comes from reaching the end of a particularly difficult level. Thankfully, checkpoints can be disabled. Fear not: Mutant Mudds hasn’t gone soft on you. Of course, retro-flavored platformers are a dime a dozen these days, and many employ gimmicks to stand apart. Mutant Mudds’ gimmick is its plane-swapping mechanic, which forces you to navigate back and forth between background and foreground platforms to make it through each level. It’s similar to Wario Land for Virtual Boy (which I consider the VB’s best game), or the more recent Shantae: Risky’s Revenge. In the original 3DS version, this mechanic made use of that system’s stereoscopic imaging capabilities to showcase some pretty inspired level design. The Wii U, PS3 and PS Vita obviously aren’t capable of replicating this feat, so to get around the problem Mutant Mudds Deluxe blurs out whatever planes Max isn’t standing on. It works for the most part, but with so many enemies buzzing around the various platform layers, I found it difficult to guide Max through some of the trickier levels as I was often preoccupied with trying to figure out which enemies I needed to avoid and which ones I could slip past.  There’s a lot of game here, though. Mutant Mudds has always been a completionist’s dream come true, with a wealth of hidden stages – homages to the Virtual Boy, Game Boy, and CGA-era PC gaming – locked behind out-of-the-way doors that only skilled players will access. Mutant Mudds Deluxe includes all of this content, and adds 20 new Ghost-themed levels to the mix. However, these new ones are basically just remixed versions of the main levels, with the only real difference being that enemies can only temporarily be killed with a special ammo type that’s in extremely limited supply. It’s a neat change from the established design as it forces you to navigate around enemies rather than blasting everything in sight, but the familiarity of the level layout makes the novelty wear off pretty quickly. At least we get some spooky new tunes to jam to. If not for the ineffective faux 3D effect, Mutant Mudds Deluxe would be the definitive version of Renegade Kid’s 2D platformer, with the same tight gameplay, charming graphics, and chirpy soundtrack bolstered by more levels than ever before. But are those new levels enough to justify another purchase if you’ve already played the original version? Probably not, but no matter how you play it, Mutant Mudds is a great game. Updated 12/20/2013 to reflect PS3 and Vita versions.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/27/new-super-luigi-u-review	 Don't download Super Luigi U looking for an explanation as to why Luigi's filling in for his shorter, redder brother. You won't get one, nor will you ever be clued in to why Luigi's picture is amusingly (and mildly creepily) hidden near-subliminally in each and every one of the 82 remixed stages. What you do get though, is a CliffsNotes version of a great fast-paced 2D platformer. All the same things that make NSMBU a good time are present here alongside the tweaks to the formula, including Luigi’s signature floatier jump. As a stand-alone game, its reliance on Luigi's control quirks to manufacture challenge might come off like a cheap trick, but as a piece of DLC for New Super Mario Bros. U, it functions as a sort of challenge mode, making it an enjoyable, (if somewhat pricey at $20) supplement to that'll give platforming vets something meaty to sink their teeth into.  Before you've taken a single step in Luigi's shoes, the first key change becomes apparent: you've only got 100 seconds on the clock. That nerve-wrackingly familiar “wrap it up” jingle plays the second the curtain rises on each stage, ensuring that you're off to the races from the get-go. Levels have been significantly shortened to compensate of course, but the psychological effect is strong, especially if you've been playing Mario games since the 1980s. Hurling Luigi recklessly forward is practically a Pavlovian response, and the new enemy and platform placements play on those instincts deviously. I only lost one life to an expired time limit during my playthrough, but anxiety over the constant countdowns claimed many a hurried Luigi. Luigi's worst enemy here is easily himself. He jumps like he's on the moon, and changes directions mid-air like a balloon in the wind. Coming to a stop after running and jumping at top speed is nearly slippery enough to feel like an ice level, so be prepared to watch the great green one sail off a lot of ledges and overshoot stomp attempts on a regular basis until you adjust. There's no shortage of areas sadistically designed with these foibles in mind, and while it ratchets up the difficulty factor appreciably, it also felt like I was fighting the controls just as much as the Goombas and Koopa Troopas. That pendulum swings the other way too though, and Luigi's higher jump and ability to float at the apex for a moment make previously impossible leaps into pedestrian fare. As frustrating as coming to grips with his awkwardness can be, it all melted away once I started exploiting the potential of his prodigious vertical and finding ways to completely circumvent situations that initially appear insurmountable. When I was doing it right it felt like having cheat codes activated, and after suffering a string of irritating deaths, soaring over any and all challenges can feel rather euphoric.  Once those moments start coming more frequently, the skillfully remixed levels begin to come into their own. Even without the new time constraints and physics, Super Luigi U would have enough to keep most platformer fans on their toes. The ideas are all familiar to anyone who's played through NSMBU, but they're ratcheted up to 11 in clever ways, and forced me to apply what I’d learned more adeptly than before. Tearing through the bite-sized levels becomes quick business once I got in a rhythm, but finding every secret and nabbing all the star coins will be a brag-worthy accomplishment for the more dedicated completionists out there. New Super Luigi U is the chance the taller brother has waited for since being relegated to “player 2” status so many years ago. Its smaller levels, restrictive time limit, and floaty physics work well as a challenge mode add-on to an already terrific game. But as fun as it often is, this still feels more like an addendum to NSMBU – a remix, rather than something new that stands on its own.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/27/dungeons-and-dragons-chronicles-of-mystara-review	 I have fond memories of 1990s coin-op classic Dungeons & Dragons: Tower of Doom as well as its sequel, Shadow Over Mystara. I remember approaching the Tower of Doom cabinet with a couple friends, pocketful of quarters in hand, and choosing the Dwarf. We’d voluntarily take the more dangerous road at one of the game’s many forks, despite not one but three warnings that this was a bad idea because of the red dragon waiting at the end of this path. But we knew the rewards were sweeter, even if it cost us a couple extra bucks’ worth of Continues.  Dungeons & Dragons: Chronicles of Mystara bundles both games into one $15 downloadable package for Xbox 360, PS3, and PC (via Steam). This release is especially welcome not just because these are such deep, story-driven experiences – even compared to most quarter-munchers of the era – but because unlike most other popular arcade games you can name, this is the first time they’ve ever been given an English-language re-release – only a Japanese-language disc made it to the ill-fated Sega Saturn in 1999.  The good memories aren’t just the nostalgia talking.  Fortunately, the translation is a faithful one and, it turns out, the good memories aren’t just the nostalgia talking. By preserving the original ‘90s look, Capcom and Chronicles developer Iron Galaxy – best known for Wreckateer and the more recent Darkstalkers revival – avoid mucking up what worked. (See Double Dragon Neon and TMNT: Turtles in Time Re-Shelled for prime examples of what not to do.) At the same time, they’ve added complementary modern features like four-player online co-op play, widescreen support, and in-game challenges on both consoles and PC. Of course, at their hearts, both Tower of Doom and Shadow Over Mystara are Golden Axe clones. You and up to three friends move from screen to 2D screen, pummeling any classic D&D foes like Beholders, Liches, and Manticores that cross your path as any of four uniquely skilled player classes (Fighter, Dwarf, Cleric, and Elf). But these tabletop-rooted adventures add so many more layers on top of that, such as magic spells, special abilities, usable inventory items, shops, an XP-based leveling system, and branching paths. In a sense, they are the original “action-RPGs,” and it’s still fun to hack-and-slash your way through the varied environments and enemy sets in 2013.  Each game is good for multiple completions thanks not only to the multiple player characters and branching paths already there, but to the newly added challenges (which, naturally, are also tied to Achievements/Trophies). These organically add a compelling twist to the core game and encourage additional run-throughs by offering campaign-altering, user-toggled extra rules as rewards. Standouts include Hedgehog, which makes you bleed gold instead of health (you die when you run out of gold) and Vampirism, which siphons health from your foes every time you land an attack. So what differentiates Doom and Mystara? As my longtime friend and D&D co-op partner Brian so accurately put it as we finished one of our playthroughs of both games over Xbox Live, “Shadows Over Mystara is like the Street Fighter II Turbo to Tower of Doom’s Street Fighter II.” And indeed, the sequel is clearly the superior of the two excellent adventures. The Y-button item selection menu is streamlined to be less intrusive on the screen, two extra (and welcome, thanks to the wholly different way they each play) classes join the party in the form of the Thief and the Magic User, and Mystara is even a decent chunk longer than its predecessor – clocking in at around 100 minutes for a two-player run compared to about an hour for Doom. Several visual options let you do everything from widescreen view to this -- a full arcade cabinet recreation, complete with scan lines. On a related note, it’s a bit strange that when you first fire up Chronicles you’re dropped into the Mystara menu by default. Yes, it’s the better game, and the story isn’t exactly crucial, but it is the follow-up chronologically. I recommend playing Doom first (press the Back/Select button to switch between the two) in order to maximize your 1990s time-capsule experience.  It’s either all couch or all online, with no blending of the two.  What yanked me out of my nostalgia-fueled euphoria are the random online disconnects that occasionally terminated my match, forcing me to replay entire levels. (Fortunately, you can start from any chapter once you’ve unlocked it.) More unnerving is the inability to mix local co-op with online. It’s either all couch or all online, with no blending of the two. This is a grave failing, nothing less. However, the gamut of reverent graphic options is duly appreciated. Smoothed-out, cleaned-up visuals are on by default, though you can do everything from toggling full widescreen to turning on artificial scan lines, simulating the interlacing of the coin-op cabinet’s CRT monitor. Heck, there’s even an off-center meta view, as if you were physically back in the arcade standing in front of the machine. Chronicles of Mystara’s long-awaited English-language home debut has been handled with great care, bringing us an experience that’s virtually identical to the arcades and successfully tugging at nostalgic heartstrings. It’s great to see these two former arcade-exclusive mainstays finally get the restoration they deserve.
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/06/21/game-wario-review	 If you were hoping that Game & Wario would show off imaginative uses for the Wii U gamepad that you could never have dreamed of otherwise, it's going to be a disappointment. Actually it’s a bit of a disappointment regardless. Of the 12 single-player minigames, three are brilliant, three are good, and the other six are forgettable. A few retread ground that Nintendo Land broke last year. Others are just gyroscope games that don't really make much use of the second screen at all. Game & Wario might be simple and surreal, but it's shockingly short-lived too, and unfortunately it doesn't have enough of the inventiveness and experimental feel that was previously the series' hallmark. The best of the lot is Gamer, which is a brief work of genius. You're a kid playing Game Boy in bed, hiding the console under the covers whenever you hear your mum coming to check on you. On the gamepad you're playing classic quick-fire Wario Ware madness, switching every five seconds between poking a virtual nose, flicking a tiny dancing dude off a spinning record and loads more mad quick-fire scenarios. On the TV screen you see the bedroom, watching for the parental approach. It divides your attention brilliantly, it's inventive, and it's evocative too. We all remember being that kid.  Pirates first surfaced as a Wii U concept demo in 2011. Here, it's become a rhythm game that has you spinning around to block incoming arrows with the gamepad in time to the music, marshalled by a disco-dancing sea captain. It's great fun to play and good fun to watch, making the most of the comedy potential of having you spin around wildly with a screen in your hands. Taxi, meanwhile, is a mind-scrambling driving game with a first-person view through the windscreen on the Gamepad screen and a big 3D map on the TV, tasking you with shooting down UFOs and delivering their captives to safety. It’s clever and innovative, reminiscent of Nintendo Land’s Metroid Blast, and one of the few minigames that’s worth returning to after the first playthrough to see new scenarios. All the minigames sprout new levels and difficulties after the first completion, turning them into more fulsome individual experiences, but I didn't really want to return to most of them, because I knew I'd seen all they really had to offer. What Pirates, Gamer, and Taxi have over the rest of the selection is their inventive use of the gamepad. Patchwork, by contrast, is a simple puzzle game where you move shapes into position with the stylus - nothing interesting going on there. Ski has you guiding Jimmy, he of the blue afro, down a slope by tilting the pad, which is equally uninteresting. There’s altogether too much tilting going on: four of the minigames use it, and none of them do so in an interesting way. It feels mean-spirited to call Game & Wario's presentation cheap, but... it's a bit cheap. We're talking sparsely animated 2D cutscenes with simple, colourful backdrops, but those cutscenes are at least cheerfully slapstick and entertaining. I blasted through the story in two hours, though, and had absolutely no desire to watch them again, and skipped them upon selecting a minigame to replay.  It is at least charmingly surreal. Game & Wario's characters are weird and visually distinctive, like the drawings of a particularly imaginative child in bright, hallucinogenic colours. Playing minigames earns tokens that you can exchange for bizarre trinkets from a giant chicken-shaped capsule toy machine. Some of these trinkets are microgames in themselves – a looping machine that uses the gamepad microphone, bits of paper with coded telephone numbers on that you can call for a weird conversation, a bizarre sketchpad. The loopiness that’s largely missing from the main game can sometimes be found secreted away in these unlockables. It’s a shame that it’s so well hidden. I was hoping that the multiplayer would really bring Game & Wario to life, as Wario Ware: Smooth Moves was a favourite party game round my house for months. But there are only four games on the multiplayer menu, and only two of them are genuinely fun in a group of four or five. Artwork is Pictionary in all but name, which is always a good time, and Fruits is an excellent whodunit where one player with the Gamepad is a thief and the other players have to spot them on the screen, creating enjoyable tension and suspense in the room. With all Game & Wario's multiplayer offerings, the real game is going on off the screen, between the players in person. Wario Ware was once bristling with creativity and energy, fizzing and sputtering with mad, short-form ideas, but Game & Wario is just a bit boring. The selection of games is sparse, and a couple of excellent ones don't make up for the rest. The Wii U is still waiting for its Wii Sports moment.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/31/sniper-elite-v2-wii-u-review	 Releasing for the Wii U more than a year after it arrived on rival platforms, you’d expect that this overly tardy port for Nintendo’s dual-screened console would at least be packing some shiny new features in order to justify the wait. And you’d be wrong. Sniper Elite V2 on the Wii U is a disappointingly cut-down version of what’s been available on Xbox 360, PS3, and PC since May of 2012. (Read our original Sniper Elite V2 review here.) Here, the online multiplayer modes are absent and the additional DLC content isn’t even an option. While the Nazi nut-shotting fun of the single-player game is still present and accounted for, Sniper Elite V2 is a substantially lesser package overall for Wii U fans, and that’s a real shame.   Aside from the obligatory shift of HUD and menu elements to the Gamepad screen, the Wii U version doesn’t feature much in the way of new gameplay elements to distinguish itself. Having a second screen dedicated to your map and weapon switching is a plus - being able to see where your enemies are at a glance definitely helps you strategise on the fly while you work your way through each war-torn level - but it’s not really a game-changing addition; it’s just an added convenience. This convenience is counterbalanced by the fact you can only play the game with the Gamepad - it doesn’t support the Wii U Pro controller - and personally I don’t find shooters to be that comfortable to play with the Gamepad’s tacky triggers and spaced-out sticks. The only other Wii U-specific feature is the option of taking the entire game offscreen via the remote play function. This is certainly a welcome addition to any Wii U game, but I would have preferred if developer Rebellion had employed the second screen as an option for offline co-op. Instead, the co-op multiplayer modes present on other platforms have been completely stripped out with no explanation, which greatly reduces its potential lifespan. That said, the eight-hour single-player campaign remains intact and features all of satisfyingly gratuitous slow-motion x-ray kills and advanced simulation settings (on higher difficulty levels) that make for a totally enjoyable and stealthy shooter, particularly at a time when the genre is so obsessed with modern warfare. It honestly makes for a nice change to return to WWII and take on Hitler’s goose-stepping goons once again. Speaking of which, the infamous DLC mission that allowed you to snipe the Führer‎ in the family jewels isn’t going to be offered on the Wii U eShop. In fact none of the DLC that supported the game on other systems is going to be available for the Wii U release, and nor are they included on the disc. All told the absence of co-op and DLC options means that this belated port feels a bit too much like it’s a day late and a Reichsmark short. Sniper Elite V2's gratuitous X-Ray kill-cam adds a macabre elegance to every perfectly-timed shot you make, and that gives your careful handiwork an appealing artistic flair. While the ground combat and close-up encounters aren't as tight as you might expect from a common shooter, the sniper gameplay is front and center here, and it's delivered with top-notch class and authenticity. Unfortunately the absence of multiplayer and DLC options in the Wii U version neuters V2’s lifespan like a Karabiner round to the crotch, so if you value those and have the option to play elsewhere you’ll have a better experience.
Taylor Cocke	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/20/resident-evil-revelations-hd-review	" When television went HD, newscasters around the country freaked out because viewers could now see them clearly enough to notice their unsightly blemishes. All that resolution created an image that was clearer, yet not as pretty. Similarly, Resident Evil: Revelations was regarded as one of the best RE games in years when it came out on the Nintendo 3DS last year, but it's had a harsh light cast on it in its shift from the tiny 4.88-inch screen of its native system to PCs and consoles. This ""upgraded"" version may be technically better looking, but a big high-definition screen and gamepad isn't the best way to play Revelations – it’s simply out of its element. Even on the PC version, levels look blocky. That’s not to say that Revelations has suddenly become a bad game, as everything that’s good about it is still here. It’s still a return to the classic formula from the first several games in the series,  and the stranded and brooding ship Queen Zenobia is still one of the best settings in a Resident Evil since the Arklay mansion. The cramped hallways in the depths of the ship aid the slow-paced suspense, with every corner a potential hiding spot for an Ooze monster. The story doesn’t make much sense, but it’s baffling in that charming way that the series is beloved for. There’s over-the-top dialogue, absurd political conspiracy theories, and flashbacks to moments that rarely feel more than tacked on. That is, until they’re explained away in hilariously awful, yet somehow charming tie-ins near the end. (Read our original Resident Evil: Revelations review for more on that.) This HD version shares all the problems its predecessor has, including noticeably limited enemy variety and weak allied AI that can't hit the broad side of a barn. Ironically, what actually makes this version feel inferior is the very thing it claims to improve upon. The graphics, which look stunning on that tiny 3DS screen, mostly look dated when blown up. Character models are the exception – they look great – but the environments are are full of flat, grainy textures to match the jagged, craggy geometry. And somehow, despite superior hardware, framerate issues still pop up in some of the more intense segments or when new areas are loading, across all platforms. Surprisingly, it also suffers when played with an Xbox 360 gamepad, both on the Xbox version and when plugged into the PC version. Where Resident Evils 5 and 6 feel like modern shooters, Revelations' aiming simply doesn’t feel smooth with a gamepad stick. I found my aiming reticle frequently jerking around the screen in a series of overcompensating movements. That's a problem I never had with the 3DS's Circle Pad Pro. Played with the mouse, however, it handles surprisingly well. Original Resident Evil: Revelations Video Review  Of course, even when controls are precise, the constant movement of the ship makes the cursor bounce all over the place, occasionally causing you to miss what was sure to be a clear shot. That uncertainty there gives a great sense of tension without feeling outright unfair, and that comes across just as well. Thus, I still found myself enjoying Revelations HD quite a bit, as all of the creepy atmosphere and quality scares aboard the Queen Zenobia are completely intact – and that's what I play Resident Evil games for. With its welcome return to classic-style horror action, Resident Evil: Revelations is very much worth playing in its HD form for its atmosphere and scares alone. However, if you’ve got the choice between the remake and the original, stick with the one you can carry in your pocket – this one feels a bit uncomfortable in its own skin."
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/23/assassins-creed-iii-the-tyranny-of-king-washington-review	 Note: This review evaluates the Tyranny of King Washington DLC as a whole in light of the third episode, The Betrayal. For more detailed thoughts on the individual merits of the first and second episodes, look here and here. The Tyranny of King Washington’s premise is one of the more interesting alternate-history interpretations that games have attempted. (Certainly more interesting than “what if Hitler had a mech suit?” at least.) Corrupted by a powerful Apple of Eden artefact, General George Washington has claimed the new nation for himself and continues to wage war on the native population and his political opponents. Ratonhnhaké:ton – who never became Connor in this double-alternate timeline – is determined to overthrow him, motivated by a sense of personal vengeance that later mixes with democratic ideology. It’s a fast-paced tale, running its course in around six hours over three episodes. The opening episode mines Ratonhnhaké:ton’s native American heritage for a new approach to AC3’s well-trodden frontier; the second leaves that behind and returns you to Boston for a slow couple of hours that build curiosity for the final act but doesn’t offer much in the way of new experiences. The third opens with a naval battle – easily one of the best things about AC3, and a timely tease for the upcoming Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag – as the final showdown in New York approaches.   If you were left feeling ambiguous about this DLC after the first two episodes – as I was – then the third goes some way towards redeeming things. Having spent those first four hours longing to see more of what the nascent America might have been like as a despotic dictatorship, I was pleasantly surprised to arrive in New York to see unrest on the streets, food shortages leaving the citizenship demoralised and desperate, and Washington giving chillingly fascist balcony speeches to crowds of his people atop a pyramid he’s had constructed as a monument to himself, an eagle-adorned crown resting atop his head. New York looks and feels significantly different in this DLC, in a way that the second episode’s Boston and the first episode’s frontier simply didn’t. There might not be much more to actually do, besides stringing Bluecoats up from washing lines as opposed to Redcoats, but there is an atmosphere of panic and oppression. The Betrayal is the only episode of this DLC that has a specially-made new area, too: Washington’s pyramid, an excellent playground for the wolf, hawk, and bear abilities that Ratonhnhaké:ton acquires by drinking the sacred tea of his tribe. The resulting futuristically trippy spirit-communion dream sequences and the powers that they bestow upon you are the most enjoyable parts of The Tyranny of King Washington. Outside of that, too many of the actual missions feel copy-pasted from Assassin’s Creed III’s main storyline, especially in the second episode. The wolf grants Ratonhnhaké:ton that famous lupine trait of, um, invisibility, letting you move unseen between hiding places. The hawk bestows upon him the power of flight, letting you flit Batman-esque across the rooftops of Boston and, later, New York, negating the need for climbing. Both of these abilities redraw the boundaries of AC3’s gameplay, significantly altering the way you can approach its challenges. On the third spirit journey, though, Connor meets with the bear, which essentially gives him a ground-pound. Admittedly it’s a very powerful attack, sending enemies flying and vulnerable structures toppling, but it’s hardly a game-changer.   It’s not too much of a disappointment, though. Where the first two episodes are heavily centred around their own particular new powers, the third necessitates that you use all of them together. It sends this DLC out on a high note, and perhaps inevitably, the third episode is by far the most narratively satisfying. The ending is a decent enough payoff to justify the time spent wondering what’s going on in the first two episodes. But I still feel like it could have done more with this fascinating concept of a young, idealistically founded nation gone horribly wrong. If you take the Apple of Eden to be a metaphor for the corrupting influence of power rather than a sci-fi doodad, then The Tyranny of King Washington does have the basis of something interesting to say, but it’s still thematically shallow. The Tyranny of King Washington’s production values may well set new standards for DLC. As evidenced by the literally 20 minutes’ worth of credits that roll at the end, this wasn’t dashed off in someone’s lunch hour; it has more than an hour of new cutscenes and significant new gameplay woven around AC3’s familiar locations and characters. But the price you pay for that is £24/$30 for around six hours of play, which will be unjustifiably steep for most. Even the season pass, which also includes pre-order bonus missions for the main game and multiplayer bonuses, hardly offers stunning value. It’s also impossible to overlook that not every hour of this short series is enjoyable. Episode 2 sometimes feels like AC3 at its worst: walking between cutscenes and completing tasks in which you have no real investment. It also doesn’t do anything thematically interesting with the alternate-history setting until the final episode – this is the best use of Animus technology I can think of, and it’s saddening that The Tyranny of King Washington does relatively little with it. The Tyranny of King Washington is made to the highest standards, but also overpriced for what it is. Though the new powers refresh and reshape Assassin’s Creed III’s gameplay, most of the locations and missions here are overly reminiscent of what we’ve seen time and time again in the main campaign, and only towards the end does the story really come into its own. It would be a much easier recommendation at half the price.
Audrey Drake	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/04/05/toki-tori-2-review	 Toki Tori 2 has finally arrived on the Wii U eShop – and for fans of adorable settings and satisfying puzzle gameplay, it was well worth the wait. With delightful graphics and remarkably simple controls, Toki Tori 2 succeeds at providing a content-rich, charming experience, and is easily among the best this new console’s digital shop has to offer.   One of the most impressive things about Toki Tori 2 is the way it teaches its mechanics without the use of tutorials – in fact, other than the title, there isn’t a single word of text in the entire game. All you know is that you’re a baby chick, and that weird, evil-looking oil has suddenly started spewing up from the ground, which for some reason means you need to collect golden artifacts and activate a series of statues to make things right. The simple-yet-adorable story is more than sufficient, and while the lack of guidance could theoretically have resulted in a muddled, hard-to-follow experience, the absence of hand-holding is instead remarkably refreshing. It allows for a true sense of discovery, creating a world where it’s up to the player to use their imagination and explore in order to figure out how everything works and how to progress. That said, there are certainly times when some text would have been appreciated – especially considering the game’s design and incredibly slow pace will undoubtedly appeal to a younger audience. The user interface is simply not as clear as it probably should be for a game relying solely on players' intuition to figure things out. As a whole, though, the gamble of withholding the written word paid off, and is a unique feature that definitely sets Toki Tori 2 apart from the puzzle pack. It works because the actual gameplay is quite simple. All you do is move left and right, scuttle up and down ladders, and press one button to stomp and another to whistle. All puzzles are built around these mechanics, requiring Toki Tori (the titular baby chick), to use some combination of them to interact with the creatures around him. Stomp to make a bug fall near a frog, and the frog will eat it and burp a bubble, which you can then travel in. Whistle to jump back to your last checkpoint – assuming you’ve figured out the special melody required to do so. Stomp to scare a lightning bug towards a dungeon-dwelling mask to make it shrivel onto the ground so you can pass. For how little you can actually *do* in this game, it’s astounding how many different ways you can manipulate your surroundings. One downside to these intentionally limited controls is that puzzle solutions are easy to come across accidentally. If you’re stuck, you can often just stomp or whistle around for a bit until the solution just sort of… happens. This doesn’t mean you won’t find yourself challenged – especially in later levels, Toki Tori 2 finds a satisfying difficulty level that should keep you on your toes. But it does mean it sometimes feels like you just happened upon the solution through random experimenting rather than your own cleverness. Cuteness... overload... The world, separated into dozens of levels to work your way through, is quite vast and a true joy to explore. The graphics are absolutely stunning, bringing this bright and beautiful world to life either on your television screen or when playing offscreen on the Wii U GamePad. From vibrant meadows to dark and gloomy caves to stunning vistas cast in silhouette (a la Donkey Kong Country Returns), it’s an absolute visual treat. Everything in the world is technically solvable from the outset, lending a cool “Metroidvania” vibe to the whole affair. Unlike the Game Boy Color original (or most Metroidvania-style games), there are no items or upgrades to acquire, rather it’s a gradual acquisition of knowledge and understanding that aids you in your backtracking endeavors. There may be a collectible you’ve been eyeing in one of the earlier levels, but it’s not until much later that it suddenly clicks how to access it. Toki Tori 2 is full of these satisfying “Aha!” moments, which are the crux of any puzzle game worth its salt. Toki Tori 2’s incredibly slow pace and lack of any true action make it an experience that is definitely not for everyone - but kids, puzzle lovers, and fans of all things adorable are in for a truly delightful and well-crafted experience. While simple, it controls beautifully, and the sense of exploration is absolutely incredible. If you’re ready to settle in for a leisurely stroll in a gorgeous and puzzling world, this charming download is a fine investment.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/26/need-for-speed-most-wanted-u-review	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of Need for Speed: Most Wanted, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review.   Two years ago acclaimed British developer Criterion took a stab at one of Need for Speed’s most established imprints: Hot Pursuit. The results were fantastic; it was a game that pushed the arcade racer forward in new, exciting  directions, providing unprecedented levels of connectivity, and was a major shot in the arm for the series. Thankfully, following on from the disappointment of last year’s entry The Run, Criterion is back in the driving seat, turning its perfectionist’s gaze towards another title from the franchise’s past. This time it’s Most Wanted receiving the makeover and the results occasionally approach the sublime. The first thing that impresses you about Most Wanted - and there are many highlights to choose from - is the sheer quality and craftsmanship of the game. It’s evident in most aspects of the game. It’s been constructed with a fastidious attention to detail. You’ll emerge from winding tunnels into blinding light; flecks of dirt and blades of grass will cling to the screen should you choose to go off-road; the music quality will dip and static will accumulate on your Sat Nav when you venture underground; the warm sunlight skims off rainwater that has pooled on the uneven, cracked tarmac. They’re all little touches – testament to time and energy – but when they all combine, as they frequently do, the result approaches something quite sublime. And you’ll still be able to appreciate it all tearing down the highway at 150 miles per hour. You get the impression that Criterion is rather proud of its achievement. Each race is prefaced by an introductory video, which showcases the city it has built from the ground up. Some are surreal vignettes in which police cars fall from the sky or perch on the ceiling of car parks like flies; others are snapshots of the city itself, showcasing its urban beauty. Things in the distance don’t bear up to the same scrutiny but it’s a more than acceptable tradeoff, since every side of Fairhaven – every sewer and flood drain, bridge and road – is accessible to you right from the beginning, without a single intrusive loading time. This is open-world gaming at it’s most seamless. Different sections aren’t crudely welded together with lengthy loading times. You’ll only be pulled out of it when you change cars, enter a race or switch to multiplayer and it never takes more than a few seconds.  But this is a driving game of course, so inevitably it comes down to the cars. And in keeping with its sandbox aspirations, you're able to drive nearly every one of its 41 vehicles right from the start, from the mundane Lancia Delta to the most desirable Aston Martin V12 Vantage. To drive them you don’t have to win races or accumulate points or buy tokens; you just have to find them. Some are hidden on rooftops or down back alleys; some are hiding in plain sight. When you find a new car it’s equipped with stock components: basic tyres, a basic chassis and transmission, and no nitrous exhaust. You upgrade your car by accumulating Speed Points, which you earn by transgressing the law, setting off speed cameras, bursting through billboards, evading the police. But the fastest way to net some serious Speed Points is by entering street races. Each car has five races open to it, ranging from easy to hard. The races themselves are fairly varied: there are straightforward circuit races, sprint races and Speed Runs, in which you’ll have to maintain an absurdly-fast average time while weaving in and out of traffic. Place well in the races and you’ll receive perks such as off-road tyres, a reinforced chassis (so you can burst through roadblocks), or different gear sets, depending on whether you want a higher top speed or faster acceleration. Modding is easily done via Easy Drive, the game’s persistent on-screen menu. It lets you upgrade your car using the D-pad, change your car and set a route to new race. It again furthers that open-world feel. Criterion is smart enough to know that nothing is more antithetical to the open-world experience that it’s trying to create than drilling down through a series of static menus. In addition to straightforward races, there are also Ambush events in which you’ll have to evade the boys in blue. Part of the fun of Most Wanted is antagonising the authorities. Initially you’ll feel restricted to the roads and highways of Fairhaven, but the races show you different sides to the city. There are two ways in which you can lose the fuzz: keep on running for the horizon and hope they can’t chase you or break the line of sight and hide under a bridge, like Ryan Gosling in Drive. But police interference isn’t limited to Ambush events. They’ll get involved in most races, attempting to ram you off the road or into oncoming traffic; dropping stingers right in front of you; or blocking entire intersections. As your ‘Heat’ level increases they’ll employ faster cars to chase you down and even call in SWAT teams. And this is where your mods can give you a slight advantage – if you need to plough through parked SWAT vans or SUVs you must equip a reinforced chassis and the powershot exhaust, otherwise your car will crumple on impact. However, modding on the move isn’t all that easy and the risk of crashing into an obstacle while trying to change to re-inflatable tyres isn’t really worth it. And while Kinect allows you to access Easy Drive more easily, during the fast-paced races of Most Wanted it’s still a bit of liability to mod mid-race. The spectacular is well within reach of even the novice in Most Wanted. Cars handle brilliantly. Once you master drifting and how to use nitrous bursts effectively, you’ll be competitive in most races. Harder races aren’t intimidating with practice and a range of mods unlocked. Slow and steady won’t win you races in Most Wanted; only insanely fast and audacious will.  Races in Most Wanted begin not from a static racing line, with you patiently waiting to hit the gas, but from a rolling start – you’re furiously thrown into the middle of the race and that’s pretty much emblematic for the game itself. The opening credits end with an invitation – a robotic-sounding woman’s voice says, “What happens next is up to you.” And that’s part of the game’s central weakness. It provides so much freedom that some will find it rather aimless. When you can drive and upgrade a Lamborghini Gallardo right from the beginning, the motivation to do it all again with a hatchback quickly evaporates. Some many of its pleasures are immediate, not rationed nor deferred. Saying that, there is a very loose narrative of sorts: you’re tasked with becoming the city’s most notorious racer. When you earn sufficient Speed Points you’ll be able to challenge one of Fairhaven’s ten most wanted racers. They drive the most desirable cars in the game – from the real-world Bugatti Veyron to fantastical concept cars – and the races are akin to boss fights, periodically testing your skills and knowledge of the city’s streets. (Incidentally, each race is preceded by the most stunning introduction.) Beat them by successfully take down their vehicle and you’ll take their car as a prize. It’s the main incentive to keep on racking up those Speed Points. That incentive is bolstered by the game’s approach to multiplayer. You’ll be able to drive around a private version of the city with friends, smashing into each other with Ballardian glee, or run through ‘setlists’, which comprise of races as well as challenges – who can make the biggest jump or execute the longest drift, and so on. It’s a lot fun and, as with the main game, it’s all seamless and flowing. Events are linked by mini-races as players attempt to get to the starting point before the rest. But if multiplayer isn’t your sort of thing Criterion has subtly woven competition into the very fabric of Fairhaven. Billboards will carry the face of your friend who burst through it at a higher speed, for instance. It’s subtle but very effective. The Wii U version of Most Wanted is a very faithful port of the original. So if you want to tear around Fairhaven, becoming the city’s most notorious street racer, this version is as good a place to do it as any. Criterion's touted that they’ve been able to bring to the PC version’s enhanced textures to the Wii U, (thanks to the available 1GB of RAM compared to the 512MB available to Xbox 360 and PS3). The truth is I was hard-pressed to notice the difference from the existing console versions. It looks great, but isn’t a noticeable step up. Likewise, it's unimpressive that Most Wanted U includes the first piece of DLC – the Ultimate Speed Pack – as part of the package. Despite the exciting title, it’s a superficial expansion at best. It adds five extra cars, 25 new challenges, and 70 more milestones. The real extra content that distinguishes this version from its peers comes from the integration of the Wii U’s GamePad. It’s used in a variety of ways, some of which work better than others. The ability to use the gyroscope to steer cars, for example, is really more of a disadvantage in such a high-speed racer. It’s just too crude and imprecise to be much fun. Far more curious is the Co-Driver mode. Criterion has said it’s their attempt at giving Most Wanted a more ""Nintendo feel"" – they even refer to it as the ‘father and son’ mode. It’s a type of asymmetrical co-op: one player's in charge of driving the car, using either a Wiimote or Pro-Controller, while the second player mans the GamePad, granting them near god-like control over key aspects of the game. With a simple tap of the touchscreen, the second player can take control of car away from the other player or instantly turn day into night. The GamePad also shows a more expansive, detailed map, allowing them to direct the driver toward places of interest, such as jack spots or challenges. The GamePad is much more powerful than that – it can also remove other vehicles from the roads and even make police cars spin wildly out of control. Another tap can fix badly-damaged cars, removing the satisfying challenge of finding a garage in the middle of an intense race and trying to thread your car through it at 90mph.  Despite the magnitude of these powers, the second player’s role is really little more than that of an overseer. They can choose to be benevolent, increasing road visibility and removing oncoming traffic, but such is their lack of real involvement, it’s far more likely they’ll use these powers for mischief. It’s worth stressing, however, that this extra functionality is optional, not obligatory. Players who want to enjoy Need for Speed: Most Wanted in its original form can do so on Wii U, but having what is effectively a cheat mode so close at hand might prove too irresistible for some. Considering the extent to which GamePad has been utilised, it’s all the more puzzling that the Easydrive menu – how you select challenges and mod your car on the move – doesn’t take advantage of the hardware. The D-Pad is still used to cycle through various submenus. It’s a real shame since this interface – which has to be used so frequently – could have really benefitted from the use of a touchscreen. While these new additions may have imbalanced Most Wanted U in some respects, they’ve also created a sandbox of greater possibilities and accessibility. One of the recurrent criticisms Most Wanted received on its initial release was its lack of structure – nearly all of its delights are there to be enjoyed right away. I found myself driving around for hours, achieving very little. It was frantic and desultory, but it didn’t really matter since the abiding experience was so much fun. Most Wanted U is perhaps the most capable version of that sandbox, giving players more control of the environment and objects within it, but in the process it may have removed some of the challenge that also kept you coming back to the streets of Fairhaven. As with all sandbox games the narrative is of your own making but this is even more true of Most Wanted. The side-effect is that it can feel aimless at times. If you desire structure, if you wanted a game to be meted out to you, you might find its instant freedom somewhat overwhelming. But Most Wanted is all about deviation and deviance. It’s the racing game for people who don’t tend to like racing games. You’re not punished for missing that apex or abandoning that nagging racing line. It’s undoubtedly one of the year’s most exhilarating experiences."
Greg Miller	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/21/the-walking-dead-survival-instinct-review	" While games such as Batman: Arkham Asylum and Arkham City stand as shining examples of how you can take a known franchise and lovingly make it into an awesome game, more often than not, licensed titles end up disappointing fans. That’s what The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct does; it gives licensed games a bad name. It’s a damn shame, too. On paper, this concept is what I, as a fan of the AMC TV show, would love to see in a game. Acting as a prequel to the show, Survival Instinct tells the story of motorcycle-riding redneck Daryl Dixon from the moment the outbreak shambles into his life. Sweetening the pot, TV Daryl himself – actor Norman Reedus – shares his likeness and voice with his in-game counterpart, and his performance is actually spot-on. The same can be said for Michael Rooker, who reprises his role as Daryl’s (annoying) brother. But that’s pretty much where The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct stops getting things right – or at least doing anything noteworthy. From here on out, it’s boilerplate first-person shooter mechanics paired with dated visuals and cool ideas that never develop into cool experiences. You’ll get shotguns, pistols, and naturally that famed crossbow, but Survival Instinct doesn’t want you to run and gun. You’re supposed to sneak up on walkers and stealth-kill them with your knife, throw bottles to distract the horde while you slip by, and stick to cover. The only problem is it does a bad job of giving us any reason to play by those rules. I played the first few missions this way, but eventually the flawed game design shone through. Rather than sneak past walkers on my way to an objective, I found I could ignore them and just sprint there. Sure, I’d have to deal with the last few walkers that saw me, but the first group would lose interest and give up the chase. Then, I'd climb on a car, woodpile, or other waist-high obstacle, wait for the second group swarm me, and simply stab them in the head one by one while shaking my head in disbelief at their inability to simply reach out and snatch me. Another great idea that falls apart in practice is Survival Instinct’s take on resource management. There’s no real story here beyond just moving from place to place in hope of the eventual rescue we all know won't come, but you do get to choose where you’re going and how you get there. That may sound like it could be a cool form of exploration, but let me spoil that for you: every level is pretty much as angular and bland as the last. Knowing this, as I wish I had up front, nips that curiosity in the bud pretty quick. It's one of those ""choices"" that simply doesn't matter. How you’re getting there boils down to one of three methods (ranging from back roads to highways) and each comes with unique pros and cons. Back roads give you more opportunities to scavenge, but they burn a lot of gas; highways burn little fuel, but they’re more prone to lead to a breakdown. Again, this sounds awesome – there's the danger of having to scour levels for gas cans while walkers wait around every corner if you're reckless – but The Walking Dead mucks it up. If you break down on the open road, you’re dropped into one of a handful of tiny levels with a magic compass that points you straight to the car part you need. If you run out of gas, it’s back to one of the handful of pitstop levels to sprint around collecting the randomly placed gas cans. It swiftly goes from a solid concept to feeling like developer Terminal Reality included it just to pad the total game time, which only took me five and a half hours. When you run into other survivors in your travels, you’ll get optional missions to complete and occasionally a new group member. Before you head out to the mission at hand, you can equip the members of the group with weapons and items you’ve procured and send them out to farm fuel, ammo and so on. Know where this is going? It’s a fun idea – one Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker nailed – but it doesn’t work here. The survivors have no personality, no soul. I don’t care about them, so who cares if they die? If I run out of fuel, the game starts me in the aforementioned pit stops. These characters don’t matter – and it would appear the game agrees as the people don’t even get a line of dialogue if you kick them out of the group and basically sentence them to death by zombie. This is just a boring inventory system, and it could’ve been so much more. And that’s the long and short of The Walking Dead: Survival Instinct – it could’ve been so much more. It has the actors from the show, it’s tied into a cool universe, and it mashes up Oregon Trail elements with a thinking man’s FPS. It just doesn’t do anything with this stuff. It’s a half-baked attempt at a game that can be fun in the occasional spooky part, but ends up under-delivering in every way."
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	 Every time a new Monster Hunter games comes out, I think: surely, I must be done with this now. After several hundred hours over at least three versions, I’m not going to get sucked in again. But I do, every time. It's because Monster Hunter’s world is so absorbing, and the gentle rhythm of prepare, hunt, and collect is so innately satisfying. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is the slickest game in the series to date, and it’s an ideal introduction to the hugely enjoyable business of cooperative monster-slaying. The basic idea is to venture out into the wilds, find an impressive monster, kill it, and then make hats and swords out of its entrails – but there’s a lot more to it than that. There are 12 weapons, hundreds of items, and more than 100 hours’ worth of quests, but it’s the thrill of the chase and the addictive rush of hard-earned victory that continually hooks me in. Monster Hunter has a reputation for being intimidating, but really it’s a lot easier to get to grips with than it looks. It’s challenging, sure – thrillingly challenging – but it’s hardly Dark Souls. In Japan this is a game played by mums, little brothers, couples… something like five million people, going by Monster Hunter Portable 3rd’s sales. All you need is someone to show you the ropes.  There are a few new monsters, a rearranged single-player experience and a whole new multiplayer area, but the meat and bones are the same as 2010’s Monster Hunter Tri – with updated graphics on Wii U, of course, and much better loading times. It’s got the same finely-tuned selection of weapons, the same storyline, and many of the same single-player quests, though they have been reshuffled to incorporate new monsters and the difficulty curve is slightly gentler this time around - some of the toughest missions have been moved up a rank or two, evening out a few of Tri’s difficulty spikes. Whether you’re playing on 3DS or Wii U, you’re getting the same experience, which is pretty remarkable in itself. You can transfer your save between the two platforms using a free app from the eShop. You can play online on Wii U, but not on 3DS – and if there’s four of you in a room together, you can play locally on three handheld consoles and one Wii U, and the TV screen becomes an HD showcase for your battle - which is by far the most exciting way to play. Monster Hunter really comes alive in multiplayer, so you’ll want to coerce some friends into playing with you. Show them a few of the best battles, though, and they probably won’t need much persuasion. The graphical update is a touch disappointing for players of Tri, though. It’s clear that Capcom has spent most of its time making the monsters themselves look better; the environments, by contrast, are still very sparse, with some textures that are noticeably out of place in HD. The smaller monsters and non-player characters in the single- and multiplayer towns also haven’t been remodelled. Touchscreen features, though, are a valuable addition. The Wii U gamepad and 3DS touchscreen can be customised with panels, so you can put your map, health and stamina, item pouch, and whatever else on the bottom screen if you want, giving you an unobstructed view of the action. It unclutters the screen, it’s customisable to your tastes, and it’s more convenient to actually play. Monster Hunter quests come in three broad flavours: head out and gather some of this thing, kill a number of smaller monsters, or kill one big bad monster. The third flavour makes up about 75% of the quests on offer, and those are the ones that progress you through the ranks; Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate knows we don’t want to spend hours collecting mushrooms before we’re allowed to fight anything.  That said, crafting is integral to Monster Hunter, and gathering materials out in the wilds to make the tools you need provides the slower-paced, more soothing counterpoint to the lengthy battles. You need ore and metals for armour, herbs for making potions, plants and animal parts to combine into useful things like performance-enhancers and, of course, weapons and armour. There are only six large areas, from desert to volcano to beautiful mountain to the obligatory frozen tundra, and one new area that looks like a mystical Chinese jungle. Almost all of the quests take place in these same six areas (excepting a few that have their own special arenas); it might seem stingy, but it forces you get to know them intimately, mentally mapping every shortcut and resource point. It’s all preparation for the main event. Monster Hunter’s battles are among those rare video game confrontations that truly qualify as epic: they last up to 50 minutes, and at their most gut-wrenching they are battles of attrition that go right down to the wire, as you launch your lance into the air with your last sliver of stamina just as a monster opens its jaws and miraculously kill it with seconds left on the clock. It’s these tremendously rewarding struggles that deliver the most powerful adrenaline surge, and if the first one works on you, you’ll be chasing that hit through the 200-odd quests in the game. Underpinning Monster Hunter’s grand battles is a lovably quirky sense of humour. It’s got eccentric gestures, ridiculous armour, talking cats that cook your dinner, pigs in Babygro onesies, a cheesy barbecuing mini-game, and wittily translated dialogue – and the sight of my hunter haplessly sprinting away from a monster before falling on her face still raises a smile 40 hours in. The best moments in Monster Hunter are when you meet a new beast for the first time. These creatures look incredible; aggressive, distinctive, and properly alive. They don’t have anything so obvious as a health bar – you have to ascertain how close you are to victory by observing their behaviour, watching for a limp, a damaged wing, or signs of tiredness. This is one of the best things about Monster Hunter – you have to rely on your instincts and get to know your quarry.  There's a lot to learn about here, too. Even 50-plus hours in you will be seeing new monsters – though you’ll also be seeing a lot of the same ones, or a subspecies of a different colour. If you want to make a full set of armour out of a monster you’ll have to hunt it a lot. It can start to feel like a grind; friends come in handy here to alleviate the repetition. Working together towards a common goal feels a lot less like grinding than hunting the same monster on your own to mine it for parts, and gives you more room to experiment with the different weapons. These different weapons are the key to Monster Hunter’s lasting appeal – whenever your hunting style is starting to feel stale, you can just craft yourself something new, and combat transforms. Playing with a greatsword feels almost like a different game than playing with a bowgun. Each of 3 Ultimate’s 12 weapons is easy to learn, but there are nuances to the combat system that reward those willing to dig deeper, and within a team the dynamic of each one changes. Ranged weapons can feel a little sterile playing on your own compared to the up-close thrill of a sword or switch-axe, but in a team the bowgunner’s role is more exciting. The single-player sees you trying to save a quaint little fishing town called Moga Village from mysterious monster-related earthquakes. It’s a place I already know and love from Tri, but if you’re new, this is where you’re taught how to hunt. It has a farm where you can enlist feline minions to grow useful items for you and a fishing fleet that can bring back treasure, whilst free-hunting in Moga Woods gains you resources that you can use to help the villagers out. Playing alone, you’re gifted a little companion called Cha-Cha who comes in very handy on quests, distracting monsters for you whilst you land big hits. As this is a game designed for multiplayer, his help is invaluable. In MH3 Ultimate, there’s a second companion called Shakalaka who unlocks towards the end of the single-player story, just in time to help you with the high-rank quests. There’s some cute competitive interplay between the two sidekicks, but essentially he’s extra monster bait; it’s not exactly a game-changing addition. When it’s time for real multiplayer, you head to Port Tanzia, where you can meet up with friends. Local multiplayer is easy to set up, but the online interface on Wii U is unfortunately still as archaic as it was in Tri; one connection error and you’ll be booted aaaaall the way back to the start screen. Once you’ve managed to connect to a lobby, though, it rarely stumbled in my experience. The player population will obviously ramp up post-release (and in April, a patch is coming that will let American and European friends play on the same servers), but it’s difficult to imagine that the servers will be slammed.  Monster Hunter has often been a series where you have to work around its quirks, whether it was the absurd claw-like hand position needed to operate the camera on the PSP versions or the inconvenient lack of online multiplayer. With 3 Ultimate, a lot of these frustrations are gone; both versions control well. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate wasn’t made for the Wii U controller and it does feel a little awkward at first, but it never gets in the way of enjoying the game. On 3DS, even without the Circle Pad Pro attachment, controlling the camera using the touchscreen works surprisingly well. It’s not quite perfect, but it’s certainly a lot better than it ever was on the PSP; it’s only noticeably slow when you’re fighting underwater. Target Camera, meanwhile, lets you focus the camera on large monsters, which is a godsend for newer players. Monster Hunter 3 Ultimate is a good update of a great game that is starting to show its age, but it’s still very much worth your time and money. The monsters are stunning, the fights can be incomparably exhilarating, and the 3DS and Wii U connectivity is really impressive – even if the online infrastructure is still rather archaic. There’s just enough new stuff for Monster Hunter addicts to get into, and if you’ve never dived into this complex and rewarding series, this is the best opportunity yet.
Richard George	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/14/lego-city-undercover-review	 LEGO City Undercover faces a burden unlike any previous LEGO game developed by Traveller’s Tales. Not only is this production the first LEGO game by Traveller’s Tales to not feature a major movie or comic book license, it’s the first major Wii U game of 2013 – and the biggest release to come since that system’s launch four months ago. Nintendo fans will not just be looking for a great LEGO game. They’ll be looking for Undercover to deliver a complete and lasting experience that will help end a languishing software drought. In many respects, LEGO City Undercover delivers upon that potential. This is by far the largest LEGO game Traveller’s Tales has produced. Yet, at the same time, it’s held back by a variety of issues, including the fact that its core gameplay doesn’t have much depth. Undercover’s cleverly clichéd story begins with a quick-witted cop, Chase McCain, returning to his home of LEGO City after an extended absence, tasked with investigating the escape of his arch nemesis, Rex Fury. Ten hours later, the plot more resembles something out of a James Bond film, and the journey to that point is skillfully handled. There’s a strong sense of progression throughout the game, both in terms of the actual plot, as well as a steady unveiling of new missions and quirky costumes and abilities for McCain himself.  Much of Undercover’s entertainment stems from its cast of characters and tongue-in-cheek humor. Similar to the storyline, there’s a strong balance between slapstick humor and the (marginally) more serious police drama. All of the beats are familiar, as they rely heavily on borrowing from pop culture (Starsky and Hutch, Goodfellas, Batman and plenty more). But LEGO City Undercover begs forgiveness in its rampant reliance on old and used ideas because it plays everything up as a colorful, whimsical tribute – and parody. Chase McCain is basically a goofy amalgamation of every determined, noble cop ever – a little bit of Axel Foley and John McClane – mixed with the lovable cheese of characters like Troy McClure and even a bit of Ron Burgundy. Rex Fury is the overly aggressive, muscular bad guy that can’t think his way out of a paper bag – see every action movie ever. Because Undercover never takes itself too seriously, these references somehow don’t feel all that stale. In fact, picking them out is half the fun, even though some references are painfully obvious. There are definitely a few instances where tired references (Titanic) or obnoxious characters (Frank Honey) will prove excessive, though it’s clear Traveller’s Tales is attempting to serve kids and adults alike. If you’ve played any LEGO game ever, you’ll immediately understand the fundamental approach taken here – which is perhaps the game’s biggest blessing and curse. Undercover’s excellent open world serves mostly as a backdrop to over a dozen individual missions that exist in separate, more focused environments. Within these contained areas, your goal is simple: to break, build and navigate environments and puzzles (which are significantly more logical than past LEGO games) in pursuit of a particular person or object. Like its predecessors, Undercover also layers in secrets and areas that are only accessible by certain personas and their related abilities, which entices players to return repeatedly as they obtain upgrades. The sheer number of items to collect, and relative ease with which you collect them, helps override the somewhat generic nature of the gameplay itself, which lacks diversity or complexity. Whether you’re a thief, farmer or firefighter, you’re basically doing the same thing. And while combat looks good, you’re basically pressing the same button over and over, and don’t have to think about what you’re doing.  In some ways, LEGO City’s post-game experience is better than its main storyline, which is a respectable accomplishment, as the campaign is very good. Finding every secret and tracking down every collectible requires considerable effort and time, and that pursuit comes with a great deal of freedom. The wide world of LEGO City is a vast, sprawling affair, with over 20 distinct districts, including areas inspired by San Francisco, New York City, the United States capitol and more. You can acquire what you want, when you want (provided you have all of your abilities), and the scope of the city allows a diversity of environments necessary to avoid staleness. Above all else, Traveller’s Tales has placed various collectibles and activities cleverly, meaning that exploration is amply rewarded. All told, the number of items to acquire ranks in the hundreds, and there are plenty of ways to move about the world, from quick-travel points to cars, helicopters, boats and… even wheelchairs. As a Wii U exclusive, LEGO City Undercover is poised to bring with it unique control elements through the GamePad. Undercover does a reasonable job of this, through on-screen maps, Arkham Asylum-esque scanning abilities and taking in-game pictures. Most of this functionality ultimately doesn’t feel too critical to core gameplay however, and while some of it is creative, none of it changes the way the franchise would operate going forward.  A few other problems work against LEGO City Undercover. Loading times are not only too frequent but too long. It is not uncommon to endure several half-minute or minute loading screens within a very short timeframe. And nothing to mask this, whether through pre-loading or basically anything other than a horrifically dull white progression bar on the GamePad. Undercover isn’t exactly pushing cutting edge graphics, in fact it suffers from a somewhat inconsistent framerate, so the presence of this recurring issue is more than bothersome. LEGO City Undercover also omits any sort of cooperative experience, something that had very much been emphasized by past LEGO games. Though the story doesn’t exactly lend itself to a co-op setting, this franchise is essentially built around engaging families and couples. The omission of that option here is discouraging, and could be a deal-breaker for many. The fact that Undercover lacks any sort of off-TV play option is also a significant issue. LEGO City Undercover is the best iteration of a very familiar experience, which is as reassuring or problematic as that might seem. The sheer scope of the overworld is impressive, as is the way Traveller’s Tales layered in its wide range of collectible goodies, which ensures hours upon hours of activity after the campaign ends, which should take the average player about 10 hours, accounting for some collectible fetching. Undercover’s story is an incredibly entertaining homage to countless movies and television shows, and manages to feature a very strong cast of characters – no small feat considering the game has no major license associated with it. Of course, rampant loading times, no co-op and a variety of other problems (loading times, routine gameplay) hold Undercover back from truly taking the next step for the larger LEGO franchise.
Taylor Cocke	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/25/bittrip-presents-runner-2-future-legend-review	 When I was 12, I got my first guitar. At first, my parents didn't want to pay for lessons for fear that, like my piano playing, it wouldn't stick. So I sat in my room, headphones on, and attempted to teach myself Ramones, Green Day, and Beatles songs. The first time I managed to teach myself to play Blitzkrieg Bop, I knew I was on to something special. More than a decade later, I felt the same spark, the same love, while learning to play BIT.TRIP Presents Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien. When I say I was “learning to play” Runner 2, I don't mean it's inaccessible. Whether hero Commander Video is jumping over, sliding under, kicking through, deflecting, spinning around, or diving through whatever obstacles he runs into, it's all done with a press of a button or a flick of the stick. Just like simple guitar tunes designed to teach you open major chords or scales, early levels in Runner 2 focus on one or two skills, laying the groundwork for what's to come. The scariest traffic cop ever. And with each successful skill learned and impediment crossed, you're rewarded. Nail a jump, and a note is added to the Petrified Productions (and occasionally featuring the brilliant Disasterpeace), soundtrack. Collect all the gold bars and plus signs and the music rises to a crescendo. You can choose to not grab any of the goodies, but why would you deprive yourself of “playing” such excellent tunes? Eventually, levels throw every move possible at you at rapid speed, filling the background music with the notes of success. Failure throws you back to the beginning of the level or to a checkpoint, only to try again and again. It feels just like learning a particularly difficult guitar solo. With enough attempts, muscle memory kicks in, and those notes come flying in. There's no beating around the bush; this is practice. But with practice comes a payoff, and Runner 2's music is more than generous with the handouts. Those that don't like repetition could be annoyed, however. Never have green cubes looked so good. If you played the first BIT.TRIP Runner (or any of the other BIT.TRIP games, for that matter), Runner 2 may look a bit different than you're expecting. The first game featured pixelated characters with 3D backgrounds, whereas here we've got a fully 3D world. What's more, the sequel delivers fully narrated cutscenes, featuring the ever-charming Charles Martinet (you may know him better as the voice of Mario). Cheeky little advertisements for fake products like Mouth Burgers on the start screen also elicit smiles. Perhaps the developers just wanted to get Martinet to say funny things, but whatever the case, I was clearly amused Each of the five worlds has its own distinct look, bringing us from a crazy forest called The Supernature to the docks of the Emerald Brine to the Mounting Sadds, a continent seemingly comprised of nothing but factories and lava. You'll spend most of your time staring at the obstacles ahead, trying desperately not to die, but there's some genuinely charming and funny stuff going on in the background. 8-bit missions are secret unlockables. Look for a bunch of optional paths, too, some leading to much more difficult sections of the levels. Often, they came accompanied with new costumes or entrances to secret areas, but the very idea of challenging myself to pull of some complex maneuvers was enough to draw me down those darker paths. I wanted to push myself further. I needed to learn each and every intricacy of Runner 2's world. And that individual challenge made it a very personal experience. Of course, a dash of love for music and memories of my first guitar didn't hurt, either. Occasionally, I found myself in a bit of a trance. I saw the enemies and walls coming at me, only to be easily slid past as my fingers played in perfect time, my tapping toe keeping the beat of the song. I had gotten good enough to essentially sight-read levels. I felt comfortable throwing in the optional dance button for extra points. I was improvising. I had, in the few hours that I had been playing, learned a new instrument. It was hard, and required a fair amount of practice and perseverance, but being good was my reward. BIT.TRIP Presents Runner 2: Future Legend of Rhythm Alien is a music game that doesn't bother with instruments. You won't find any plastic guitars, drum sets, or even a turntable. You can't form a band, there's no audience, and you certainly won't be yelling at your buddies for screwing up the guitar solo. And yet, it's one of the finest music games ever made.
Neal Ronaghan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/02/22/puddle-wii-u-review-2	 Puddle, originally released on XBLA and PSN a year ago, makes a middling first impression. The first area of the game - centered around moving liquid left and right past obstacles - is boring, with the only exemplary detail being the vivid, beautiful graphics. At that point the game is reminiscent of NightSky, a 3DS/PC game that presents a series of mediocre-to-good physics-based puzzle rooms that tell no discernable story and are in no particular order. Puddle eventually triumphs past the lackluster start, though, bringing in a novel progression and interesting mechanics - but it takes way too long to get to there. At its base, the experience is very similar to Nintendo and Curve Studio’s Fluidity games, except the motion controls are optional. And terrible. You use the GamePad to tilt left and right, but it is extraordinarily imprecise and frustrating. Fortunately, the other two control methods - one using ZL and ZR and the other using an analog stick - are perfectly serviceable. This can&#Array;t end well... Camera limitations and lack of inputs make navigating levels bothersome, as the camera only focuses on the main fluid, ignoring any stragglers that you lose during the level. With no manual camera control, you’re doomed to guess where other liquid is. The controls have a nice simplicity to them, but when you use two buttons at most, and the camera is annoying, maybe some of the six or so additional inputs could have been used for a form of camera control. The first areas of the game aren’t terribly engaging, but after you get into the more creative liquids, such as rat goo and nitroglycerin, the game begins to open up and reveal some interesting mechanics. For example, nitroglycerin can explode if you’re not gentle with it, making for some hairy situations. Additionally, some interesting objectives appear, such as moving a beaker of liquid without spilling. You even carry acetylsalicylic acid (more commonly known as Aspirin) through the human body and dabble in zero-gravity situations. The visuals accentuate these novel areas, and one rocket fuel-based level even features an awesome graph-paper diagram background. The only bad thing about all these cool ideas is that they barely get expanded upon. For the most part, you get introduced to a new type of fluid, spend a minimal amount of time with it, and then move on. Puddle doesn’t linger too long on one substance, which keeps the game mildly fresh, but also makes the four-hour experience mildly schizophrenic. Challenges and online leaderboards add some replay value, but not that much. While Puddle debuted on other platforms last year, the Wii U version has quite a few enhancements, including 1080p graphics and a consistent 60 frames-per-second framerate. It also has well-implemented online leaderboards and a GamePad-only mode, which loses almost nothing on the smaller screen. In the burgeoning sub-genre of physics-based, liquid platformers, Puddle is a game that only hits a little more than it misses. The game has some neat ideas, but it never fully realizes them, only offering a taste of what could have been something more expansive and interesting. If you’re interested in the game and missed it on XBLA, PSN, Vita or PC, then you might be well off picking it up on Wii U. Puddle has its issues, but if you want something to play on Wii U, the system’s online store has what might be the definitive version of the game.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/22/the-cave-review	 First, I time-traveled into the distant future to the Museum of Natural History, where they’ve badly misinterpreted the events of our ancestors. These 2701 A.D. humans think keys were fashion accessories called “smurgs” that young people wore in their hair. Playing as the Time Traveler character, I visited the dinosaur exhibit, where I voluntarily got sprayed with “dinosaur scent.” “Now you smell like a stinky old dinosaur!” the speaker box claimed. I then hopped back in the time machine and warped to the prehistoric past, stinking like a…who knows what and approached a carnivorous dinosaur, who instantly wanted to mate. Fortunately, he (she?) couldn’t quite get to me because of the tight cave area he was in, so he just stood there, licking his chops, with a large ledge looming above. Next, I switched to the Hillbilly, another of my party’s three adventurers, and teleported to the past to join the Time Traveler. (Stick with me here. This is worth it, I promise.) I brought the Hillbilly to the ledge above the smitten dinosaur, where caveman Thog was busy trying to invent the wheel. All he had so far, though, was a square rock. I pushed the block off the ledge and onto the dinosaur’s head, killing it. Then, back in the present day, my third avatar, The Twins, went to the spot of the dino’s demise, bucket in hand, and scooped up some of the oil that the ancient carnivore’s corpse had turned into. Why the heck did I do all this? Because I needed the oil to fuel the museum’s working combustion engine that was powering the elevator – which I rode up to grab a wheel that I had to send back through time in order to distract Thog – the caveman ancestor of the Time Traveler’s archenemy in the future. Dropping another square wheel on his head killed him and thus eliminated his entire family line, completing future-dwelling Time Traveler’s jealousy-fueled quest to become the museum’s Greatest Employee of All Time. Got all that? What's a desert island doing in the middle of a cave? In The Cave’s twisted, dark, and often hilarious logic, puzzles take strange turns. It’s hardly a surprise given that Ron Gilbert – revered designer of such adventure classics as Monkey Island and Maniac Mansion – is behind this new puzzler. Nods to both are present (Monkey Island fans: look for the New Grog machine early in the game and see if The Hermit on the island reminds you of Herman Toothrot), but The Cave approaches its brain-benders not from a point-and-click interface but rather a side-scrolling platforming one. Like Gilbert’s past works, puzzles manage to finely walk the line between challenging and frustrating such that I felt smart when I solved them – a laudable design feat that’s no doubt much harder than it sounds. Sure, you’re likely to get stumped on occasion, but in my experience, taking a break and returning with a fresh mind later led to the solution in short order. Meanwhile, the side-scrolling platform gameplay mechanics fit the setting. The mysteries of The Cave – a sentient character that serves as the story’s narrator in this depth-plumbing tale of seven people’s dark sides – allow it to take you to such bizarre locations as a London mansion, a desert island, a carnival, and more. But as you switch back and forth between your characters to solve conundrums, you’ll have to do an endless amount of jumping to navigate the game world, and unfortunately the jumping controls are a bit wonky. It feels floaty on purpose, and the sensitivity is off enough that you’ll often fall or cling to a ledge and have to sit through a two-second animation every single time you miss making a clean jump. The Monk is one of seven characters in The Cave. You'll need to play the game three times to see everyone's story. Furthermore, the framerate suffers frequent, noticeable choppiness throughout the entire campaign – usually when the camera pans to a new area and has to load it in for the first time. It’s rather unexpected for a slow-paced adventure game, and while it’s not so bad that it will ruin your experience, it is a distraction. Intriguingly, The Cave offers seven playable characters, each with their own backstories and unique puzzle areas. And because you must lock-in three of them for each play-through, replayability is both built-in and encouraged. How many times you’ll want to do so, though, depends on how well you tolerate the game’s aforementioned annoyances. Up to three players -- one per character -- can play cooperatively on the same screen, but it's not of much use considering you're all bound to the same screen. No Toe Jam & Earl-style split-screen view pops up when you venture far enough apart from each other. Delightfully, The Cave is, in fact, a pure, puzzle-solving adventure game rife with funny lines and chuckle-inducing non sequiturs despite trying to disguise itself as a side-scrolling platformer. It doesn’t stay with you the way Gilbert’s classics did, however. You experience it, you enjoy it, but you’re not likely to catch yourself daydreaming about unforgettable sequences in The Cave the way you fondly recall Monkey 1’s insult sword-fighting or Monkey 2’s endlessly debatable ending. Maybe that’s because the story is mostly told through scattered comic-book-style panels or because the only real dialogue comes from The Cave itself and not the seven characters. But being a Ron Gilbert-built adventure game in the modern era, it’s wholly unique in the market and your game library will be a better place with it included.
Lucas M. Thomas	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/15/marvels-the-avengers-battle-for-earth-review	" When the Wii U debuted, several Nintendo fans – myself included – were excited that games like Assassin’s Creed III and Batman: Arkham City were among the launch lineup. It’s encouraging to think that titles like those, previously only produced for the PS3 and Xbox 360, would finally be available on a Nintendo console as well. Unfortunately, it seems that bridge built between the different hardware is a two-way street.  Marvel’s The Avengers: Battle for Earth on the Wii U is a port of a title first released on Kinect for Xbox 360. That means Nintendo fans are now getting a boomerang effect – Kinect was inspired by the first Wii’s motion controls, and now a title built for hands-free motion has bounced back to the company that’s trying to move on from their own motion era. The result is an odd, limited fighting game that offers two different ways to play – one that’s a bit more modern, embracing the GamePad, and another that feels just like the normal Wii fare we were getting five or six years ago. ""And stay down!"" The storyline draws inspiration from the Secret Invasion arc that ran through Marvel's many books back in 2008, so you take command of one of the Avengers – or an X-Man, or one of a few Marvel supervillains – and do battle with the evil Skrull versions of the same characters in head-to-head combat. With the Wii Remote and Nunchuk control scheme, this means waggling away at the screen to deliver projectiles and punches while following on-screen help icons to execute more complicated moves (like shoving your arms out in front of you or pointing the Remote straight up or down). It’s messy, and battles quickly devolve into random waggles and button presses. The GamePad experience is better, as it moves all input onto the handheld touchscreen and asks you to tap different icons to trigger your normal attacks, while super attacks involve tapping an icon and then following up by tracing a zig-zagging path on the screen with your finger. Dodging and swapping to your partner character are both also activated by on-screen virtual buttons, and it’s more fun to play this way than trying to wave your arms around with the Wiimote and nunchuk. But that’s all there is to Battle for Earth. The gameplay never gets any more complicated. Every fight is the same rhythm of tapping the same buttons to make the same moves. And the difficulty level of these battles is low, so you can frequently win simply by tap, tap, tapping your finger constantly on the different attack triggers and never letting your opponent get in any counters.  It’s limited. There are a few different gameplay modes, but each one is just a slight variation of the one before – there are challenges like trying to win a fight without using your super moves, or the co-op mode that pairs you with a friend (though one of you gets stuck with the Wii Remote control scheme). What’s worse, there’s no variation in the playable characters at all. Every hero – Thor, Hulk, Wolverine, Spider-Man and the rest – has the same standard distance attack, the same launching knee kick, the same array of three supermoves. The patterns you trace with your finger on the GamePad differ for each character, but beyond that their differences are purely cosmetic. Every character gets a projectile attack. (Hulk throws rocks.) If cosmetic differences are all you’re interested in, though, the game is happy to offer you some unlockable costumes for the cast – and charge you more money for others as DLC through the eShop. In the end, Marvel’s The Avengers: Battle for Earth is just too limited to recommend. It was originally meant to be a playful Kinect fighter for kids, and the youngest set of gamers may well be able to derive some enjoyment from the simple inputs and seeing their favorite superheroes beat the snot out of each other. But there’s just not enough content or variety here to justify the expense of a full retail purchase. The scope of this design suggests that this Battle should have been fought as something like a $10 iPad app instead."
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/14/007-legends-wii-u-review	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of 007 Legends, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review.   It really shouldn’t be this hard to make a decent James Bond game, should it? As far as source material goes, 50 years of 007’s big screen adventures should have provided the team at Eurocom with a wealth of blockbuster stunts, style and subterfuge to draw from. Unfortunately, it seems like the development team has merely skimmed the back covers of a few of the DVDs in the James Bond box set and then decided to interpret them in the form of a poor man’s Call of Duty. As far as tributes go, this is like raising your champagne flute to toast someone and then using it to glass them in the eye. Here’s the setup for the single-player campaign: in a scene from the upcoming Skyfall, Daniel Craig’s 007 is accidentally shot by a female sniper whilst fending off an enemy on the roof of a moving train. Bond then plummets down into a river below, and while his lungs fill up with water he’s struck by a series of flashbacks to his previous adventures, each of which serve as the five different missions in the game. Those missions are taken (slightly out of chronological order) from Goldfinger, On Her Majesty’s Secret Service, License to Kill, Die Another Day and Moonraker, with a sixth mission based on Skyfall to be released later as free DLC. Each mission is set in the present day since it’s Daniel Craig’s Bond replacing the likes of Connery and Moore, but despite that justification it still feels a little odd to be breaking into Blofeld’s alpine lair and taking surveillance snaps with your smartphone, or watching one of Goldfinger’s henchmen fly out of the ejector seat in a modern Aston Martin DBS rather than the original DB5. In fact all of it just feels off. While there are some moments that are faithful to the source material – such as the cutscene in which Bond is strapped to a slab of gold and sweating on Goldfinger’s crotch-searing laser – for the most part 007 Legends is barely recognizable as a Bond experience, much less a tribute to the series’ proud history. It may as well be called Call of Duty: Bond Ops, it lifts so much from Activision’s flagship shooter series. You can practically see Eurocom ticking off its development checklist as you go: mounted mini-gun sequence? Check. Slow-motion door breach? Check. Enemies that respawn infinitely until the player moves to a designated checkpoint? Checkity-check-check. The fact that it so shamelessly copies from the CoD playbook would be almost forgivable if it actually did a good job of it, but 007 Legends is just so painfully dull. None of its set pieces are at all memorable, and each mission is more or less structured in the exact same way – with Bond machine-gunning everyone to death on his way into a villain's base, before taking some photos and scanning fingerprints in their office, and then machine-gunning everyone to death on his way out again. It's not gung ho; it's ho hum. The Fort Knox level from Goldfinger now looks like a D-Day landing. If you choose to play it in a stealthier manner then you're in for an even worse time. For a game that seems hell bent on giving a modern makeover to some of Bond’s former exploits, it comes as quite a shock that its stealth mechanics are so archaic. Bond moves silently when crouched so you can sneak up behind enemies and knock them out or shoot them with a silenced weapon. However, the fact that you can’t move bodies or peek around corners coupled with the near useless line of sight indicators for guards means you rarely stay hidden for long, and once your cover is blown then you're rushed by every enemy in the vicinity and the firefights resume. The frustrations with the sneak mechanics are further exacerbated by the mandatory stealth sections of the game, which hit you with an instant 'mission fail' screen if you're spotted. Seriously, if stealth is your bag then go and pick up Dishonored. To be fair, the developer has made some attempts to alleviate the monotony that sets in with the repetitive shooting and the frustration inherent to the stealth system. 007 Legends also features some overly simplistic hacking mini-games, along with some poorly controlled driving missions and some hilarious boss fights that all play out like a cross between a sluggish quicktime event and a game of Punch Out!! Sadly, beating Blofeld doesn&#Array;t allow you fight Disco Kid or Mike Tyson. 007 Legends' only redeeming feature is its multiplayer. While the online game may have had its player count cut down to 12 from the 16 supported in GoldenEye: Reloaded, it's the four-player split-screen mode that stands out simply because same-screen multiplayer has become such a rarity in the FPS genre. Which is some good news for the group of gamers out there that prefer to playfully trash talk their mates on the couch beside them rather than scream obscenities at strangers through a USB headset, although if you already own GoldenEye: Reloaded then you're not missing much by avoiding 007 Legends. 007 Legends doesn't even sound like a good idea on paper, and it's presented in such a half-hearted manner. Why force Daniel Craig's likeness into each of the five previous generations of Bond, if you're not even going to bother to get his voice? (And his soundalike is atrocious.) Why include a driving level in the License to Kill mission if you're not going to let the player do that awesome stunt where Timothy Dalton's Bond balanced a Kenworth truck on its side in order to dodge an RPG round? Why feature the character of Jinx from Die Another Day if you're not going to feature Halle Berry's voice or likeness? Why include Moonraker at all? It's almost like the developer has gone out of its way to actively disappoint fans, and if this game isn't for them then who exactly is it for? Remember the invisible car that Bond drove in Die Another Day? Eurocom doesn&#Array;t. Lastly, it should be pointed out that the Skyfall mission DLC isn’t some optional extra, it’s actually the end of the campaign. Otherwise, you play through the five missions on the disc and once you finish Moonraker it abruptly transitions straight into the credits. We can only assume that the Skyfall mission has been held off so as not to spoil the new movie. But they’ve already spoilt five old movies by including them on the disc, so why stop there? Tough though it may be to imagine 007 Legends getting any worse, its late-arriving port for the Wii U finds a few niggling ways to sour the experience further. I had hope for this one visually when I noticed that all the irritating screen tearing from the 360 version was absent, but those hopes were soundly dashed once the bullets started flying. Despite the system's competent internals, and the game's low graphical fidelity, the frame rate is well shy of the other console versions, which on its own would be a disappointment. Sadly, that isn't the only problem here. The most crippling and puzzling issue is actually the aiming, which was perfectly fine when the game first shipped. This version employs a large dead zone, and moving the analog stick within this zone doesn't shift your reticule at all. It simply accelerates it clumsily once you move past the threshold, making it far harder to hit your target than it should be. What's more, the devs failed to make any interesting use of the gamepad, something you'd imagine to be a no brainer with a protagonist that loves gadgets so well. Finally, the online multiplayer has taken a turn for the worse, with shaky netcode and a baffling inability to create custom game sessions and invite friends. Needless to say, there isn't much reason to grab 007 Legends in the first place, but if you're a Bond diehard hellbent on owning it, you'll want to pass on the Wii U version, and hop the fence to the slightly greener pastures of Microsoft and Sony. Last year Eurocom delivered GoldenEye: Reloaded, an HD remake which was arguably the best James Bond game since well, the original GoldenEye 64. Unfortunately the developer hasn't been able to maintain that trajectory with 007 Legends; an abhorrent 'tribute' to the history of the British super spy that doesn't just take liberties - it takes the piss. At a time when early reports suggest the celluloid Bond is reaching a new high with Skyfall, it's a shame that his video game counterpart has reached his digital downfall. If you're really dying for a Call of Duty-style shooter experience, then sit tight as Black Ops II has likely got more money than God behind it and it's only a month away."
Ryan Clements	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/18/sing-party-review	" Karaoke serves a number of noble purposes in the grand workings of social interaction. It assists the uncertain. It celebrates the gifted. It forgives the inept. And when paired with a few choice beverages, it can fashion our favorite songs into doorways to good times and big laughs. Sing Party, a karaoke game for Nintendo's Wii U, succeeds at some of these endeavors. It makes excellent use of the Wii U GamePad and braves new multiscreen setups for party environments. But it also falters. And like an off-key high note, Sing Party's flawed tracklist and simple execution spoil an otherwise enjoyable karaoke performance.  There are predominantly two ways to play Sing Party. Each way employs the GamePad differently, but both are effective. In sing mode, the pad brims with features for the performer or the performer's friends to use. The playlist can be modified in real time while the singer continues uninterrupted. Instrument and vocal levels can be adjusted to bring out the best (or worst) in a performance. And a trivial, but amusing, jam feature provides an extra instrument (drums, guitar, bongos, piano) to play with. These features make great use of the GamePad screen space, pushing useful information and a handful of toys to the hands of non-performers. Party mode reverses this dynamic. The GamePad becomes a guide for the performer while the main screen is used by everyone else in the room -- ideally a full ""party,"" though a smattering of friends will also do. During a performance in party mode no scores are kept. Instead, the performer is free to face his or her friends and use the GamePad screen for lyrics. Meanwhile, key moments in the song pop on the main display so the rest of the party can join in on cue. They can also, if they feel the urge, groove along with the on-screen dancer for maximum party hijinks. This about sums it up. Party mode is much less a game and much more a karaoke experience designed to involve the rest of the crowd. It boasts immediate appeal, but with no means of tracking scores and no sense of progression outside of inconsequential award tokens, player investment vanishes at the end of the song. Sing mode addresses this issue, intentionally or otherwise, with a pitch meter and scoreboard that many karaoke games have employed in the past. But it feels shallow here. With its intelligent GamePad usage and sturdy basics, Sing Party does many things right. But not everything worked as well. Some problems can be begrudgingly brushed to the side, like the absence of official music videos during sing mode. Even the lack of character/costume variety in the on-screen dancer can be forgiven. But the tracklist stutters. And that's where a karaoke game must, under all circumstances, perform free of mishaps. At a glance, IGN Karaoke Superstar Greg Miller liked it. But out of the 50 songs on the disc, Greg could only find about 15 he wanted to sing. And far fewer actually got a rise out of him. Someone&#Array;s having an AWESOME time. Sure, megahits like ""Call Me Maybe"" and ""Party Rock Anthem"" represent the current pop landscape with total dominance, and ""Surfin' USA"" and ""Daydream Believer"" bring the proper old-school love. But most of the tracks are shrug-worthy at best. Sing Party includes one Queen song, but it's ""Don't Stop Me Now,"" not ""We Will Rock You."" Lionel Richie makes an appearance but it's not with ""Hello."" B.o.B. shows up with no sign of ""Nothin' on You."" It's as if all the A-list material wasn't available for Sing Party to use, so the music wranglers had to settle for B-sides in a last-ditch attempt at a complete tracklist. Considering the thousands of songs on karaoke machines and the hundreds of songs across the Rock Band series, a 50-song set filled with duds is inexcusable. And at the time of this review, no downloadable content exists for Sing Party -- just the hazy promise of additional content in early 2013. Having nothing to buy a month after launch doesn't exactly inspire confidence in the future of a game, especially one that could have proven itself as a long-running karaoke platform for the Wii U. The functional karaoke mechanics and effective GamePad integration make Sing Party a passable option for those gamers looking for a little musical accompaniment to their parties. But a weak tracklist festers underneath Sing Party's accessible, bland exterior. And without an adequate progression system to encourage repeat play, Sing Party misses its leap for gaming greatness."
Casey Lynch	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/14/tank-tank-tank-review	 Tank! Tank! Tank! is Earth Defense Force with tanks. TTT – as Tank! Tank! Tank! shall hereby be known in this review– is simple to understand: you shoot stuff with tanks. It’s generally fun with friends in short spurts, but spend some serious time with it and the weaknesses begin to appear. Clunky controls, a frustrating randomized weapon system, and endless repetition in gameplay and progression all prevent TTT from achieving any real level of long-lasting recommendable goodness.  TTT doesn’t have much in the way of story, other than its goofy premise that’s playfully fun – it’s basically every Japanese monster and mech disaster movie rolled into one. Not nearly as fleshed out as something like EDF or even Starship Troopers, it’s still interesting to see what creature(s) you’ll be fighting next. TTT’s story and multiplayer modes offer an array of timed missions, each one focusing on “kill the thing(s) dead” in X amount of time (usually under three minutes). Depending on how quickly you take the bad guys down, you earn medals. This is good and bad. Medals are the currency in TTT – you use them to unlock the game’s 36 missions and new tanks. It’s really satisfying to beat a mission with a good time and unlock a medal, until you realize you need like a bazillion of the things to really make any progress. To nab the necessary medals, you’ll need to replay levels with new tanks, level those new tanks up to then unlock more new levels, then go back and unlock new medals on old missions with the new tanks to earn more medals to unlock more new tanks to unlock… it just goes on and on. There’s one tank in the game that requires 420 medals to unlock. While my inner-adolescent lol’ed for a moment, it really just made me sigh. 420 friggin medals? No way, Jose. And while the quest for more medals incentivizes you to pay attention to the objectives of each stage to earn the best score (S, A, B, C, D, F), it becomes a grind almost immediately. This wouldn’t be incredibly objectionable if the gameplay was especially fun, but it’s just okay at best. TTT’s gameplay is straight-forward enough; you move and you shoot. This would be TOTALLY AWESOME if it worked the way I wanted it to, the way you’d want it to, the way it should. But it doesn’t, and that’s just a shame. Specifically, the controls are stilted and fusty. Some tanks are faster than others, some are heavier and have more armor, etc., etc., but they’re all broken and unresponsive. They’re mostly slow, or they don’t turn well, or when you brake the faster tanks, they slow down too much.  Just okay.  Also, one of the cool features on tanks is rotating turrets, right? That could conceivably introduce a twin stick steering and shooting mechanic that would enable you to drive one way and shoot another. I wanted to play like this. You’d want to play like this. But you can’t. All of this reduces the controls – and the gameplay— to lots of moving forward, and then moving backwards, all while shooting and shooting and shooting, over and over again. Your standard weapons don’t really do much, so you’ll rely on two levels of automatic weapon power-ups, yellow (light) and blue (heavy), that you must run over after they’ve ejected out of the monsters as they’re shot. So you’re locked in this dance with these creatures, shooting them with your ineffective weapon until they spawn better weapon power-ups for you. This fetching of power-ups can lead to steering and navigational frustration and quickly becomes one of the more troublesome elements of the game. The upgrades appear randomly, and if you accidentally drive over a yellow, it can override a blue, nullifying the more useful power-up.  This great undulation of moving forward and backward, shooting, trying to drive over power-ups, trying to beat the mission time, do the whole medal grinding thing – that is TTT. Entirely. So I say again, playing this at a friend’s house for a few matches with four players is fun. Anything more than that and it feels more like a set of chores to complete than a game. This is not a formula for lasting fun. Just ask my son, Ryan.  I’d rather play something else.  Ryan is eight years old and he would gladly choose to play video games over doing pretty much anything else. I had him play TTT with me to help with the review. Here he is after a few hours of playing Tank! Tank! Tank!. And again about after 10 hours. After around a dozen levels in, he just fizzled out and didn’t want to play anymore.This led to an interesting exchange between him and me, most notably his about his reaction to having to trudge on. “But I don’t want to play this anymore, it’s too much,” he groaned, rolling on the ground, exaggerating but getting his point across. He looked done. “This is what I do, this is how you review a game.” “I’d rather play something else.” “I think you just wrote the review.” And thus, you have TTT summed up by the target ‘kid and his parent’ Wii U demographic. Playing TTT as a Wii U launch title adds a bit of artificial excitement to the experience. This was one of the first games I played with my kids on Wii U, and they were really intrigued by the GamePad, especially when they realized they could turn the TV off and just play with the controller on the couch. That’s about as far as the Wii U implementation goes though, with the rest of the integration feeling serviceable but a bit bland. And by bland, I don’t mean boring. I mean it’s just sort of there. You’ll flip through the menus or play with the TV turned off. Nothing more. Multiplayer, taken in small doses, is fun, but still suffers the same performance issues. One player uses the GamePad, everyone else uses standard Wii Remotes and plays on the big screen, and everyone has the same type of tanks. There are four modes available, but you only really need to pay attention to one: My Kong. My Kong casts the player with the GamePad as a giant mecha-Donkey Kong of sorts, with her or his photo shellacked onto the beat monkey (you use photos of yourself in all the modes). As the boss, you stomp around, using several power-up attacks to bash and trash the other three players. It’s fun the first few times, and actually the overhead perspective of the giant gorilla makes navigation easier, and the controls are a bit smoother. TTT isn’t that good. Blowing up stuff is fun, but you’ll end up fighting the controls and the game becomes a grind if you play it any real length of time. If my eight- year-old son would rather play something else, you probably will too.
Ryan Clements	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/10/just-dance-4-wii-u-review	" Just Dance 4 will pull you, sweaty and breathless, through a drug-induced marathon across the world. From the streets of South Asia, alive with moving graffiti, to the dizzying innards of a pinball machine, the tonal inconsistency of Just Dance 4 pushes disorientation to its limits. This successor to the legendary dance brand continues to promise accessible play and a hip soundtrack, but falls victim to familiar ills. It's less a video game and more a dissonant, audio/visual experience designed for media-savvy parties. The only thing that Just Dance 4 succeeds at is catering to gamers that ""just don't care."" Most of this group contains newcomers to gaming and the socially drunk. With no way to fail out of songs and no progression system outside of an ever-growing Mojo meter, Just Dance 4 is designed to keep party-goers on their feet and laughing. But that's a shallow achievement. It's like showing up to the party with really cheap beer; it serves a basic purpose, but lacks the richness and flavor of better brews. From the beginning, Just Dance 4 masks its psychedelic journey in a harmless menu with only two options: Just Dance mode and Just Sweat mode. In an era of overcomplication, such simplicity can provide a much-needed oasis for weary gamers. Just Dance mode facilitates a quick jump into play, while Just Sweat mode strings along songs and stretches for an adjustable workout routine.  But when the dancing begins, Just Dance 4 starts to unravel in both quality and sanity. As with past Wii entries in the series, the Wii U version bends to the will of the mighty Wii Remote, restricting possible motion detection. Although Just Dance 4 encourages you to dance along with the on-screen guide, the only dancing that really matters is your right hand (congrats, Tutters, you've won).  Just Dance 4 starts to unravel in both quality and sanity.  For example, a well-danced, enthusiastic attempt at Carly Rae Jepsen's ""Call Me Maybe"" -- you may have heard of it -- net me about 9,000 points (a personal average from three attempts). An attempt with isolated hand movement, mimicking the dance moves with my right hand only, scored an impressive 10,656 points. And just shaking the Wii Remote to the beat racked up 7,289 points. It's imprecise technology at best, though in Just Dance 4's shallow pursuits it services the happy, screaming crowd well enough. Somehow, one of the more &#Array;normal&#Array; backdrops. Of course, shortly after a few songs have been played, and depending on the order of your selection, you'll start to notice the hysterical, mind-bending visuals used as backdrops. Some match the songs' themes with grace and a smiling nod. Others stretch reality like a hearty dose of lysergic acid diethylamide. ""Call Me Maybe"" and ""Good Feeling"" paved the way for ""Asereje,"" where a pair of senoritas danced on orange slices in a giant cocktail. This shocking playlist tumbled into a European town with electro-powered plazas, then wound its way to pink-colored cloudscapes. One song even stretched into the heavens, where entire galaxies pulsed with the rhythm.  Perhaps this is an abstract form of rickrolling.  And who's to say why Rick Astley's ""Never Gonna Give You Up"" features a costumed superhero and a full-fledged Godzilla attack? Perhaps this is an abstract form of rickrolling. Even if the audio/visual experience was more consistent, Just Dance 4 still stumbles in its actual play, repeating poor systems that have disrupted previous dance games like a bad sense of rhythm. The choreography employed by the on-screen dancers is impossible to deconstruct without an extensive, pre-existing knowledge of dance. Instead of repeatable, patterned choreography, the dancers string together elaborate sets of techniques that no amateur will ever understand on a first, third, or even fifth attempt. Barry White in an elevator? Sure. This stands in stark contrast to Just Dance 4's wide-eyed promises of accessibility and party-friendly entertainment. The routines will render even a comfortable dancer twisted and confused, laughing perhaps, but unable to follow along.  Routines will render even a comfortable dancer twisted and confused.  The ""pictograms"" which slide by the bottom of the screen don't alleviate this issue as they poorly convey upcoming dance moves and, on rare occasion, even contain incorrect information that clashes with the on-screen dancer. Having one pictogram with a silhouette pointing to the left just doesn't help when the following dance includes a 15-second flurry of moves with no further instruction. Completing songs will fill a Mojo gauge that unlocks additional content like battle mode songs and extra routines. The constant acquisition of precious, precious Mojo does bless Just Dance 4 with a modicum of satisfying level progression, but it's ultimately a trivial system. The same can be said of the newly toted Puppet Master mode, which allows the holder of the Wii U GamePad to select routines for other players. While this hints at a potential, mischievous fun, it doesn't overcome the problems inherent to Just Dance 4's design. The bizarre artistic direction of Just Dance 4's audio/visual components, coupled with its absurd choreography, cripple the player experience found within. This dance party game may illicit a few laughs, but nothing more worthwhile. Just Dance 4 is a generator of awkward moments, an engine powering missteps and bodily mayhem. Whether this is frustrating or fun will often come down to the blood alcohol level of the participants."
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/03/espn-sports-connection-review	 On paper, ESPN Sports Connection sounds awesome: It’s a mini-game collection that bundles six different sports, but instead of carnival-game versions of each, you can play full matches. Sports Connection doesn’t quite realize that goal thanks to its neutered versions of various sports. These games are shallow like mini-games because they’re treated as such – you can play a whole baseball game, but the interaction is extremely limited. There’s little respect paid to the complexity and depth of each sport, so those who’d appreciate ESPN Sports Connection are those it disappoints most. It’s not just limitation that hampers the way you play, but basic functionality problems too. Baseball matches involve awkward lifting and twisting of the GamePad to catch fly balls, and one simple swing motion with the Wii Remote – Sports Connection requires Wii Motion Plus, but doesn’t take advantage of its accuracy whatsoever. Defending in football involves touching too-small character icons to give on-the-fly movement commands, while offense is an inconsistent mixture of waggle gestures and d-pad aiming. Tennis, soccer, golf and kart-racing are the most tolerable of the lot, but each has its own egregious offenses. With the gyroscope or d-pad, you’ll point a slow kart around a lifeless track. Soccer, meanwhile, relies on a “run, pass, kick, repeat” cycle with little reliance on player skill. Goaltender success seems random, and the opponent A.I. is seriously lacking even on the highest difficulty – it’s easy to breeze by and maintain control of the ball, at which point scoring is in the hands of the powers that be. Smacking a ball back and forth in tennis functions almost identically to Wii Sports, with stylus-flicking replacing Wii remote waggle if you’re using the GamePad. Like golf, tennis works, but it’s been done better elsewhere – there’s a distinct lack of precision in Sports Connection that’s not up to the standard established six years ago. At its best, ESPN Sports Connection is a shallow collection that makes a mockery of sports you love. There’s no substance to any of these, and some serious technical problems only make matters worse. Sports Connection runs significantly slower in multiplayer; frame rate drops are unfortunately common. Loading screens might be the least tolerable thing here – it’s not an exaggeration to say it takes more time to load into a kart race or tennis match than to complete them.    Even if Sports Connection avoided these significant core issues, the absence of progression leaves little reason to play at all. There’s minimal character customization and no meaningful unlock or progression system. The fact that the performance is even worse with multiple players is a complete deal-breaker. Even with two people, each game slows to a crawl and just doesn’t feel right. There are also interruptions with frequent pop-up menus, and it’s annoying to have to switch controllers in secondary modes such as soccer’s penalty kick challenge. Everything ESPN Sports Connection does has been achieved already. Older sports games - including the original Wii’s pack-in, Wii Sports - accomplished the same goals better and without embarrassing technical issues. The convenience of bundling these particular games into one box simply isn’t worth it – there’s so little to motivate and reward players that the limited novelty of competitive sports on Wii U vanishes almost immediately.
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/12/03/funky-barn-wii-u-review	 To those still undecided on whether to pick up a Wii U before Christmas, I BET it’s because you’ve been holding out for our review of Funky Barn. I can only apologise for the slight delay in getting it to you. 505 Games’ cute little farm-strategy game for Wii U initially comes across as a kind of proto-Harvest Moon, but in reality it’s more of a real-time strategy affair – a mix of Farmville and Theme Park. It’s not terrible – actually it’s pretty entertaining, if basic – but it hasn’t got enough going on to justify a full launch-game price. Funky Barn puts you in charge of a run-down farm and tasks you with building it up to verdant productivity again, populating the paddocks with cute animals and building various barmy contraptions to make your farming life easier. It’s these machines – a gigantic egg robot that collects eggs for you, a shearer that plucks sheep from the field with its gloved, mechanical hand and relieves them of their wool – that give Funky Barn personality, making it more likeable than the bare-bones presentation initially indicates. As your farm starts to run itself more effectively, you’ve got more time to expand and build more stuff. It gets that Farmville compulsion loop exactly right. Between collecting produce, building things here’s always just enough going on that your mind doesn’t get the chance to think that maybe you’d be better off doing something else. Every fifteen minutes or so you can order a new animal, ranging from cows, sheep and chickens in the early stages of the game to llamas and buffalo later on, delivered by a charming stork. You can give your animals a wee stroke with the Gamepad to increase their happiness, which is sadly pretty pointless – happy animals make more produce, but you’ll never be bothered to take the time to furiously scrub at all your animals with the stylus once you’ve got more than about four of them. Presentation is at best functional. The game’s opening sequence is a series of slightly wonky, still cartoon images apparently drawn in ten minutes by somebody who can’t quite get hands right. The loading screen is a blinking cow drawing. The animals are cute, but extremely simplistic – the chicks are blobs with eyes. This game’s clearly been put together on a tiny budget, and there is absolutely no visual flair here at all. Instructions and tips are text-only, and even the font looks budget. In-game, there’s a sub-Wii level of detail.  It’s not a lazy game, just a cheap one.  That said, it’s not a lazy game, just a cheap one. The controls have actually been thought through well – it’s designed for a touch-screen (a 3DS version of the game came out in September), so it makes the transition to Wii U very well. You use the stylus to move around and select things on the farm, and pick up and drop animals or buildings with the triggers on the back of the gamepad. Placement is sometimes a little awkward, though – placing fences and roads on the farm is a little mode fiddly than it should be. There’s really not much else to say about Funky Barn, which is the problem, really; it doesn’t take long to get your farm up to the highest level if you’re a halfway competent player (it took me less than five hours), at which point you’ve exhausted all the off-beat contraptions and exotic animals that the game has to offer. There are three challenge farms, which give you a totally screwed-up farm to fix within a time limit, but they don’t offer anything different. Funky Barn is very basic but passably entertaining. As a lower-price downloadable game it’d be much better value, but as a $50/£30 Wii U launch title it’s more difficult to recommend. Still, the touchscreen control works well, and it's by no means a disaster. It bodes well for the next Harvest Moon.
Chris Schilling	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/30/sonic-all-stars-racing-transformed-wii-u-review	 After the disappointing LittleBigPlanet Karting and the rather lightweight F1 Race Stars, it’s hardly been a banner year for kart racers. Yet the ever-reliable Sumo Digital may just have changed all that. Sonic and Sega All-Stars Racing Transformed might have an unwieldy title, but it’s a beautiful, inventive racer that dares to be a little different. For once, the Mario Kart comparisons aren't warranted. Of course, you could be forgiven at first for thinking the developer had been looking over Nintendo’s shoulder and copying its homework. After watching that initial E3 trailer of Mario Kart 7, showcasing its gliding and underwater sections, the folks at Sumo groaned: their idea had been well and truly gazumped. Yet it turned out the difference these tweaks made to Nintendo’s beloved series were relatively subtle; the changes here are, appropriately enough, much more transformative.  That’s because a good deal of the time you spend racing won’t be on a solid surface. At various scripted points the track will disappear beneath your wheels as Sega whispers in its best Doc Brown voice: “where we’re going, we don’t need roads.” You’ll hear a few brief metallic whirrs and clanks, accompanied by a vaguely familiar, Hasbro-baiting sound and your vehicle will either take to the skies or speed across the surface of the clearest, bluest waters you’ve seen since Wave Race. This makes for some truly adventurous tracks, many of which are entirely different on the second and third laps. An AfterBurner-themed stage sees you soar through skies before swooping down and drifting around an aircraft carrier, ready to line up your next take-off, while a Golden Axe track sees you plunging into a sea of gloopy orange lava. Even the Sonic stages, which you might expect to be the safest of the bunch, are filled with creative flourishes - from the barrier-free ribbon of undulating track in Galactic Parade that feels like a Rainbow Road tribute act to the crumbling masonry of Sanctuary Falls. Each level is filled with shortcuts and alternate routes and it’ll take several replays before you find them all. It’s a lovely-looking game, too, with lots of crash-bang-wallop effects, dazzling lights and sundry other visual tricks. Tracks are bright, expansive and hugely detailed. It’s incredible the frame-rate manages to stay as solid as it does. There are one or two minor hitches, but you’ll barely notice as you focus on staying ahead of some surprisingly competent AI rivals. All this visual opulence does come at a slight cost, however. Occasionally things can get so busy that it’s easy to drive straight into a speed-sapping hazard, and once or twice – particularly while airborne – you may lose sight of where you’re supposed to be going. Though for the most part tracks are well signposted, you’ll occasionally be guided back on course by an invisible hand, while sections of the course that look invitingly accessible are revealed to be anything but, as you’re suddenly and rather crudely reset to the place you ‘fell off’. In that sense, it’s not quite as tightly designed as a Mario Kart, but it’s telling how infrequently you’ll think of Nintendo’s game when you’re playing. While the original felt like Sega’s attempt to piggyback the success of gaming’s greatest spin-off, Transformed is very much its own beast. When you’re messing about in boats you’re more likely to think of Hydro Thunder Hurricane, while lifting off into the blue is as different from Mario’s fluttering descents as it’s possible to get. It can seem a little slow at times when you’re floating among the clouds, but turbo gates and mid-air drifts are there to give you a bit of a speed boost.  It’s very smartly structured. The Career mode takes you down a series of branching pathways; success often unlocks more than one route forward, with others only accessible once you reach a certain star tally. Each event has three difficulty settings, meaning that youngsters should be able to reach the end by earning bronze medals, but the additional characters and bonuses will only be available to those who challenge themselves at the very top level – and earning the full three stars is tough, even in the early stages. Meanwhile, there’s a welcome variety of events, from vanilla races to drift and boost challenges via ring races and traffic attack modes, with new characters unlocked by beating their fastest lap time. There are a few combat-focused asides, also: Pursuit asks you to bring down a rampaging tank with missile pickups as it fires rockets back at you, while Battle mode requires you to use your arsenal of weaponry to eliminate rival racers. Again, the weapon set differentiates this game from its peers. A baseball glove can catch incoming projectiles (though you can also boost-dodge out of harm’s way when the klaxon blares), while a blowfish can puncture the hopes of a persistent opponent on your tail. A drone can latch onto the racer in front to give them a shock while the Hot Rod gives you a temporary boost and a fiery blast that must be released before you overheat. Elsewhere, the wonderfully malicious whirlwind reverses your target’s controls - though of course, should it hit you, it suddenly becomes profoundly irritating, particularly in multiplayer. Whether you’re racing on or offline, there are plenty of modes on offer, from traditional races to more battle-focused options. Split-screen local play sacrifices a little detail for the sake of speed and fluidity; pre-release, however, we’ve been unable to test the quality of Sega’s netcode. It’s a balanced and entertaining racer, then, but above all else, Transformed is incredible fan service. Long-time Sega acolytes will delight at some of the characters and stages, and it’s to Sumo’s credit that it’s prepared to dig a little deeper than the obvious favourites. Cult heroes like Skies of Arcadia’s Vyse rub shoulders with Space Channel 5’s Pudding, all racing through stages based on Shinobi, Panzer Dragoon and Burning Rangers as Ristar waves the chequered flag. The final surprise in particular – we won’t spoil it, but it’s a cracker - can only have been conceived by a studio that knows and loves Sega as keenly as any fanboy. Amid a sea of sloppy ports, the Wii U version Sonic and All-Stars Racing Transformed shines like a veritable beacon: with the possible exception of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 it’s the best multiplatform title on the console, and might just have the edge over the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, not least because offline play is now available for five players instead of four.  The ability to play on the GamePad is an undoubted bonus. Normally it displays a map of the course (all the better for seeing who’s behind you so you can lay a blowfish or prepare a boost –dodge from an incoming projectile), but you can also use it as a weapon camera and a rear-view mirror. Meanwhile, a vertical swipe of your finger drags the image from your TV onto that 6.2-inch screen.  Visually, as with the other console versions, it’s a little soft around the edges, which makes for a slightly fuzzier GamePad image than in other games. On the plus side, it’s a particularly welcome feature for local multiplayer – particularly in one-on-one races where neither player has to share a screen with their rival. And talking of graphics, they’re a comfortable match for the other versions, and to our untrained eye the frame-rate seems a little more consistent when the action hots up.  Elsewhere, there are two Wii U exclusive multiplayer modes that both task the GamePad player with bumping into those playing on the TV screen. Ninja Tag asks Joe Musashi to convert his rivals to the ninja cause, while Banana Heist puts you in a giant Monkey Ball, your job to roll into the other players before they collect all that lovely fruit. You can also unlock the ability to play as your Mii by completing Grand Prix mode, and though the vehicle they drive is as nondescript as they come there’s some amusement to be found in their nonsensical babbling as they pass other racers or get hit by a weapon.  These additions are nothing life-changing, then, but they’re fun asides that add extra value to what’s already a bumper package. Those who can’t wait for Mario Kart to arrive on Nintendo’s new console should find this fills the gap very nicely indeed. Beyond its obvious appeal to Sega fans, this is a rich, bold and substantial arcade racer that demands your attention. It might not be quite as finely tuned as Mario Kart, but it’s a good deal more ambitious, and different enough that it deserves a place alongside it in your gaming library.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/29/disney-epic-mickey-2-the-power-of-two-review-2	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review. Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two tries to be many things. It’s a co-op game. It’s a musical. It’s a platformer with elements of choice and consequence. It’s a lovingly crafted homage to the Disney of yesteryear and its iconic theme parks. Junction Point Studios has also tried to address many of the complaints directed at the original Epic Mickey. The troublesome camera has been tinkered with, previously mute characters speak, and the game’s RPG elements have been dragged into the foreground. Everything about this game screams of a determination to get Disney Interactive Studio’s great black and white hope right this time. But the weight of Junction Point’s ambition has resulted in a game that buckles at the knees. While Epic Mickey 2 retains the Disney charm so lovingly injected by designer Warren Spector, its nostalgic heart is its high point. Visually, Epic Mickey 2 is a gift to be savored. Practically, it’s plagued with issues.  Epic Mickey 2 returns us once again to the Wasteland, the sprawling home to rejected or long forgotten toons from Disney’s considerable back-catalogue. Never a place to relax for long, Wasteland is now plagued by earthquakes, returning it to a pile of rubble and sputtering machinery. The newly-reformed Mad Doctor calls for a hero, a magical television is built, and voila! Mickey Mouse is again on a repair mission, armed with his trusty paintbrush that enables him to paint or thin out parts of his environment. This time, he’s got a permanent partner in Oswald the Lucky Rabbit; the more charming of the two by the width of a detachable arm. The game is again a journey of discovery through a world built from discarded Disney memorabilia and broken down animatronics, a heaving, twitching place that should be a delight to nosy around in for the Disney enthusiast.  References to Disney properties are everywhere, from old favorites like Pete’s Dragon to modern classics like The Nightmare Before Christmas. It’s a particular joy stumbling across a visual nod to a film or dusty old short you forgot the moment you hit puberty. Spector’s peculiar combination of cold mechanics and warm Disney familiarity returns, and when it works, it sings: a door that requires you to pull a wooden Snow White and Prince Charming into an embrace is the sort of touch that lingers, as is a complex mechanical system activated by characters from Disneyland’s Main Street Parade. The aesthetic is most endearing when Mickey and Oswald are traversing across 2D landscapes, which lean heavily towards the abstract. These transitional sections - Frankenstein's Monster versions of classic Disney shorts - are the most visually arresting of Epic Mickey 2’s playable areas. You push, I pull. There’s pleasure to be found in Epic Mickey 2’s cut-scenes, too. Lightning has struck twice for Powerhouse Studio, the outsourced animation team reunited to create Epic Mickey 2’s retro-flavored 2D cut-scenes. These are a stunning visual highlight, Powerhouse capturing a character’s bemusement or glee with just a raise of a squiggle or a slight shift of a black dot. The team has done well to create animations that retain Spector’s mad vision while feeling distinctively old-school. There are a couple of immediately obvious new additions to the formula. Characters now have voices, adding refreshing personality to fan favorites, and there’s the occasional musical number. Strangely, these songs – all led with goofball gusto by the Mad Doctor - are too sporadic to leave a lasting impression. For all the talk of Epic Mickey 2’s Broadway-style ambitions, they’re a nice but inessential touch. Like its predecessor, Epic Mickey 2’s score is excellent, a haunting mixture of children’s choruses, sweeping orchestra and throwbacks to tunes of yesteryear. Although it won’t play at the forefront of your consciousness, the music subtly changes based on your decisions throughout the game.  At least to the ear, Epic Mickey 2 does a good job at making you feel like you’re playing something much grander than a passable platformer. Running from the past... Because for all its ambition, Epic Mickey 2 has failed to get some very basic features right. While simplistic minute-to-minute gameplay is forgivable – this is a kid’s game, after all – Mickey’s central objectives eventually grow repetitive and tiresome. The slog of reviving dead machines over the course of 20 hours is exacerbated by audio cues that remind you of your task-at-hand in a never-ending loop (I guarantee you’ll end up wanting to throttle your gremlin compadre.) In a universe as rich as Disney’s, collecting missing pumps and inserting batteries into sockets leaves you yearning for something a little less pedestrian. The addition of two new types of ink – invisible and indelible – mixes the gameplay up somewhat, but rarely do they prove essential in any given objective. It would have been refreshing to have seen these used more frequently throughout the campaign, or indeed, more creatively; a combination of an indelible Mickey and an invisible Oswald would have made for an interesting dynamic, and sections requiring a slightly more demanding use of stealth would have added some needed tension. Perhaps most frustrating in the list of the game’s missteps is the return of that wonky camera that so plagued the original. The player can manually manipulate Epic Mickey 2’s camera, but it always wants to return to a position that sits too low. This is chiefly problematic when trying to pull focus in battle, and bosses, who loom over Mickey and Oswald, take a particularly long time to defeat. The problem is worsened when combined with Epic Mickey 2’s slippery surfaces; trying to judge distances in more delicate platforming sections often leads to wild leaps of faith and untimely death. For this reason, motion control is recommended - aiming with a PlayStation Move controller feels more intuitive, and the ability to target accurately will ease a part of the struggle.  These issues aren’t offset by the much hyped choice and consequence that forms the backbone of Epic Mickey 2. Sometimes it’s clear why you’re being punished for an action – you deliberately took the easy route, or destroyed too many enemies – but frequently your behavior feels arbitrarily judged.  Perhaps you accidentally set an enemy free from a cage, or thinned a piece of machinery that apparently you shouldn’t have. It’s an oddly muddy system, which only makes sense if pointed out. To the developer’s credit, there are indeed consequences to your actions, although only rarely will these affect you in any palpable way. Perhaps you’ll cast a fleeting glance at a section that’s sealed off, or raise an eyebrow when a character obstinately declares he won’t help you for the rest of your campaign. But, at the 19-hour mark, you won’t angst over your missed opportunities too much. And, by game’s end, any repercussions cease to matter. Mickey must prevail, after all. This focus on the journey of Epic Mickey 2 is also a focus on re-playability, but what with Epic Mickey’s epic length and its uninspired gameplay, only the most die-hard Disney fanatics will likely play through again.  Only the most die-hard Disney fanatics will likely play through again.  If you want to get the most out of Epic Mickey 2, you’d best deviate from the main path altogether, and explore its nooks, crannies and charming side-quests, of which there are many. For this, you need a human co-op partner. As a split-screen game, Epic Mickey 2 is kicked into life, opening itself up to much more intuitive exploration. Oswald is a satisfying character to control, too, his ear-propeller skill versatile in frequently vertical level design. The A.I-controlled Oswald, on the other hand, is infuriatingly inconsistent, occasionally disappearing for entire sections, or yelling out his acknowledgements of your commands - ""I got it!"" ""I know how to do this!"" - while remaining stationary. He’s able to fumble his way through the game for the most part, but leaves you wishing for a proper, communicative partner. While Epic Mickey 2’s co-operative battling and platforming is simplistic – Oswald zaps and flies while Mickey paints and jumps – it begs for a little human finesse. As for controller options, don’t expect to paint using the Wii remote like in the original Epic Mickey, or even like in the Wii version of Epic Mickey 2. For some reason, you can only control Mickey using the GamePad, with the Wii remote being relegated to co-op mode, allowing the second player to control Oswald (who doesn’t even paint, making the lack of Mickey Wii remote control that much more frustrating). This is a strange oversight, especially since the Wii U (and even this very game) still very much supports Wii remotes, and that the entire franchise was originally built around the idea of painting with Nintendo’s motion-enabled controller. Speaking of wasted potential, if the developers wished to shove the Wii U GamePad down players’ throats, they should have at least done something interesting with it. As is, the GamePad is only used as a map screen where you can also see objectives, side missions and points of interest. Having a map handy is always helpful, but far from a game changer. Wii U Difference section by IGN Editor Audrey Drake Ultimately, there is a feeling here of missed opportunity. Junction Point Studios tried hard to revolutionize the wheel, but Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two leaves you wishing the developer had refined the mechanics of the original before embarking on its more intrepid endeavors. The game still delivers on the charm and occasionally hits some truly inspired highs, but fundamental issues hold it back from ever getting within sight of its goals. If you’re a Disney fan, there’s still much joy to be gleaned out of Epic Mickey 2, but those expecting anything outside of its nostalgic heart should, sadly, look elsewhere."
Lucas M. Thomas	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/29/warriors-orochi-3-hyper-review	" Warriors games don’t seem to work on Nintendo systems. We’ve seen a handful of them over the years, but they’ve all been disappointments – from the mediocre button-mashing of 3DS launch title Samurai Warriors: Chronicles, to the bland Wii remote waggling of Samurai Warriors: Katana, to the 2010 Wii release of Samurai Warriors 3, which earned a review score equal to the number in its name. So it’s a bit of a surprise that Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper is actually good.  If you’ve never played a Warriors game – and, if you’re a Nintendo loyalist, that’s fairly likely – this series is best known for its massive battle sequences. You take command of a hero drawn out of actual world history and send them into huge skirmishes against hundreds upon hundreds of foes, hacking and slashing your way through entire armies of ancient Chinese or Japanese soldiers. That’s a split in the series, as Chinese history has always been the focus of KOEI’s Dynasty Warriors games, while Samurai Warriors titles deal with events from Japan’s Warring States era. The Warriors Orochi games, though, fuse those two separate halves of the franchise into one. Casting historical accuracy aside, these titles disregard proper chronology to put Chinese and Japanese historical figures on the battlefield together. Then they go a step further, introducing magic and monsters and all kinds of other fantasy elements that further remove each sequel from what was, once, a somewhat accurate take on ancient events. This is where Warriors Orochi 3 comes in. You take command of a trio of commanders who’ve just seen their armies decimated by the appearance of a massive, multi-headed Hydra. The beast is too powerful to defeat with only the handful of warriors who are still alive, so your heroes embark on a time-traveling quest – jumping back through history to save the lives of other fallen heroes in the midst of the legendary battles in which they were originally killed. It’s an exciting, otherworldly premise – like going back to rescue Abraham Lincoln moments before he was shot – and assembling the team of historical legends is satisfying. There are a lot of legends to assemble, too, as the game contains well over 100 playable heroes to ultimately recruit, each with their own unique weapons and play style. Some of them defy history altogether – Ryu Hayabusa and Rachel, from the Ninja Gaiden series, are two such fictional icons you can rally to your cause. The game also manages to be fun in its simplicity and repetition, as button-mashing your way through hordes of foes here feels less tedious than in some past Warriors titles. This is thanks to the fact that you’re always controlling a trio of characters that you can swap dynamically back and forth between – and there are special moves and flashy effects in place to complement your repeated pressing of the Y Button over and over again. Altogether, Warriors Orochi 3 is an especially solid installment for the series that has, perhaps, the highest body count out of any active franchise. Wait, is that a machine gun? And where have I seen her before? All of that praise is earned by the core game of Warriors Orochi 3, though – and we’re here primarily to evaluate Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper. The difference is, like several other titles in the Wii U launch lineup, this game is a  re-release of the PS3 and Xbox 360 original with added content. And the process of bringing this one to Wii U seems to have been a difficult one. Framerate drops are especially frequent in each battle, as the game struggles to keep up with the hundreds of individual soldiers it’s trying to render on-screen simultaneously. Pop-in is hilariously apparent at every turn, as you’ll run across a battlefield and entire battalions of foes will simply appear out of thin air right in front of you. Some will be rendered correctly, appearing first in the distance and growing closer as you dash to engage them. But at least half your opponents will simply pop into existence out of the aether.  Wii U’s GamePad is also put to little use, most often just streaming the very same video feed being sent to your TV screen. This allows you to utilize Off-TV Play and take your game along with you to the kitchen, bathroom or wherever your system’s signal stays strong, but it’s clear that little effort was put into really taking advantage of that screen in your hands. An alternate option lets the GamePad display a mini-map instead of echoing the TV entirely, which is a bit more helpful, but even that feels limited as the map is often difficult to discern. Is this all another example of the on-going incompatibility of the Warriors series with Nintendo systems? Perhaps, but there’s at least one new positive included in Wii U’s Hyper edition that the older versions didn’t get – Duel Mode. ""Tiger! Tiger! Tiger Uppercut!"" Duel Mode is an all-new versus mode built for two players, who each select a three-person team of characters and proceed to try to murder the other player’s squad. This can be good, addictive fun, as it’s exciting to see the Warriors series' gameplay transformed into something that is, essentially, a head-to-head fighting game. And since Ryu and a few of his other Tecmo friends are unlockable, it's almost like getting a new Dead or Alive title built in as a bonus. And once you've got a second player by your side to compete in Duel Mode, the game’s one beneficial use of the GamePad is uncovered as well – back in the main campaign, you and your friend can each have a display to yourself. With one of you playing on the Pad and one on the TV, no split-screen is required to take on missions in co-op mode. So don't beat your buddy too badly in the duels, as you'll want to keep them around for the time-traveling quest to take down that demonic Hydra. Warriors Orochi 3 Hyper, while damaged in the shift from the other HD systems to the Wii U, ends up maintaining its appeal as one of this series’ best installments. The new content may be enough to draw established players back in for a second look, and Nintendo loyalists who’ve previously ignored the franchise could find a good jumping-on point here."
Lucas M. Thomas	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/28/transformers-prime-the-game-wii-u-review	" For a pop culture property whose very name means change, Transformers sure has stayed locked into the same story structure for decades now. Regardless of how many reboots or alternate universe cartoons come along, they all hit the same beats – Optimus Prime leads the Autobots. Megatron leads the Decepticons. They fight. Starscream whines, humans are present for no good reason and everyone spends all their time freaking out about Energon. Occasionally, something truly brilliant and original emerges from this cycle – Beast Wars was incredible – but, for the most part, Transformers never really changes shape. Red, blue, turns into a truck. Yep, that&#Array;s Optimus again. And Transformers: Prime - The Game isn't breaking that mold either. This latest video game serves as the requisite interactive adaptation of the newest cartoon series, this time translating cable network The Hub's popular Transformers: Prime into playable form. Since it's locked into the storyline of the show, you can't expect to encounter much originality in plot here – Optimus, Megatron, fighting. ""One shall stand, one shall fall."" That same old song and dance. But – and here's the key to the game's success – the design actually does do things differently. So even while this development team was saddled with a too-familiar story from a too-familiar franchise, they managed to introduce innovation and fun where it counts – in the gameplay itself. Transformers: Prime - The Game divides its story mode evenly between five different Autobot heroes, the same core set of characters that carry the cartoon. Optimus Prime leads things off – headlining the introductory tutorial level that teaches you the combat controls – and it seems like the game is setting itself up to be a standard, by-the-numbers string of missions based on bashing endless waves of bad guy bots. But then Mission #2 takes a different approach, integrating a high-speed vehicle mode chase sequence starring female motorcycle-bot Arcee. Then Bulkhead takes charge of Mission #3, with his level focusing on a rushing escape from a collapsing cave. And then Bumblebee, in Mission #4, is given a more exploration-heavy stage to progress through, a non-linear dungeon that lets you choose which paths to take and when. So you're met with a ton of gameplay variety right off the bat, which is probably not what you'd expect going in to a licensed release like this – but it's a very good thing. Several past Transformers games have offered only the same style of play in level after level, but here you never know if you're about to step into a boss battle, or a car chase, or a brawl against a dozen hungry Insecticons. Each character feels different, too. The diversity is great.  Also crucially satisfying is the combat system featured here, which, again, has been a downfall of older Transformers titles – and, again, it's the variety factor that keeps things interesting. You can choose to engage Decepticons up close with traditional melee combos, which is standard. Or you can lock-on and pepper foes with lasers from a distance. Or you can put together a combination of the two, flowing fluidly back and forth between direct strikes and indirect shots – maybe you'll hit a baddie with a one-two punch to juggle him into the air, then blast him out of the sky to finish him off. Or you could just crash into them. This is the coolest part of combat, and one of the most exciting inclusions in the game – your vehicle mode is actually integrated into each fight. I've been waiting a long time for a Nintendo system Transformers game that understands the importance of these characters actually transforming, and Prime - The Game is it – you can quickly shift into car form and charge enemies head on, then dynamically leap off the ground with preserved momentum to clear long gaps or throw a flying punch, and then automatically transform right back into a car to keep zooming right along when you land. It's fantastic, and finally makes it feel like you are a Transformer – not just stuck in one mode or the other. Those humans are really, really little. Now, at this point, I've got to acknowledge that some similarly satisfying Transformers work has been done through 2010's Transformers: War for Cybertron and its sequel Fall of Cybertron, released just a few months ago for PC, Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. But Nintendo systems never got those games. We've been stuck dealing with cheap, watered-down knock-offs like Wii's Cybertron Adventures or the abysmal Transformers: Dark of the Moon - Stealth Force Edition, a game that didn't even let you transform out of vehicle mode. Yeah. So it's a little bit groundbreaking that we've finally got a Transformers title here on the Nintendo side of things that makes it genuinely fun to be a Transformer again. This game even finds a functional use for the unnecessary human friend characters. They serve as plot advancers by getting frequently kidnapped, of course, but beyond that they actually pipe in and talk to you during missions to offer advice and direction – in the grand tradition of the Star Fox franchise. (Though none of them ever told me to do a barrel roll.) Transformers: Prime - The Game then rounds out its design with a fairly predictable array of extras, like a gallery of character bios unlocked by finding hidden items in each stage and a multiplayer mode that lets you deathmatch against your friends – provided everyone has their own copy of the game. And the whole adventure ends too quickly, too, a feeling that's only made worse by the division of labor between the five different hero bots – each character only gets a brief time in the spotlight. For its Wii U iteration, Transformers: Prime - The Game doesn't offer much of anything special. It's clear that this version was crafted right alongside the earlier editions for Nintendo's less powerful machines, and so it simply looks like the same experience, upscaled. The high definition resolution makes it the best-looking of all the versions, but the models and textures are all the same here – much more could be done on Wii U, and hopefully a future Transformers release will be able to actually take advantage of the new system's power. Beyond the graphics, the gameplay is also nearly identical to the other editions. The Wii Remote + Nunchuck control scheme is carried over with no change from the Wii version, though you also have to option to play using just the GamePad. That's the best choice, because using the Pad eliminates the annoying waggle attacks and gives you a running stat tracker of how much damage you've taken, how many items you've collected and how much time has elapsed in the current mission – the three criteria that determine which ranking you'll earn in each level. It's kind of a bland usage of the second display, but it is a bit helpful. You can also choose to swap the displays, letting you play the game fully removed from the TV if you like. That's a nice feature, and it shows that at least a bit of extra effort was put into this Wii U version. Transformers: Prime - The Game is fun while it lasts, and fun in any form is more than Nintendo fans could have hoped for after years of other, terrible Transformers titles. This game offers the same old story with the same old characters one more time, adding nothing new to the tired old rivalry between Optimus, Megatron, and all the rest of the robots in disguise. But the inventive, dynamic gameplay that captures the appeal of stepping into the shape-shifting body of a giant bot rescues the entire package from what otherwise might have been mediocrity. This is a truly fun game, and fans of the Transformers: Prime cartoon show should absolutely check it out."
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/27/fifa-13-wii-u-review	 You might have noticed that IGN’s reviews of Wii U launch titles, providing they’re ports of existing games, consist of two parts: the review of the game already out and a section titled the ‘Wii U Difference’, which outlines how the game’s changed and what impact those differences have made to the overall experience, for better or for worse. It was an approach we were going to take for our review of FIFA 13 on Wii U, but it’s just not suitable. FIFA 13 shares very little with FIFA 13 on other platforms. It’s simply not the same game, despite being sold under the same title and using the same box art. It’s not a terrible experience – it’s still a decent game – but it’s important to know there are some major differences between FIFA 13 on Nintendo’s new console and the other versions already out there.  The core gameplay experience on Wii U is still largely the same as it was on FIFA 12, so it boasts the same trinity of innovations from a year ago – the Player Impact Engine, Precision Dribbling, and Tactical Defending. Those features were great a year ago, greatly improving the series. The first made players more tangible beings, colliding with weight and recovering from challenges realistically – well, at least most of the time. Occasionally, there are awkward tangles, but for the most part it makes matches more physical experiences. Precision Dribbling allows you to manipulate the ball deftly in close-quarters, letting you get out of sticky situations defensively or nick the ball around defenders in attacking situations. Finally, tactical defending was the biggest change. Defenders no longer functioned like ballistic missiles when called into action, abandoning their position and heading towards the ball. It’s a far more sophisticated approach to defending than has appeared in past FIFA games, and is based on a more subtle combination of applying pressure and forcing mistakes from your opponent. Combined, the features above advanced the series immeasurably, and if you’re used to playing FIFA on Wii, it’ll be like going through the Space Gate and entering a whole new universe. However, it’s worth noting that these three key gameplay mechanics lack the huge refinements made to them in other versions of FIFA 13. Furthermore, other versions of FIFA 13 have progressed the basic mechanics to set an even higher benchmark: for instance, the introduction of Complete Dribbling enhances Precision Dribbling, giving players even more control of the ball and advanced attacking AI gives you more options when in attack. Both are missing from the version on Wii U and as a result it feels rigid, and lacks the fluidity many FIFA fans now expect. Of course the FIFA experience on Wii U has its own unique feature set, not present on other consoles. This is largely to do with the integration of the Wii U’s GamePad, which introduces a variety of new ways to experience FIFA. Most of these features are pretty good, especially when it comes to performing more managerial duties. Additionally, you don’t need to play using the GamePad if you don’t want to, and can have a regular match of FIFA using the console’s Pro Controllers. The GamePad’s screen allows you to have several different views of the match, selected from a range of tabs displayed on the right-hand side of the screen. Firstly, you can stream the match directly to the controller’s screen and play it from there, even in another room. The touchscreen can also be used to pass the ball and send supporting players on runs. It works well from a technical perspective but in practice, it’s a bit awkward to use. As with other touchscreen versions of the game, your hands often end up obscuring the field of play and it’s tricky to use other essential inputs, such as sprint. Also, if you find yourself in a shooting position, shaking the GamePad displays a representation of the goalmouth on the screen, enabling you to tap to shoot. It’s a bit tricky to get used to, and difficult to execute in those high-pressure moments when you’re through on goal – odds are you’ll fluff the chance. Give your team a pep talk. Similarly, in dead ball situations, you’ll be asked to lift up the GamePad, which lets you see through the eyes of the player taking the kick. It makes free-kicks on goal slightly easier, but if you’re playing principally on the GamePad there’s a slight delay before the camera shifts back to the match. And although you can theoretically play an entire match on the GamePad’s screen, it’s not a great experience in practice since there’s no score or time displayed in the upper left-hand corner, so you have no idea how long’s left on the clock. The GamePad doesn’t revolutionise the way in which you play the game minute to minute. To that end, after a brief flirtation you’ll probably end up playing using the default control scheme you’re used to. However, it does transform the way in which you’ll manage your team. Making substitutions makes far more sense on a companion touchscreen while the game is playing out, rather than pausing the action and drilling down through a series of static menus. Similarly, switching tactics and formations feels like a more essential and crucial component of the game using the GamePad’s screen. As nice as some of the GamePad’s integration is, it can’t disguise the fact that FIFA 13 on Wii U lacks some other features that fans of the series don’t just want, they expect. Firstly, and most conspicuously, is the absence of Ultimate Team. Since its introduction in FIFA 11, Ultimate Team – a mode in which you swap players like trading cards and complete various challenges, privately and online – has quickly become one of the franchise’s most popular modes and for many it’s the default way they experience the game outside of playing one-off matches. FIFA 13’s producer said Ultimate Team hasn’t made it because “Nintendo’s online is in its infancy” and he added that “It’s building – FIFA Ultimate Team took five years to appear on 360 and PS3. They’re very complex features.” And he might be right, Nintendo’s online functionality is certainly behind that of its direct competitors, but the Wii U is a next-gen console and this is supposedly FIFA 13, so for it not to include Ultimate Team is a massive blow. The fact is, a huge part of the current FIFA experience is missing. Change your tactics on the fly. Furthermore, other online functionality has been stripped. There’s no Football Club, which has frequently been described by EA Sports as the “heartbeat” of FIFA, since it constantly tracks and monitors your stats against those of your friends and people in the community. But that heart has stopped beating in the Wii U version, and consequently it feels like a more isolated experience. Likewise, Match Day – which monitors the real life form of teams and players and adjusts in game stats accordingly and pulls in bespoke commentary – and Skill Games are nowhere to be seen. Together these omissions mount up and the result is an experience that feels out-dated and stale, despite it being on a brand new console. And as nice as the GamePad integration is for things like making subs, it can’t mask the obvious shortcomings. Elsewhere, the Wii U version does have co-op, which lets people play using a combination of traditional controllers and the GamePad. Basically, the person holding the GamePad is the manager and can dictate substitutes, tactics, and even send players on directed runs by using various touchscreen inputs. Like the GamePad integration in general it works well and might appeal more to families, but it’s no substitution for Ultimate Team. Ultimately, it says FIFA 13 on the box and has the same cover art, yet it’s a very different game from what you’ll experience on Xbox and PS3. If all you want is to play FIFA on your sofa with your new Wii U, it won’t disappoint. But if you’ve already played FIFA 13 on other consoles for any decent amount of time, going back to the mechanics from a year ago feels a strange experience. In comparison, matches feel that bit more restrictive and less fluid; the attacking AI isn’t as sharp and you have less control of the ball and fewer options going forward. Additionally, there’s no First Touch control, which in other versions of the game have moved not just the series but the entire genre forward in new and interesting ways. Visually, FIFA 13 on Wii U doesn’t quite cut it, either. The player likenesses are passable, but rarely excel. The biggest issue is the frame-rate, which noticeably stutters through a match, both following dead-ball situations and in the middle of the action, which can be extremely distracting. For a long time, Wii owners have had to accept diluted versions of FIFA; the graphics weren’t high definition and the gameplay didn’t have the same headline features. The Wii U should have changed all of that – this, after all, is the first of a next generation of consoles. But things haven’t moved on and the stark truth is Nintendo owners still don’t get the same experience they’d get on other consoles. The GamePad functionality does enhance certain aspects of the game – tactics and substitutions – but they are, of course, secondary to gameplay, which on the Wii U feels second division compared to the Xbox and PS3’s Premier League.
Anthony Gallegos	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/26/little-inferno-pc-review	 There’s still something entrancing, if not magical, about fire. Just like our ancestors have done for millennium, it’s easy to sit before a flame and lose yourself in the way it dances across the surface of whatever it’s destroying. It’s fun to see something change, to watch as it turns from order into ash. This mentality drives the gameplay of Little Inferno. Your character’s life revolves around the fireplace he sits in front of. The only thing you can do is order a random assortment of items and watch as countdown timers tick down before the packages containing your items arrive. Once they arrive you burn them, watch as the fire realistically lights and eventually breaks each item into ashes that a draft sweeps up into the night. Everything must burn. At first, setting things alight is enough. Learning the ignition point of each item, seeing how some of them react to being burnt, even just watching the flames rise and fall before dying feels good. But like eating one slice of pie too many, each new item you toss into the always-hungry maw of fire yields diminishing returns; the rush of destruction becomes pedestrian. This is where the combo system steps in to breathe new life into the flames. To unlock new catalogs brimming with precious objects to set aflame, you have to figure out which objects you need to burn together to satisfy preset criteria. This basically requires you to read a short phrase and then look through your catalog to see which pair or set of items it describes. So for instance if the phrase says “Wooden Block Combo”, you look through your catalogs and purchase the various types of wooden blocks you’ve unlocked, set them in the fireplace and burn them to see if you’ve appeased Little Inferno’s designers. Figuring out enough combos and burning every item in a catalog will then allow you to purchase the next catalog, unlocking more combos and so on. This gives much-needed direction to Little Inferno, though not all the puzzles are created equally. The vast majority of them are too obvious and the ones that use clever word play and require experimentation are too few. Thus the addition of puzzles only breathes momentary life into Little Inferno’s gameplay, like the quick flare of paper being tossed onto embers. Burning loses a bit more of its flair due to Little Inferno’s contrived limitations. Every item in the catalog costs coins, and to get coins you either kill the random bugs that wander into your fireplace or burn other items in the catalog. Cash becomes an unnecessary restraint, especially since you’re already limited by the amount of items you can hold in your inventory at a time. You have to use coins to expand this, but why not just have space unlock with each new catalog? Earning coins isn’t rewarding, it’s just a byproduct of picking the next item in the catalog and burning it. Likewise, the time constraints put on deliveries feels like an attempt to pad Little Inferno’s already short length. Every item in the catalog has a timer that ticks down before it’s delivered, and you can either wait for it to arrive or use some postage stamp currency you earn from combos to speed it up. When watching things burn and figuring out combos is the point, what’s the sense in making you wait? Yes, it encourages you to look for combos in order to earn postage, but I already want to do that in order to unlock more catalogs, which makes the time limitations especially annoying. Amongst the burning and buying Tomorrow Corporation has inserted a narrative of sorts into Little Inferno, but it’s vague to say the least. The sense of isolation established by locking your perspective on the fireplace works, and the letters that come into your mailbox establish how bizarre and broken your consumerism-obsessed world is without a word of spoken dialogue. These parts of the story give Little Inferno much needed intrigue, encouraging you to continue to burn even as it becomes increasingly tedious. Some items interact with others. The way the language changes in the letters you receive makes it seem like you’re working your way toward some greater truth, but Little Inferno’s ending left me bewildered, wondering what secret message I missed to make it better. The creepy tone of the art and music creates a world that feels like something out of a Tim Burton movie, but you see disappointingly little of it. With scant details about your own character, let alone anyone else, Little Inferno’s story just doesn’t engage me emotionally, spiritually or any other way. The message about burning money, buying everything you can and being a mindless consumer is there, but it’s wrapped around gameplay that just doesn’t stay interesting and a character that I have no investment in. Initially it’s a pleasure to burn every item I receive in Little Inferno. The flash that signals ignition, the way items respond to being incinerated – it all activates some primal part of my brain that can sit in front of a camp fire for hours, sinking deep into my head as I watch the fingers of the flames. The vague story and uninspired puzzles weren’t special enough to keep my attention after that initial sense of awe waned, though, and when viewed alongside some annoying constraints that make the gameplay feel unnecessarily constrained, Little Inferno’s few great ideas fall apart like so much ash.
	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/26/trine-2-directors-cut-review	" Lucas' Note: Trine 2 first launched for PCs. PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade a little less than a year ago, in December 2011. It earned a rating of 9/10 and an Editor's Choice Award from Daemon in his original review, and after playing the new Wii U edition I find that his thoughts are still perfectly appropriate today. So read Daemon's words here, then I'll jump back in at the end with ""The Wii U Difference"" section: A trine is a group of three. It was also a clever 2009 puzzle platformer starring a trio of adventurers, each with specific talents. Lucky us, now we have a sequel, Trine 2, that offers more fun physics-based challenges, more beautiful vistas, and adds online multiplayer to the mix. The first thing I noticed about Trine 2 is its stunning visuals. Each scene, from forests to caves to lazy beaches, shines with rich detail and startling lighting effects. There is always something amazing to distract you. Trine 2 easily makes for one of the prettiest games of the year. Trine 2&#Array;s trio of heroes. If you played the first Trine, you'll find a very familiar game here. Players run from left to right through fantasy spectacles, surmounting obstacles and slaying a few goblins along the way. You have three heroes at your disposal: a wizard that can conjure blocks and platforms, a thief with a bow and grappling hook, and a knight with sword, hammer, and shield. The brilliance of Trine 2 is that it mostly leaves the choice of which hero to use up to you. I love it when a game lets me off my leash and tells me ""have fun,"" – and that's the kind of game Trine 2 is. It does fail to teach the player some important mechanics, though, resulting in slight exasperation when you don't realize a solution is even possible. The wizard's platforms, for instance, can be stuck to swinging spiked maces, resulting in a pendulum conveyance. That's really cool, but it would have been nice to get a heads-up before I found myself stuck at the bottom of an ice slope for a little too long.  When playing by yourself you switch between the three heroes at will. In a matter of moments you might slash through some goblins as the knight, switch to the thief to grapple to a high platform, then switch to the wizard to move a heavy block in front of a flamethrower. Trine 2 is also very friendly about multiplayer gaming, allowing up to three players to join the adventure either locally or online. I find the game becomes easier this way because you've got more than just one brain working on problems and you can multitask, but it's still satisfying. The few boss fights prove slightly disappointing. While visually impressive, they don't require the same thought as the rest of Trine 2. Merely crossing a chasm can be a real conundrum, but felling a giant beast is as simple as giving it a few whacks to its weak spots. I do love the way the bosses are foreshadowed early on in levels, though. Trine 2 on the Wii U is labeled a ""Director's Cut,"" and rightly so – it further expands the adventures of Amadeus the Wizard, Pontius the Knight and Zoya the Thief by integrating the content of the Goblin Menace expansion right into the initial download. (See the trailer, embedded up above.) That download is a large one, though – much bulkier than any of the other Day 1 eShop-only releases in Nintendo's newest shop, so if you're planning to take the plunge, prepare to give up a bit more of your time to the downloading and installing process alongside a bigger chunk of your hard drive's free space. That investment of time, space and 20 bucks' worth of your money is well worth it, though, because Trine 2 shines on Wii U. The visuals are lavishly detailed, with an organic, living beauty that you can choose to view either on your TV or off – the whole game can be played solely on the GamePad if you choose. A variety of control schemes is implemented for several controller configurations, too, and each has it own appeal – using the GamePad you can conjure the wizard's blocks and platforms into existence using the touch screen. If you use a Wii Remote and Nunchuk instead, though, pointing at objects to levitate them or aim Zoya's arrows becomes easier. Trine 2's online multiplayer also worked out very well in my time testing it, though, as with any online game, you'll find better results if you coordinate with friends rather than jumping into games with strangers – because, should another player drop out of the session, your adventure is also immediately ended. So if you're looking to tackle Trine 2 as part of a player trio, I'd recommend making a plan to play with a couple of confirmed non-droppers ahead of time. Trine 2 throws players into a dazzling fantasy world and gives them three fun characters – tools, really – with which to save it. It's delightfully open-ended, from how you solve problems to whether or not you go it alone. Fans of puzzle games will not be disappointed."
	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/22/chasing-aurora-review	 The majesty of flight is the focus of Chasing Aurora, an indie-developed, bird-focused design that’s been making the rounds at shows like PAX through the past couple of years, and has now debuted in as a lofty a position as possible – as one of the five Day 1 Wii U eShop-only downloads. That sounds like a soaring success story, but, unfortunately, this project’s final form doesn’t quite fly as high as some might have hoped. The core of Chasing Aurora is built on three multiplayer “tournaments” that play out like the chase attractions found in Nintendo Land – they pit up to four Wii Remote-wielding players watching the TV against a fifth GamePad user who gets his or her own unique view. Freeze Tag is the first, and it casts the GamePad player as an Ice Bird who’s flapping around the arena trying to tag each opponent – while all the others share one view on the non-split TV screen, forcing them to flock close together to survive. Catch that bird! Hide & Seek is next, and it actually does split the TV into four separate zoomed-in views for the Remote wielders, who have to coordinate their effort to track down the GamePad-using Golden Bird who’s holding a magical orb. The goal of this mode is to hang on to the orb as long as possible – avoiding all the chasers if you’re the Golden Bird, or stealing the orb and flapping away with it if you started the round on the hunt. And the third chase mode is simply called Chase. It removes the GamePad player’s special privilege, lowering that controller’s status to being just another input device as every player tries to grab the orb and stay on the same screen with it. The orb holder tries to dive, dodge and evade their pursuers long enough to scroll the others off the display, and kind of like how you take damage for lingering out of the camera’s view in Super Smash Bros. games, staying scrolled out of the picture too long here kills your bird dead. Altogether, these three different multiplayer modes are fun enough to experience. But the same beneficial timing that allowed Chasing Aurora to debut alongside the Wii U as a Day 1 title might also hurt the game’s appeal for many early adopters, as the dynamics at play in Nintendo Land’s three different chase designs are similar to what you’re getting here – and most everyone who’d be likely to buy Chasing Aurora already has those experiences available for free. Chasing Aurora’s lone single-player mode also adds little appeal to the package, as it’s a simple challenge that sends you around in circles, over and over and over again. A track is laid out in the sky, and you send your bird soaring, diving and flapping his way through the hovering path markers around and around, making as many laps as you can until time runs out. That’s it. That single-player mode is so limited in scope, in fact, that I was surprised to learn that’s all there is to Chasing Aurora if you’re playing alone. That time-trial kind of gameplay and the multiplayer tournaments feel like they’d be the secondary modes of play in this design, put in place to complement some primary single-player story or adventure. But there isn’t anything like that here. It’s all secondary. So if you haven’t got local friends to call upon, all you can do in Chasing Aurora is chase your own tail. The package is presented beautifully, with the playable birds looking like their bodies have been made from folded paper, and each environment making a striking statement with sharp-angled set pieces and stylish water and wind effects. The team at Broken Rules – previously responsible for the visually arresting And Yet It Moves – clearly know how to craft eye-catching graphics. But other, behind-the-scenes aspects of this download disappoint – because it’s plagued by lengthy loading times, the framerate has a tendency to stutter and damage the otherwise gorgeous aesthetics, and some transitional menus make it seem like the team couldn’t quite decide how to handle having a second screen resting in the player’s hands. So Chasing Aurora looks spectacular and does succeed in capturing the feeling of being a soaring bird, but falls short most everywhere else. You’re not missing anything by skipping the limited single-player mode here, and the multiplayer offerings, while more compelling, are thematically similar enough to Nintendo Land’s chase designs that you’d be fine just sticking with the pack-in title there too.
Greg Miller	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/madden-nfl-13-wii-u-review	" As IGN reviews the Wii U launch lineup, a lot of the titles ported from other consoles are getting their original IGN review with a special Wii U section at the end. For Madden NFL 13, we're moving the special section to the very top. Why? Because Madden NFL 13 is a pretty faithful port -- except for the fact that it removes the Infinity Engine. PS3/360 football fans know that the Infinity Engine added physics to the PS3/360 version of Madden -- players collided with each other, and the game came up with a new animation on the spot based on how the players hit. It made every play look different, feel exciting. The Wii U doesn't have that. Instead, it's using canned animations. That's what every Madden before Madden NFL 13 was doing, so the effect isn't horrible, but it isn't the game changer we saw on PS3 and 360. We've left the original review below with the Infinity Engine references in it. No, it's not that we're lazy; it's that we want you to see what the other consoles got three months ago and how close the Wii U version is to that. Connected Career? In the Wii U version. Importing your face? In the Wii U version. The CBS-style TV presentation? In the Wii U version. The Wii U is pretty much the Madden experience on the other consoles, and that's impressive. The Wii U even adds a bunch of cool GamePad functionality. Before the snap, you can hold a receiver and draw out your own Hot Route. Before a defensive snap, you can tell players where to go when the action starts. This is really cool stuff. Navigating the playbook via the touchscreen took a bit too long and brought me close to a delay of game penalty, but as I learned my way around the systems, I shaved off a few seconds. In short, the Wii U is a great version of Madden. There's less detail in the graphics and the game seems to stutter more, but if I had no other choice, I'd play this version and be happy. Original Madden NFL 13 review follows...   Madden NFL 13 is an excellent football game. You could point to the gameplay improvements, the new physics engine or even the adlibbing commentators as to why the game works so well, but the truth behind the success comes down to the sum of the parts. Madden NFL 13 looks, feels and sounds like what we all watch on Sunday, and I can't stop playing it.  From the moment you hit start, Madden NFL 13 is a different beast. Rather than get dropped into mountains of disconnected menus, you're put directed to one hub screen that shows you how many players are online at that moment, gives you one-click access to your communities, and leaves your careers at your fingertips. There are different modes to Madden, but they all stem from the same place; Madden's identity crisis is over. The pop music and rappers are gone and in their place is an instrumental score driving home that this is the NFL and it's time to play football.  Madden NFL 13 does something the Madden franchise hasn't done in years: it makes me want to keep playing. Luckily, playing football in Madden NFL is a blast. Every time I put down the controller, I want to pick it back up and head out on the field. Madden NFL 13 is challenging this year with receiver icons that change depending on if the player is looking for the ball and defenses that aren't afraid to call me on my lack of a running game -- but I'm all about the struggle. I'm fighting for each and every yard I gain or keep from an opponent, and I'm relishing actually having to think on the field. See, EA tweaked a whole bunch of gameplay mechanics in Madden NFL 13. If you want to be the jaded gamer and say ""It looks just like last year,"" go ahead, but know that you're wrong. Yes, the graphics look as good as last year -- actually they're a bit better when you include the new TV graphics and the lush shade of a good Sunday afternoon game -- but there's plenty of under the hood enhancements that evolve the gameplay we all know. There are 25 new pass trajectories so you can put the ball out in front or just above the receiver. Defensive backs have to see the ball to make a play on it so there are no more psychic swats. You can abort play action after the snap. At a glance, Madden NFL 13 might just look like Madden, but in your hands, it feels polished. Now, a big part of that feeling is the much-touted Infinity Engine. Basically, this adds physics to Madden for the first time. Whereas a corner and a wideout would bump into each other in the air and then come down in the same spot they leapt from last year, Madden NFL 13 allows for helicopter hits and tumbles out of bounds. Contact matters and changes plays. It sounds exciting -- and spearing a receiver out of the air so that the trainers come out to check on him definitely is -- but I wasn't impressed at first. In fact, the place I saw the physics the most were when plays were blown dead and linemen stumbled over one another or receivers' legs got tangled with defenders. Expect jankiness to stand out, but don’t let it stop you from playing. The benefit of the Infinity Engine isn't the big plays; it's the fact that the small plays don't all look the same. In past Maddens, there were only so many tackle animations and ways a player could go down. After a while, it was easy to feel like you had seen it all. The Infinity Engine makes every hit a little bit different. Angles, weight and more matter. Watching a halfback break free of a shoddy tackle or a wideout come down just in bounds before stumbling over really amplifies how the game looks and feels. Sure, there are still wonky tackles and handoff animations, but the good outweighs the bad by a long shot -- especially if EA continues to refine the formula and deliver animations that aren't canned. This well-oiled gameplay is then combined with a brand new presentation, and this setup is really what got me going for Madden NFL 13. I made a video a few months ago arguing that Madden's robotic announcers and generic tickers were what was holding it back from being a true NFL experience, and it looks like EA agreed.  No longer are we subjected to a generic broadcast style. Madden NFL 13 packs primetime intros, a CBS-like graphics package, and replays out the wazoo. When a play's dead, there's still chatter from the players on the field, the crowd roars as a touchdown approaches, and the awkward inflections of previous commenters have been replaced with Phil Simms and Jim Nantz. EA let them adlib most of their lines so that there's actually rambling and stumbling similar to what we know and love. So you have this gameplay that feels challenging and interesting, on-field action that looks more fluid than ever, and then this TV presentation that makes your experiences seem like they're happening on Sunday and being watched by drunkards across the nation. This is what I mean when I say Madden is a unified NFL experience. EA gives you a lot to do with this package, but most of it should be familiar. There's online matchmaking, the ability to join private fan communities (IGN Podcast Beyond on PS3 and IGN Scrub Nation on Xbox 360), and the weird Ultimate Team mode where you get trading cards and assemble a squad. However, the big time sink in Madden NFL 13 is Connected Careers, and it is awesome. This year, Franchise, Online Franchise, create a player and the rest are all shoved into Connected Career. You choose to play offline or on, and then decide if you want to be coach, a specific player or create a character. From there, it's the same experience regardless of the role (preseason, cuts, draft and so on). Head coaches will play both sides of the ball while a superstar will only play when he should be on the field. If you want to be a coach and I want to just be a halfback, we can both get what we want and play in the same online career. If I get bored of being a halfback, I can retire that player and start a new one or a coaching career in that same universe we've created -- complete with evolving draft classes and storylines to watch. It is 30 seasons of whatever we want. But what really hooked me when it comes to Connected Careers is practice and experience points in general. Each week, you as your player or coach can choose from a laundry list of practice scrimmage scenarios -- down in the third, up at halftime, etc. -- and hit the field to try and take home the XP. Then, you can apply the reward to your created player or team and build a legacy in the image you want.  This kept me coming back to Connected Careers week after week. I liked the idea of XP in NCAA Football, but I always thought it was an unbalanced system as completion after completion would earn me my coach's trust but one INT could wipe it all out. Madden NFL 13's system is far more rewarding and actually allows me to build the character I want on a stat by stat basis. The fictional Twitter feed commentating on my NFL's top stories and the NFL Draft packing audio commentary about the fictional players are nice touches, but the way Madden deals with XP is the real story this year. Madden NFL 13 does something the Madden franchise hasn't done in years: it makes me want to keep playing. Yes, the commentators will repeat themselves and funky animations are going to pop up, but the game as a whole is so good. The Wii U drops the physics, but it adds some nifty GamePad functionality. Nintendo's version could run smoother, though."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/mass-effect-3-wii-u-review	 Editor’s Note: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of Mass Effect 3, as well as how it holds up compared to other iterations of the game, scroll down to the “Wii U Difference” section at the bottom of the review.   Few games come with the amount of hype Mass Effect 3 has swirling around it. As the culmination of BioWare's epic sci-fi RPG trilogy, Mass Effect 3 hasn't garnered this groundswell in an artificial way. Rather, anticipation steadily sits at a fever pitch because the previous installments -- Mass Effect, and especially Mass Effect 2 -- rate amongst the best games ever made. And in many ways, Mass Effect 3 has set the bar even higher as the worthy conclusion to one of the finest stories ever told in gaming history, even if it's still admittedly imperfect. Mass Effect 3 throws you back into the role of Commander Shepard, the first human Spectre that has, at this point in the story, gone above and beyond proving his (or her) commitment to galactic order. After reluctantly working for the xenophobic human-first organization Cerberus and jumping through the Omega-4 Mass Relay to fight the Collectors at the center of the Milky Way in Mass Effect 2, Shepard's greatest challenge still lies ahead.  Once considered the stuff of lore, the Reapers rear their heads in our own backyard. Having returned to the galaxy after a 50,000 year hiatus, the Reapers conduct an all-out assault on the galaxy's organic life. Earth itself suffers heavy bombardment as Mass Effect 3 begins, with millions suffering and dying daily. Your task: fight back, not only for Earth and humanity, but for all galactic races that find themselves simultaneously under siege. Shepard and his allies aren't nearly strong enough to combat the Reapers' planet-sacking death squads on their own. The earlier Mass Effect games focused on exploring the galaxy as you complete quests, building up your reputation and ultimately careening headlong into the endgame. Mass Effect 3 has all of that too, and it's all conducted through the lens of truly consequential, wide-ranging decision-making. This brings yet again an exceptionally plot-heavy slant to a series already deeply reliant on amazing story-telling. The Reapers pose an existential threat to life in the galaxy, forcing Shepard to navigate through tricky territory wrought with age-old grudges, conflicts and old-fashioned hatred in order to get all affected parties to work together. The Krogans hate the Salarians and Turians because of the Genophage, while the Quarians have waged war with their rogue machines, the Geth, for hundreds of years. Conflicts like this exist everywhere. The challenge before Shepard lies in his ability to get all of these races -- and many others -- allied in order to fight the Reapers as one united front. This represents the galaxy's only hope in defeating their overwhelmingly powerful adversaries. Accomplishing such feats of diplomacy resides at the heart of Mass Effect 3. Gone are the loyalty quests of Mass Effect 2; things aren't quite as personal this time around. Shepard must still make a staggering number of choices in conversation, and how he treats those around him heavily affects the game's outcome. He'll still make friends and enemies, have personal conversations and learn a great deal more about those he encounters. And the more time you spend speaking to others and exploring everyone's stories, the more you'll extract from the game. A fierce gunfight. But now, the galaxy's problems are greater, and Shepard must think bigger. By helping out individuals, militaries, governments and entire races, Shepard will collect War Assets and form a higher and higher level of Galactic Readiness. These will become integral to the success or failure of Mass Effect 3's endgame, and bring an entirely new slant to the series, one that's both welcome and fresh. On an individual character level, Paragons and Renegades still rule the day. There's little room for grey area, making Mass Effect 3 -- like its franchise predecessors -- worth playing at least twice. Better yet, characters can be imported from Mass Effect 2 (which in turn could be imported from the original Mass Effect on Xbox 360 and PC), giving you an even larger range of consequence, impressively widening the paradigm in which choices you made in the original two games come to bear upon the trilogy's finale. For those new to Mass Effect, the game will prompt you to make a character fresh if you don't import a save from Mass Effect 2, and will even ask you to make some important choices that will affect the game's outcome. But without understanding the full gravity of these choices by having played the original two games, Mass Effect 3 will certainly be a shallower, less fulfilling and more confusing endeavor. Consequently, playing Mass Effect 1 and 2 before playing Mass Effect 3 comes highly recommended. Shepard firing away on some foes. With an imported character or a freshly-rolled one, veterans of the Mass Effect franchise will find a game much more in-line with Mass Effect 2 than the original. While Mass Effect 2 radically changed the series in many important ways, Mass Effect 3 only mildly iterates on what made Mass Effect 2 so great. Some of this tinkering works well; scanning planets for minerals, for instance, has been almost entirely removed, much to the chagrin of nobody. Now, while all planets in known systems can be visited and studied, only some of the planets have something truly interesting to offer you. In other words, BioWare has done a nice job in not wasting your time beyond sucking you in to read the fictional write-ups of the planets in every known system. (And speaking of fiction, get ready for the irresistible rip curl of Mass Effect's amazing codex, which fleshes-out the series' lore in an unimaginably deep way.) But some changes aren't as positive. Mass Effect 3 totes a far looser side quest system that's less compelling and interesting than its predecessors'. It's easy to earn a bunch of side quests only by overhearing conversations in certain locations, with no real context as to what you're supposed to do. While the main quest is heavy on story and action and certainly fulfills in its own right, Mass Effect 3's slant on side quests feels wanting, making the 30 to 40 hours it takes to complete everything in the game just a little more arduous. BioWare has somewhat dumbed-down the RPG-centric nature of the series, but thankfully this down-scaling is totally optional. Mass Effect 3 still very much acts the part of action-RPG, but players will be given options to lessen the role-playing if you want to jump only into the action or story. Then again, BioWare has made Mass Effect 3 deeper in some ways, too, with features like enhanced weapon customization. So not all is lost. Mass Effect 2's third-person action returns with some minor changes and upgrades. Characters can still launch into a number of classes that rely on conventional weaponry, tech, biotics or any combination therein. Likewise, the squad members you meet -- some old, others new -- will fit into one or more of those categories. With a level cap of 60, it'll be hard for you to fully upgrade your character in Mass Effect 3 in one go, especially if you don't import from Mass Effect 2. But Mass Effect 3 does support a New Game+ mode once beaten that will let you beef-up your character to loftier heights. Taking cover from the incoming onslaught. In combat, minor changes are almost immediately evident. Shepard can now jump when prompted, roll around on the battlefield and perform other feats of pseudo-platforming that give Mass Effect 3 a somewhat different feel than Mass Effect 2. Mass Effect 3 also feels more vertical than its predecessors. Various maps will have more staircases and ladders than ever, giving you several levels from which to fight, forcing you to employ different strategies to survive against enemy onslaughts. Cover-based, run-and-gun action is still the name of the game, and overall, this setup works great. Weapons can be toggled through and powers selected with trigger-controlled radials, while AI controls your squad mates almost entirely, save issuing supplemental manual commands. And speaking of AI, enemies also fight smart for the most part. Foes appear to work together, employ flanking and cover tactics and care about self-preservation. This doesn't always prove to be true, of course -- nailing enemy AI behavior is often an imperfect art in game design -- but BioWare has done a nice job in holding your feet to the fire in any case. Few battles can be won without employing some tactical acumen of your own. For the very first time in a Mass Effect game, a multiplayer component has been concocted to complement the single-player experience. While Mass Effect 3 is still very much a single-player affair, an optional multiplayer suite -- one most closely aligned to Gears of War 3's Horde Mode, though not as good -- will give the game even more replay value. Purists need not worry; multiplayer isn't necessary to play in order to complete the single-player campaign. However, the two do interconnect should players want to explore that particular angle. And Achievement and Trophy hunters will find multiplayer necessary to play in order to get all of their virtual goodies.  Multiplayer itself proves to be quite fun, although it's held back somewhat by Mass Effect 3's more rigid and at times unforgiving mechanics. But even with only one mode consisting of six stages (pulled from the single-player game's N7 missions) and three enemy groups (pulled from the single-player game's primary antagonists), leveling up your characters, purchasing upgrades and generally playing around with up to three other people certainly satisfies. Mass Effect 3's multiplayer may not have been even remotely necessary, but it doesn't diminish the overall product. Quite the opposite, in fact. Aesthetically, Mass Effect 3 pleases with a mild graphical enhancement over Mass Effect 2, obvious enhancements that shine especially when compared to the original. Voice acting still sounds great for virtually all characters, and Mass Effect 3's soundtrack makes for great sonic accompaniment through both tender conversations and hectic battles alike. Expect to find some texture loading problems, framerate hitches and off lip-syncing from time to time, but these issues don't mar the experience too severely. It's worth noting, however, that on PS3 our Shepard fell through the map and got caught in the environment a couple of times, forcing us to restart. This didn't happen on our concurrent Xbox 360 playthroughs. Mass Effect 3 with Kinect feels innocuous enough, which means it works well. Adding the ability to fire off hands-free commands to your team, the mechanic offers responsive functionality without requiring you to shout at your television. Simply speak a command, and Kinect executes generally well, though occasionally stringing three power commands together yields mixed results. Take a common combo used against Shielded enemies for instance: combine Garrus' Concussive Shot to knock out shields, Liara's Stasis to freeze a foe, and Shepard's Biotic Charge to rush and melee. Done properly, this can eliminate armor and take down buffed out Centurions, Marauders, even Phantoms. When it works, you'll smile goofily, noticing the gameplay speed up handily without the need to camp in the power wheel. Mass Effect 3 on Wii U is, in most ways, virtually indistinguishable from its HD twins counterpart. The thing is, Mass Effect 3 is also a fish-out-of-water on Wii U because the games that preceded it in the series aren’t on the platform. They may one day be, but in the meantime, Mass Effect 3 on Wii U thrusts players into a story that, by that point in the series, is already two-thirds of the way told. To make up for that, this version of the game comes bundled with an interactive comic that lasts well over 20 minutes, explaining the intricacies and plot points of the first two games while letting players make choices along the way that will impact how Mass Effect 3 plays out. It’s not a perfect solution, but it’s the best solution possible in a situation like this. Play the game on your TV, or on Wii U&#Array;s GamePad. The GamePad adds some extra bells and whistles that are actually quite unique, however. In-game, you can see a map of the area you’re in, as well as enemy locations, which proves exceptionally useful. You can also see your team’s special moves and abilities. But the best GamePad-centric feature, is, of course, being able to play seamlessly on the GamePad itself. Online play also works well. Connectivity and matchmaking both functioned nicely during our test sessions. If you want to play Mass Effect 3 in its truest form, your best bet is the Xbox 360 or PC (and soon the PS3 as well, which is getting the original Mass Effect shortly). That’s the only chance to get the full, unhindered experience. But if Wii U is your only option and you’re okay missing out on most of the story, then by all means, have at it. At the end of the day, you have a simple series of questions to ask yourself when considering Mass Effect 3 on Wii U. Do you have an Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 or gaming PC? Is experiencing the entirety of a plot-centric trilogy’s story important to you? Is having access to all of the game’s DLC integral to your experience? If you answered yes to any of those questions, than this version of the game isn’t for you. If, however, you’ve never played a Mass Effect game and want to jump on in using your shiny new console, then Mass Effect 3: Special Edition is worthy of your time and money. Mass Effect 3 on its own is still easily one of the best games of the year – and some (like me) would argue that it’s the best game in the trilogy – and that hasn’t changed on Wii U. The only thing that’s changed is your access to the rest of the series.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/rabbids-land-review	 The Rabbids Land box art features 14 of the wide-eyed, buck-toothed Rabbids doing wacky things in an amusement park, all surrounding big, bubbly text exclaiming, “THE PERFECT PARTY GAME.” That’s a bold claim for a four-player game that really only supports two at a time. To Rabbids Land’s credit, it takes full advantage of the Wii U’s wide-ranging gimmicks, and with one player on the television and the other on the GamePad screen there’s an asynchronous element to each game. While one player steers a boat with the Wii remote, another blows into the GamePad’s microphone to push explosive penguins at their opponent. You use the Wii remote to run away from me, I chase you using the GamePad. Sometimes you’ll turn the GamePad vertical, flip the Wii remote sideways, tilt, waggle, or touch. Rabbids Land is all about creating different one-on-one interactions, leaving the other two players waiting for something interesting to happen to them. For those actually playing Rabbids, the mini-games are serviceable standards that amuse in the same way these games often do – they’re simple and empty.  You spend most of your time not playing Rabbids Land. In the odd case four friends interact together, it’s in a limited capacity such as three players betting whether or not another will answer a quiz question correctly. These are rare occurrences during the process of playing the Rabbids Land board game, which, like Mario Party, is the excuse for playing mini-games. It’s also an excuse for Indiana Jones and other pop culture references in an amusement park setting. Here, you’ll roll dice, move around a board, and try to collect trophies, whether that’s by sabotaging friends with traps or winning mini-games to earn your own. Rabbids Land suffers from the same issue party games like this often do: Watching your friends play a video board game isn’t fun at all. The slow-paced presentation of rolling dice and watching the Rabbids move to their space is agonizing. When it’s your turn to step up, there’s cheap thrills in rolling balls using the accelerometer or shouting at a friend where they need to be.  And this emphasizes Rabbids’ greatest problem: You spend most of your time not playing it. Even then, when you’re lucky enough to land on a mini-game square, the game itself is likely uninspired. Worse, mini-games open up in groups, leaving you to grind through the same games until more unlock. Rabbids Land doesn’t make much sense as a party game. It has little ambition and middle-of-the-road execution. Nothing about this mini-game compilation stands out above any of the others we’ve seen on Wii – or Nintendo 64, for that matter. Worst of all, it’s exclusionary and isolating for the majority of the players most of the time. So, no, this isn’t the perfect party game – it’s quite the opposite.
Taylor Cocke	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/tekken-tag-tournament-2-wii-u-edition-review	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of Tekken Tag Tournament 2, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review.   Chances are, you’ve likely been turned off by a fighting game in the past what with the thousands of combos to memorize, strategies to learn, and teams to experiment with. And most of them don’t particularly care if you are into their particular brand of brawling. Tekken Tag Tournament 2, however, attempts to be different. It wants you to learn how to play it. It wants you to spend countless hours mastering its timing, tooling around with its dozen of characters, and making it your own. There’s a slight problem, though: It doesn’t make any of that terribly easy. Players new to the Tekken universe will want to make their way directly to the Fight Lab to learn the Tekken Tag Tournament 2 basics. Acting as a tutorial of sorts (and a replacement to the traditional Story Mode), Fight Lab drops you into the role of the Combot, a creation of Violet Industries that can learn any Tekken fighter’s techniques and use them in training exercises. Each level of the Fight Lab mini-campaign is designed to teach the player how to pull off some of the Tag 2-specific fighting maneuvers like Binds or Tag Assaults. What’s more, it does it in a charming and often absurd manner, with levels filled with Power Ranger-looking combatants that toss pizzas and turn your head into a pig. Hell, one of the chapter bosses is a fat Ryu from Street Fighter. Silliness abounds.  Theoretically, a tutorial to teach newcomers how to get their martial arts on is a great idea. Fighting games are constantly struggling to bring new players into the fold, and a step-by-step set of interactive instructions could be a great way to do that. Problem is, Fight Lab teaches via the “trial by fire” method. Can’t regularly figure out the timing of the Bind into Team Assault? Too bad, you’re going to keep attempting it until you do. For those who already have experience with fighters, it’s a solid way to learn a few of Tekken’s intricacies. However, it is too demanding to serve as a proper newbie-friendly experience. Of course, once you get into the fighting itself, you’ll realize that Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is still Tekken. It’s still got all the perfectly solid fighting mechanics that you’ve come to know and love since the series’ inception in 1994. You’ll still be working on your air juggles, your one-two(-three-four-five-six) punches, your precision blocking, and throw breaks. If you’re a seasoned Tekken fan, you certainly will not be disappointed.  The biggest change to the Tekken series is the advent of the Tag Assault system. By bringing in your tagged out teammate while your opponent is in the air, you can lay down ridiculous air juggling combos that seemingly go on for minutes at a time. With dozens of characters playable, the Tag Assault combinations are damn near endless. I’ve got my apprehensions about how well Tag 2 is balanced, but all that will only shake out once it’s being played on a truly competitive level. Options are plentiful for those who decide to dedicate their fighting time to Tag 2. You’ve got your standard versus modes, your practice mode that allows for recording and uploading videos, and your Survival Mode. The netcode isn’t perfect, as I experienced a few slowdowns here and there, but they were few and far between. Those looking for a lengthy online experience will definitely run into hiccups, but hopefully the more egregious moments will be culled out by future patches. But perhaps the most fun I had with Tekken Tag Tournament 2 was with the Pair Play mode. Designed for four players, it allows each person to take the role of one character each, to be tagged in and out at their leisure. The end result is a group of folks screaming and shouting and laughing all at once while the party chaos ensues on screen. It’s a mode decidedly not designed for competitive play, but man is it a good time.  Even with an absolutely bonkers-huge roster, fights tend to get a little same-looking. Run into King enough and his weird leopard head becomes rote and slightly boring. That’s where the character customization options come in. Want Marshall Law to sport some hipster glasses? You got it. How about a Samurai haircut for the Russian fighter Dragunov? Done. The cosmetic items largely don’t change the way that fighters do their thing, but the options are great for dedicated players that want to make their favorite characters their own. Tekken Tag Tournament 2 Wii U isn't all that different from the game that dropped for PS3 and Xbox 360 back in September. In fact, everything that you got in the original release is right on disc. The main differences here are the addition of a few extra modes in Mushroom Battle, Tekken Ball, and Tekken Supporters. Oh, and a whole bunch of Nintendo-themed costumes. Ever wanted to watch a pair of bears fight in costumes from the Mario universe? Well, here's your chance. Remember Tekken Ball from Tekken 3? It's basically volleyball but instead of scoring points when the ball hits the ground, you do damage to your opponent. It's still just as simple and fun as it was in 1997, but with the joyful addition of being able to spike a ball into the face of Jin while he wears a full Link costume. The highlight of the additions, though, is Mushroom Battle. It works like this: You fight while Super, Poison, Big, and Golden Mushrooms float around the level. Grab one of the good ones, and you get bigger. Get caught with a Poison, and you shrink in size. Get too big, and your punches will constantly fly over the head of your opponent. But get too small and your kicks won't do any damage.  You won't see either of the new modes being played on a competitive level any time soon, but they are both fairly enjoyable little distractions from the highly technical brawling that the other modes feature. The biggest disappointment, however, is the lost potential in the Wii U controller. Outside of brawls, it can be used to read character background info or draw on their costumes. In combat, you'll be able to tap the screen to pull off certain combos and moves. It's fairly bare bones, and I couldn't help but feel like it could have been used for a lot more. Even simple menu navigation would have been a welcome addition. So, while the Wii U version of Tekken Tag Tournament 2 doesn't change up many of the problems that we had with its original release, it adds some more casual-friendly modes for the Nintendo crowd. If you've been holding out, it's the definitive version. But for those who've already picked it up elsewhere, don't worry about skipping out. With its gigantic roster, in-depth character customization options, and breadth of modes, Tekken Tag Tournament 2 is definitely a worthy addition to the franchise. That is, if you make it past some of the more frustrating and impenetrable aspects of the Tekken universe. As a way into the genre, it could certainly do a heck of a lot better. But once you’re in, it’s a perfectly solid experience in which brawling fans will find a lot to love."
Anthony Gallegos	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/call-of-duty-black-ops-2-wii-u-review	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of Call of Duty: Black Ops 2, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review.   What if Call of Duty was different? This appears to be the defining question informing the direction of developer Treyarch’s latest, Call of Duty: Black Ops II. While large portions of the design conform to the tenets established by prior iterations of the franchise, the unparalleled wealth of gameplay options and brilliant twists on the formula have shaped Black Ops II into the most ambitious and exciting Call of Duty ever made. It occasionally feels like the team might have strayed into territory they’re not quite masters of, but significant tweaks to the multiplayer loadout system, as well as the realization of player agency in the campaign, make this far more than “just another Call of Duty.” This is an evolution.  The campaign narrative jumps between various characters’ perspectives and also in time. The Cold War-era missions follows characters such as Alex Mason and Sgt. Frank Woods from the first Black Ops, while the 2025 missions follow Alex’s son, David. All of these soldiers’ fates are intertwined with the villain, Raul Menendez, and his organization Cordis Die. Menendez is the sort of villain you just can’t seem to kill and, consequently, who knows how to hold a grudge. Thing is, he’s not your typical, “I’m evil cause I do bad things,” bad guy. Menendez is a tragic character, a product of imperialist nations’ meddling during the Cold War and a survivor of some truly traumatic experiences. The story successfully casts Menendez in a light where I’m still not sure how I feel about him. At times I wanted him dead, while at others I felt like he had a right to want revenge. Hell, I even vacillate between agreeing with his end goals. Like the film Inglourious Basterds, Black Ops II becomes less about you and the “good” guys, and more about the motivations and perspective of the villain. The very fact that I’m still thinking about how the story played out -- something unprecedented in a Call of Duty campaign -- is a testament to the strength of the writing. A great narrative already makes Black Ops II stand out in the pantheon of Call of Duty campaigns, but where it really sets itself apart is the addition of player choice and consequence. Moments and devices that would otherwise seem irrelevant -- like whether you find all of the intel in a level or choose to shoot someone -- can come back to haunt you, hurt you or help you. Failing objectives might result in new or more challenging missions rather than a restart screen. It’s a brilliant riff on the traditional Call of Duty campaign design, and, combined with the additional cutscenes that flesh out the story, creates a narrative worth replaying just to see the wildly different moments and endings. Most importantly, choice makes you apart of what you play; it’s not just a story, it’s your story. I may not have found the ending of my first playthrough satisfying because terrible things happened, but I appreciated that it was a direct byproduct of my actions.  The effects of your choices are often evidenced in the new Strike Force missions, shorter objectives which give you control over a group of soldiers and various drones. Sometimes these objectives are a result of your decisions and performance, and they tend to have tangible effects on the outcome of your story. These tasks are worth playing because of their crucial role in the creation of your story, but the limited command controls make them less exciting. You can order your troops around the map from a strategic overhead view or via the usual first-person control, though neither is as tactical as intended. You can’t rally soldiers on your position, and your AI allies will rush to die. Each objective essentially comes down to ordering my troops to move from point to point as a huge group while I single-handedly save the mission by taking direct control and fight a horde of foes. The importance of Strike Force’s outcome adds tension and stress to the action, but the ineffective input and inept allies create an unnecessary challenge that compromises its potential success. Shooting is as fun and precise as ever, and alongside the abundance of gigantic explosions, vehicle missions and intense firefights, it feels like the closest thing most of us will ever get to starring in an action film. In that sense, Black Ops II is the classic Call of Duty formula at its best, with an important, defining difference: The emphasis on drone warfare, the exotic-but-grounded weaponry and the attention to detail in the believably high-tech signage and architecture makes Blacks Op II feel strikingly plausible even when it strays into non-historical settings. The team at Treyarch brings a bit of the multiplayer loadout flavor to the campaign as well. Before each mission you can now customize your character’s weapons (restrictions apply to make sure you’re not using a future weapon in the past, for instance), accessories and even give them perks. Every level also has challenges associated with it, and you can scope out the leaderboards to see how you stand up to your buddies. These are small details, but they’re important because they layer on another reason to replay the stages. If for some bizarre reason the narrative doesn’t grab you, then you still have lots of additional goals to try and achieve that are decidedly more “gamey.” While not as big of a departure in structure as Treyarch’s single-player, Black Ops II’s multiplayer dares to defy the modus operandi, and provides a number of new options and modes that make it more engrossing than what’s come before. Call of Duty has shaped the way other shooters present class and loadout designs for years, and Treyarch successfully redefines the standard with the Pick 10 system. The hook of Pick 10 comes from the ability to defy the loadout rules. Each attachment, weapon, grenade or perk counts as one of your ten points, and you can swap them out at will to create a huge number of combinations. Treyarch has also added in Wild Cards, which allow you to spend additional points to break even more rules, like equipping two primary weapons or up to six perks. Pick 10 allows the creation of the most specifically tuned classes in any shooter ever. You want to have a soldier with a pistol, four perks and two throwing axes? Do it. Maybe you want to snap three attachments to a LMG, ditching your grenades to give yourself additional perks or a badass secondary weapon for close quarters combat -- you can do that too. Pick 10 accomplishes something I didn’t even realize I wanted: For Create a Class to be as exciting and enticing as it was when I first popped in the original Modern Warfare. I don’t just experiment because I want to create a loadout perfectly tailored to a specific mode, but because it’s a genuinely fun and intuitive system to use.  A number of other smaller design tweaks highlight the clever design of class creation in Black Ops II. For instance perks now only affect your character, leaving it to the attachments system to affect your weapon. Thus if you want to do something like fast reload, which will make longtime players look for the Sleight of Hand perk, you’ll need to hook up your weapon with a fast clip attachment. The Kill Streak system has also been wisely replaced by Score Streaks, making every match less about how many kills and in what consecutive order you get them in, and more about doing whatever nets you the highest score. This accomplishes a majorly important feat: it makes every game less about your Kill / Death ratio. Sure, it still won’t keep people from obsessing over it, but if you want to get it higher you’re going to need to help with objectives. While I appreciate the rush that leveling up and unlocking items provides, it always felt strange to reward you with a stat reset after hitting the cap and Prestiging. Apparently some wise people at Treyarch agreed. Unlike previous games, after each of the 10 levels of Prestige you won’t have your stats reset, but instead continue your weapon experience and challenge progress and earn even more rewards. For starters you now get a token that allows you to unlock any item regardless of its level requirement, forever. In addition you also get a Prestige Token that nets you either an additional Create a Class slot, a refund on all unlock tokens you’ve spent during your progress to date, or the more traditional character wipe that resets all your stats. This completely changes my attitude towards Prestiging, and makes it something I actually want to do. As for modes, we get the time-tested classics TDM, CTF, Search and Destroy, etc., as well as some variations that keep multiplayer from feeling like a simple rehash. First there’s Hardpoint, a version of Halo’s Crazy King mode. You battle to capture specific points, holding them for as long as you can to rack up points. It’s not exactly original, but the way it focuses the fight around specific points stands as a perfect example of how new modes can make specific Score Streaks and loadouts more viable (Take the Defender Score Streak on Hardpoint, you can thank me later). Another excellent addition to multiplayer is the option for multi-team battles. Returning modes like Kill Confirmed are a lot more interesting with four teams of three, and this option breathes a bit of new life into modes we’ve all played to death. And of course you can still play these in four player local split-screen play, or take two people and go online.  For all the years Call of Duty’s been around, though, it’s never quite managed to make it easy for new players to get into the experience right out of the gate. You pretty much jumped in right after campaign and started the level grind alongside players who have the skill of cyborg ninjas, which isn’t exactly a fun introduction. Treyarch’s changed this in a couple of important ways with Black Ops II, though, starting with Combat Training. From levels 1-10, new Call of Duty players can join others in battles against bots. After 10 you can still fight bots, but you’ll only ever earn half the experience, ensuring no one uses this to level easily, but also keeping you from feeling forced to join public games to proceed. If all you ever want to do is smash bots with your buddies, you can create Custom games and fill them out with AI opponents, tweaking everything from the victory conditions to the player health to the amount of items and classes people can take in their loadouts. There’s also a number of Party Game options, which still net you experience, and allow you to change up multiplayer pacing with sillier game modes like Sticks and Stones (crossbows, throwing axes and ballistic knives only) and One in the Chamber (your gun has only one bullet until you score a kill). There’s simply more ways than ever to just have fun with Call of Duty’s multiplayer in Black Ops II. Treyarch’s also improved the competitive aspect of Call of Duty with the inclusion of the forwarding thinking League Play mode. League Play allows you and your friends to create teams, complete with a unique name and emblem, and hop into matches with everything unlocked right from the start. You simply play a few placement games to get matched up with similarly skilled teams, and then head out to see if you can earn your way to higher tiers. It’s a proven system that’s resulted in much fairer matches for strategy games like StarCraft II, and a welcome reprieve for those who want to skip the level grind entirely and just focus on tactics and skill building. People love to criticize the length of Call of Duty games, and if Black Ops II were only a campaign that might make sense, but this argument falls apart once you look at how much content is included. The legs of the franchise come not only from the single and multiplayer components, but, in the case of Black Ops II, from the increasingly robust and easy-to-use social features built right into the game. The Theater system was always really cool to me, but a bit too complicated for my tastes -- until now. You can still create films with a number of tailored shots, or you can just hit a single button and the game will automatically compile a decent highlight reel ready for easy upload to Elite. Elite’s engaging tools and slough of helpful and interesting info can provide useful insights about you and your friends performances, potentially improving your game, but it’s disappointing it’s still only available for PS3 and Xbox players.  Like the level creator in LittleBigPlanet, some of Black Ops II biggest multiplayer social features – namely, COD Casting and streaming – interest me more as a consumer than a creator. Whatever your preference, you can now shoutcast live matches in specific instances such as Custom Games for tournaments, getting a host of data about every player’s performance. You can also watch replays, utilizing the codcast controls to get additional features which should give people with home capture setups more options.* Or if you want to try your hand at streaming, you can do that too by syncing your YouTube account with Black Ops II. The quality and framerate of the stream isn’t the best, and it only works with League Play matches, but both streaming and COD Casting offer ways to connect with the community that despite their limitations feel ahead of their time and unlike anything else the competition brings to bear. Black Ops II’s Zombies mode is the deepest the franchise has seen, even if its “campaign” narrative is reliant on the self-imposed stories arising from your roaming, zombie-slaughtering adventures with three pals. The thing is, even if Tranzit doesn’t come together as a traditional campaign, it’s still a fun alternative to the otherwise serious CoD gameplay. The ridiculousness of the Zombies world is pervasive, and the constant banter between characters, the silly robotic bus driver or the horror movie camp that saturates every second keeps things light. Moreover it’s a lot of fun to do something cooperative in Call of Duty. Fighting off increasingly difficult waves of undead inspires a different sort of tension than anything else the series has to offer, and with Zombies, it’s just about goofing off and having some laughs rather than trying to be the best.  Tranzit offers not only a different pace from the rest of Black Ops II, but also rewards exploration with new mechanics, secrets and easter eggs that encourage you to try it over and over. It’s intentionally designed vague, leaving you to your own devices to find random objects to combine into machines or defensive items in the environment. Once you build them you’re given no explanation about how to use them. It’s a bit aggravating, sure, but when you stumble upon a solution it’s also really rewarding, especially when that knowledge is applied to your evolving Zombies routine Zombies mode is filled out with Survival mode and the new competitive Grief mode. Survival feels a bit hollow now that there’s the option to play in the larger Tranzit world, but it’s an alternative for people who’d rather just defend a single area and forgo all the exploration. Grief is another silly addition to zombies, pitting two teams against one another in an effort to see who can hold out the longest. You can’t directly harm one another, but you can stun them when they try to revive their buddies, or even throw meat at them to make them more attractive to the undead legions. Both Grief and Survival feel more like afterthoughts when compared to Tranzit, but they were fun distractions nonetheless, and, alongside custom game options, provide even more ways to lose hours and hours to Zombies. We played on 360 for review, but having spent time with the PC version we can safely say they're virtually identical. The PC version doesn't have Elite, but it does feature additional options that PC players expect such as remappable controls and advanced graphics settings. Essentially, what it comes to is this: pick up the version where you'll have the most friends to play, because long after the campaign is over you'll have hours of awesome multiplayer and zombies to dive into. The PS3 version got off to a rocky start, with console lock ups, issues where multiplayer games just wouldn't launch and a host of other infuriating problems. Thankfully, though, things seem to have cleared up after just a couple of days, with even more patches on the way to shore things up in the near future. At this point the PS3 version feels virtually identical to the 360, with only occasional texture pop in and framerate drops that ultimately don't detract from the overall experience. The GamePad really steals the show on Black Ops II Wii U. While you can play with a Wii remote and nunchuck, a classic controller or even the new Wii U Pro controller, the GamePad’s button layout feels closest to what you might expect coming from the 360 or PS3 versions. It also offers some touchscreen options in multiplayer that are sometimes useful, and completely optional to use. You can change your class without having to bring up the start screen, for instance, or call in Scorestreaks with on-screen buttons (less than ideal in an intense situation, but it is optional), or use the GamePad as your minimap regardless of what controller you’re using. Moreover it’s built-in screen offers functionality that no other platform has. Namely, the ability to play any portion of the game via SecondScreen gameplay. Black Ops 2 occasionally drops in frame-rate no matter how you play it, but both regular and SecondScreen gameplay function well enough that I never felt at a disadvantage or that it took away from the fun, even when playing the super speedy online multiplayer. Even cooler, you can play online split-screen multiplayer without having to actually split your screens. You can still play with two people on the same TV, or, thanks to some brilliant designers, use the GamePad as your second player’s screen. One additional caveat about Black Ops II on Wii U: Its multiplayer is every bit as fun as that on other platforms, but hardly anyone is playing right now. I could easily find games of Team Deathmatch, but finding games in other modes or in League Play is currently nigh impossible. The team at Treyarch could have played it safe and Black Ops II would have sold well, but instead they challenged assumptions and pushed the series forward in awesome new directions. It’ll be hard to return to a campaign where I don’t have the ability to shape it, and I simply can’t imagine going back to the old loadout system now that Pick 10 exists. Combined with the host of subtle and overt improvements to the array of other systems, the additions to make it more appealing to Esports, and the more fleshed out Zombies mode, this is not just a fantastic Call of Duty game, but one of the best shooters of the last decade."
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/20/assassins-creed-iii-wii-u-review	 If there’s one image that encapsulates the Assassin’s Creed series, it’s that of a hooded figure balancing atop some skyscraping parapet, looking down into the city below. It’s a snapshot that shows off a lot of what makes these games special – their incredible attention to detail, breath-taking verticality, fascinating architecture, unique historical settings - but it also represents their limitations. Assassin’s Creed games are easy to admire, but you often feel a bit distanced from them, too, held back from inhabiting these worlds as fully as you’d like to. You’ve always been on the outside looking in. Not so with Assassin’s Creed III, which hauls the series across the ocean into a new setting that’s absolutely bursting with things to do. It turns a fascinating section of history into a vast open-world playground, letting you conquer the rooftops, stalk the forests and sail the seas of revolutionary America and authoring a main storyline that puts you in the middle of some of the most important events of the period, like a fly on the wall of history. It’s all about enjoying the freedom of movement the game affords you and immersing yourself in its world, as well as setting up the set-piece assassinations that form the climax of each chapter. Where the storyline missions usually follow a pattern of gathering information, stalking and eventually killing a high-profile target (with the odd naval mission or large-scale battle thrown in for variety), outside of that you're free to do whatever you want: hunt for trinkets, clamber over the rooftops of New York in search of almanac pages, or pick fights with the Redcoats on behalf of the populace. There is a vast amount of content in this game, from liberating Boston and New York to building up a homestead on the frontier to sailing the high seas to just enjoying the outdoors and hunting wildlife. But perhaps because Assassin's Creed III is so huge, it can be pretty inconsistent. It attempts an astonishing amount, and doesn’t always succeed.  Assassin's Creed III follows hot-tempered Native American assassin Connor for almost his entire life, starting as a tree-climbing kid and growing from troubled young man to vengeful adult – but without wanting to spoil anything, he's not the only character you'll play. Connor's path often intersects with key moments in the American Revolution, putting him in the middle of the Battle of Bunker Hill for one spectacular mission. He finds himself fighting on the side of the Patriots for most of the game, but because he has enemies on both sides, his motivations for doing so has little to do with their battle for independence from the British crown. Connor isn't as straightforwardly charming as Assassin's Creed II's Ezio, and although writing is excellent for the most part, you never warm to Assassin’s Creed III’s heroes nor grow to resent its villains in quite the same way. It’s impossible to discuss exactly why this is without spoiling something of the game’s plot - which you definitely don’t want, as there are some great moments here. There will doubtless be a lot of discussion around this after the game makes its way into players’ hands, but what it really comes down to is that Connor often feels more like an errand boy than a freedom fighter; within the missions, Assassin’s Creed III can feel very scripted and dictatorial, fettering you with rigid objectives and punishing you harshly when you step outside their boundaries – chase sequences are particularly infuriating on this front. The game is often at its best outside of the story, when it leaves you to enjoy and inhabit its world.  Connor isn't as straightforwardly charming as Assassin's Creed II's Ezio, and although writing is excellent for the most part, you never warm to Assassin’s Creed III’s heroes nor grow to resent its villains in quite the same way.  As a technological achievement, Assassin’s Creed III is astounding. Its excellent opening in a London opera house is a showcase for the new and improved animation, crowd physics and freedom of movement, but as soon as you hit the New World it is all about the great outdoors. Assassin's Creed III's story spans decades and over that time you get to see the gorgeous forests and nascent cities of Connor's homeland covered in heavy snow, gleaming in autumnal morning mists, and blooming in the summer. It can be stunning. Walking the streets of bustling Boston, full of people and noise and activity, you can't help but be in awe. However, Assassin’s Creed III is often the victim of its own technological ambition. Pop-in, frame-rate drops and occasional graphical glitches are definitely a part of the experience, and you do wonder whether the omnipresent fog in New York City has more to do with technical limitations than the weather. The loading times are also hefty and I encountered some significant bugs during my review playthrough, though the developer claims that these will be fixed with a day-one patch. But it feels petty to begrudge the game for these hiccups when it pushes the boundaries of this generation so far.  The basics of Assassin’s Creed – free-running and combat – have been honed to near-perfection here. Free-running has been simplified and improved, and scaling the rock faces and branches of the frontier is no more difficult or confusing than climbing the ornate architecture of European cities. The Animus interface is clearer and less intrusive then before – spiderweb-like vectors highlight things that Connor can interact with and show when he’s hidden from view in the undergrowth or in a crowd. Every element of the HUD is customisable, letting you determine exactly how much visual help you want.  Assassin's Creed III is more combat-focussed than previous games in the series; there's a lot less leaping around ruined buildings and much more stalking and killing, of man and beast both.  Combat is still a fairly simplistic parry-and-counter system, but it's made much more exciting by some excellently gruesome kill animations and a big selection of weapons – although, weirdly, you have to visit a shop or the homestead mansion to swap out your swords, axes, tomahawks or clubs. But trying to remain hidden is much more satisfying than just causing a giant brawl – staying incognito during assassination missions is extremely challenging, usually for the right reasons. Assassin's Creed III is more combat-focussed than previous games in the series; there's a lot less leaping around ruined buildings and much more stalking and killing, of man and beast both. Multiplayer is an unexpected pleasure, placing the finely honed running-and-killing mechanics of the single-player game into an inventive and surprisingly cerebral new context. The new Wolf Pack mode, a co-operative score attack where you and friends work together to kill NPC targets, is superficially entertaining, but honestly it’s the familiar Assassinate mode that still holds the most appeal, getting you to identify and kill other human players amongst a crowd of NPCs whilst trying to remain hidden yourself. Playing the multiplayer unlocks an impressively fully-formed, branching story about the Animus and Abstergo that provides extra motivation to keep playing, but it’s the thrilling mixture of deception, quick-wittedness and sudden violence at the heart of most of the game modes that keeps it exciting. There’s a lot to it, so much so that it almost feels like an entirely separate game from the single-player. Assassin’s Creed III’s pacing is a source of frustration for the first third or so of the story – it takes too long to open up and show its hand. Right at the beginning of Connor's story you're kept on a short leash; your movements are wholly dictated by the plot for a good three hours or so, which is disappointing when you've had a taste of how open the world can be. It's a definite low point that lasts too long, and the game only really recovers when it sets you free again to explore at your own pace.  After that point, the minimap bristles with enticing icons, inviting you to join hunting clubs, explore with frontiersmen, recruit your own assassin underlings in New York and Boston by loosening the Templars’ grip on the cities, or take part in hours’ worth of optional naval missions that put you behind a ship’s wheel. How much you engage with all of this optional fun will determine how much you enjoy Assassin’s Creed 3 as a whole; stick to the story missions and you’ll quickly become frustrated with their strictures (and frequent cut-scenes), but allow yourself an hour or two of exploration between each of them and the game’s rhythm is much better. The naval missions, particularly, are a real highlight: they’re dramatic and novel, and the feeling of steering the ship against the ocean’s swell and battling through unfavourable winds is really convincing. But although Assassin’s Creed III’s variety and freedom is in many respects a saving grace, it’s also problematic: there’s a vast amount to do, but not all of it is integrated well. Where some optional stuff like the naval adventures, fort assaults and the Homestead side-story missions are great, other things feel unfinished, tacked-on or queerly pointless, like the Boston and New York underground tunnels, trading and crafting, and training your assassins once you’ve recruited them. These features aren’t fully realised and feel like wasted ideas. How much you enjoy the game will depend heavily on how willing you are to figure out and engage with these optional activities on your own, because the game won’t guide you towards them.  Playing Assassin's Creed III on Wii U's Game Pad is a tad disappointing -- it looks a bit low-res compared to other console ports. If you use the Game Pad as a support device, the helpful mini-map gives you a solid look at a large local space, identifying enemy, poster, and objective locations in your hands. Pressing the touch-screen to whistle for your horse means keeping two weapons in Connor's weapon slots, so that's a worthwhile convenience. Beyond that, Assassin's Creed III for Wii U is functionally identical to the original. Assassin's Creed III is very enjoyable overall, but it’s not consistently brilliant. Not everything about the game gels together convincingly and the missions’ unnecessary prescriptiveness sometimes undermines the sense of freedom that the rest of the game works so hard to create. But it achieves so much that you can’t help but respect it; no other open-world game has ever given us a setting that's as impressive to observe or as full of things to do as this. Connor’s story has its lulls but it still tells a tale much richer and more compelling than most other games manage, set in a fascinating period of history. Assassin’s Creed III isn’t as huge an improvement upon its predecessors’ achievements as many players will be hoping for, but it’s still up there with the best that the series has achieved - even if it isn't quite the best.
	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/20/nano-assault-neo-review	 There’s something especially shiny about Shin’en. Every game this studio puts out is so visually polished and beautiful – you just can’t look away from the graphics they’ve been able to achieve on Nintendo’s Wii and 3DS in titles like Jett Rocket, Art of Balance and Nano Assault. And now, with the Wii U’s high-definition capability in play, Shin’en’s latest release is their shiniest yet. Nano Assault Neo is an all-new sequel to the original Nano Assault, an under-the-radar hit that launched for the 3DS roughly one year ago. Like that first game, Neo once again puts you in the role of a pilot who’s been shrunken down to fly inside a human body. And, once there, it’s up to you to cleanse a series of cells from infection – by wildly blasting anything that moves to pieces with an overwhelmingly violent arsenal of lasers! This game is a visual spectacle. Truly, wonderfully stunning. Yes, Nano Assault Neo is a fast-paced twin-stick shooter that fans of that genre will adore. But it’s not just that – because its levels are free-floating 3D cells that you can travel across in any direction. Just like Super Mario Galaxy’s hovering planetoids, you can move all around these three-dimensional arenas hunting down viruses and creeping bacteria – using the GamePad’s left stick to move, and its right stick to aim your continuous laser blasts independently. It’s intense, gorgeous fun. You’re spinning around the surfaces of these cells slinging shots every which way, grabbing power-ups and credits to spend in the upgrade shop, trying to dodge all of the incoming fire these foes are sending your way at the same time – and it’s all playing out with such breathtaking visual quality that you might just need to stop and catch your breath for a minute after each level ends. Nano Assault Neo also includes bonus levels that play out like a cross between Star Fox 64’s tunnels, F-Zero GX’s hovercraft handling and Sonic the Hedgehog 2’s half-pipes, and every set of four stages is capped off with a boss battle at the end. There are leaderboards for sharing your high scores with the rest of the world and a two-player mode that lets a friend get into the action along with you. There’s the ability to play it all off the TV on just the GamePad screen if you choose, and separate Arcade and Survival modes to attack too. That’s quite a few features for a launch day download, and they round out what is a very attractive package for just 10 dollars. If there’s any drawback here, it’s in overall length – this is the kind of game that encourages replaying its set of stages again and again to go for higher scores, but that also means there aren’t a ton of levels total. Four sets of four stages apiece, for 16 total. 20, if you want to count the bonus levels used half-way through each quartet. Still, for just $9.99, getting that number of levels is getting more than your money’s worth. Shin’en is a studio that’s been steadily improving its efforts on Nintendo systems over the past several years. Over a decade, even, as you can trace this latest game’s roots all the way back to the Iridion series on the Game Boy Advance. Nano Assault Neo is their boldest, more beautiful shooter yet, and Wii U owners absolutely shouldn’t miss out on its shiny twin-stick shooting.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/19/nba-2k13-wii-u-review	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of NBA 2K13, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review.   Competition, according to free market economic principles, makes the dueling products better as each pushes to outdo the other. And thus, we consumers are the ultimate winners. But what if your chief – and really, only – rival kept finding new and astounding ways to spin out, leaving you as the only car on the road? Would you kick back, ease off the gas a bit, and set the cruise control? Would you keep the pedal to the metal anyway? Or would you drop the top, start turning down new streets, and see where the open road takes you? NBA 2K13 unquestionably takes the latter path, lacing the latest version of its annual basketball simulation with wild features that, rest assured, take nothing away from the already stellar pro-hoops gameplay. Some of the new additions are great, while others you can live without, but, in the end, 2K13 is the pinnacle of basketball gaming on this generation of consoles.   2K13 has the cajones to mess with its tried-and-true simulation gameplay a bit. The pacing, flow, and feel all remain impeccable. The post-up game is not only playable but enjoyable. The big change is the right thumbstick-based Dribble Stick, which marries the Freestyle controls of last generation’s NBA Live titles with the existing NBA 2K Isomotion control scheme. Shooting is now accomplished by pulling in ZL in combination with a right stick directional press. It certainly takes getting used to given the years of shooting without an additional trigger pull, and odds are you will, like me, occasionally forget and fail to take a wide open shot you meant to attempt. But you’ll eventually get used to it and grow to like the added dribble controls, as they’re not nearly as arcade-y as they were in NBA Live’s heyday, but still add an extra layer of player control to the gameplay. 2K13’s biggest problem – particularly with the Dribble Stick – is that none of its new features are explained well, if they’re explained at all. You’re never given a proper tutorial on the critical new dribble moves. Rather, the first time you start up the game, you’re treated to a screen that essentially says, “You can control your dribble with the right stick now. Wiggle it and see what happens!” So too are Signature Skills practically kept shrouded in secrecy unless you study the list of them in the main menu. ""Hi there."" Signature Skills assign star players up to several of a couple dozen “plus” traits, be it Corner Specialist (added accuracy when shooting threes from the corners), Finisher (better chance of making shots with defender contact), etc. Because they’re passive and mostly invisible, you probably won’t notice them unless you play MyCareer, where you’ll spend your VC points – credits earned for anything you do in the game – to add them to your budding pro baller. Speaking of which, the series’ interface continues to be an archaic, convoluted mess. Some menus can’t be backed out of, while save screens stupidly leave you at the save menu even after you’re done saving – rather than taking you back to a menu where you can actually do something. Better to enjoy 2K13’s commendable gameplay and suffer through a poorly designed interface than vice versa, but still, how many years has it been like this now?   Yes, I did in fact invoke Justin Bieber’s name in the context of a basketball video game review. And it’s not a joke. The teen pop star leads a 2K13 Celebrity team that includes JB Smoove, Bow Wow, and others. They’ve got a ridiculous 97 team rating, and so you can take the 1992 Dream Team – a glorious addition – head-on and give them a run for their money, as odd and completely impossible as that sounds.  Meanwhile, MyPlayer has taken on a slightly more personal, RPG-like role. It’s as engaging as last year, with your custom baller able to participate in a rookie game, get drafted (complete with a David Stern handshake at the podium), and develop your skills with experience. But now you can even request sit-downs with your general manager, in which you’re free to be good (i.e. compliment the organization) or evil (request that your coach be fired). Your choice of words can be hilarious, and depending on what you say, your standing amongst your teammates, the media, and the fans will be positively or negatively affected. Ah yes, and I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention Jay Z – particularly since his name is in large font on both the front of the box and the main menu title screen. The Brooklyn Nets owner is credited as the game’s executive producer, and, like Bieber, his presence is also not a joke. The soundtrack is of Hova’s choosing, and while I won’t go so far as to say it actively makes the game better, it certainly fits. What does make 2K13 legitimately better is Jay’s pre-game intro packages, which mix music videos with slick gameplay footage to get you hyped up. It works – these impressively produced segments lend each on-court match an added importance and enthusiasm.   The NBA 2K series is also slowly evolving into a virtual hoops museum, too. Not only are NBA Legends teams like Jordan’s dynasty-era Bulls, Magic’s Lakers, Bird’s Celtics, and now Iverson’s 2000 76ers in the game, but so too are both the 2012 gold medal-winning Team USA basketball squad and the original 1992 Dream Team. Even Charles Barkley – who hasn’t licensed his likeness to a video game since the Sega Genesis days – signed up. It’s an appealing inclusion, though it begs for a full-blown Olympic tournament mode for both the 1992 and 2012 Summer Games. Even if you ignore 2K13’s weird sideshows and look past its convoluted menus, its core beats with the heart of a champion. With such smooth, realistic gameplay held together by truly astounding presentation – meaning Jay Z’s intros, the series’ dead-on perfect animations, and note-perfect commentary – it’s hard not to love and appreciate NBA 2K13 if you have any affinity for pro basketball whatsoever. So what can you expect on the Wii U? Visually, it’s completely on-par with the already released Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. Feature parity is a plus, too, and it’s quite nice – as with most Wii U games – to be able to play on the Gamepad screen without the need to turn on your TV at all. The few Wii U-exclusive options are hardly worth double-dipping over if you’ve already bought it for another console, though, and odds are you won’t use them much regardless. Tilt the Wii U Gamepad towards you so that the screen is parallel to your body to activate the “Gatorade Biometric Scan™,” which gives you a Predator heat vision-esque look at the players on the court. The redder they are, the hotter they’re shooting, and the more empty their heat map, more fatigued they are (read: time to send them to the bench to rest). Tap on any player from this view to get a detailed look at each hoopster’s physical state. Finally, a tap to the upper right corner of the Gamepad screen brings up some quick coaching options, which only prove more convenient than using the D-pad if you happen to be playing off of the Gamepad screen to begin with. Otherwise, it’s not worth taking your eyes off the TV. It’s both scary and exciting to think how good a game we might get if NBA 2K actually had a serious competitor pushing it to new heights. But even when left with a clear, unobstructed path to the basket, 2K13 throws down a monster jam with this year’s edition – probably the last one developed solely for this generation of consoles. It’s obviously the best hoops game out there, and it might even be the best sports game of all, period."
Greg Miller	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	" There's a Catch-22 in ZombiU, and it's “survival.” Listing the things that ZombiU does well calls out the importance the game places on trying to survive, but focusing that spotlight on survival makes the game’s shortcomings all the more glaring. Hey, pretty lady. There's no real narrative to ZombiU, and that's fine. The game isn't trying to tell you the next great video game story, and some of its nonsensical points are actually its coolest. See, you start as a survivor in a subway station, a voice over the PA gives you your first mission, and you're off -- whacking zombies with a cricket bat, collecting samples and so on. The voice gives you missions, you unlock shortcuts and even run into some other characters, but the whole point of ZombiU is to survive for as long as you can. Because once you’re bitten, your character is dead. Literally. The survivor goes down and you respawn back at the subway station as a new character who somehow knows everything your old character knew and is ready to pick up the task at hand. Again, it makes no sense when you think about it, but it’s a really cool game mechanic for ZombiU. The title tracks how long each survivor has been alive and tallies a score based on your performance, so there's this metagame of trying to beat your best playthroughs, which are uploaded to the online leaderboards for the world to see. Even cooler, when one of your characters goes down, your next character has to trudge out to the spot of the previous character’s demise to bash the former you's zombie brains in and collect all the items they had looted and were carrying. It's like Demon's Souls. But with zombies and those British guards in the funny hats. If you’re super-hardcore, you can play through a mode where you have just one life to live. All of that’s cool, and that’s what sucks about ZombiU. The game has all these great ideas, but it doesn't have the gameplay or polish to back them up. Moving around in ZombiU, I felt like I was a camera on a Segway -- gliding across environments and making big wide turns. The levels are dark and spooky, but the game just doesn't look that good. Textures are blocky, zombies clip through walls, and there's nothing I can think of as a truly visually impressive moment in the game. But that's all superfluous compared to ZombiU's greatest flaw: combat. From the get-go, you have a cricket bat as your default weapon. It can't be broken, it doesn't need to be reloaded, and each survivor starts with it. During demos, the idea of creeping through the darkness only to come out and give a foe a good wallop seemed cool -- it didn't matter that it took a few hits to KO the ghoul. But that feeling wears off pretty quickly in the final version for ZombiU. Zombie after zombie takes multiple hits with the cricket bat to bring down. I’m talking about five or more whacks on the noggin to finally fell the foe and give me the chance for the killing blow. It gets to the point where it's just a chore to deal with them. I tried tapping the attack button, holding the hit button and aiming at different extremities, but there was no way to dispatch the undead quicker. Here's where we get to ""survival"" being a double-edged sword. I don't need ZombiU's combat to be over the top like Dead Island or Dead Rising; I enjoy the idea of this game being a slower foray that wants me to sneak past zombies and penalizes me for engaging the undead. But that's not the case here. He&#Array;s got the stink lines coming off of him and everything. Time after time, biters populated ZombiU hallways that I had to get through; they’d pop out of corridors I had to pass. Even using flares, which distract even the hungriest of the undead, only gets you so far. You have to fight in ZombiU, and the combat just isn't satisfying or fun. Part of this is ZombiU’s design. Zombies almost always come at you in manageable groups of two or three, so it feels like they're there to be engaged but still be beatable. Toss in the number of hits it takes to kill them, and zombie encounters often feel like they're just padding the game to make it longer. Of course, there are other weapons -- complete with a basic upgrade system -- like a shotgun and crossbow, but these make noise and ammo is limited. And that limited ammo brings us back to another great idea that's sunk by survival hiccups. When you kill a foe or stumble upon a filing cabinet, you can loot it. What this means in terms of gameplay is that your onscreen character drops to one knee to go through his or her backpack and you need to manage your inventory via the Wii U GamePad -- dragging and dropping items into you inventory.  The trouble is, ZombiU doesn’t do enough with this stuff. It's a brilliant idea. Suddenly, looting means letting your guard down to decide what you really need. As the game doesn't stop, you might get attacked by a biter you missed or just be creeped out. ZombiU does a bunch of Wii U GamePad stuff like this, from tapping an onscreen syringe to draw zombie goop to holding the Wii U GamePad and targeting cameras in an augmented reality game. Sure, some of its hokey and the low-def art for barricades and such on the pad aren't amazing, but it's a fun idea. The trouble is, ZombiU doesn’t do enough with this stuff. The majority of things I looted were already empty and a waste of time. You can only loot in very specific places, so the survival idea of scrounging through every trash at and box is never realized and breaks the zombie simulator vibe. If you’re looking for a multiplayer fix, ZombiU has another good idea that isn’t fleshed out all the way. Here one player uses the Wii U GamePad and another uses the Wiimote or Pro Controller.  The Wii U GamePad player gets to drop zombie troops into the level inhabited by the traditional player who is trying to survive or capture flags. I had fun playing, but there’s no denying the mode is shallow. It’s just three modes for two players with no online option. I’m sure some people will get really into the light strategy of it all and have epic fights, but most will pass this mode by without a second thought. ZombiU has so many great ideas from looting with the Wii U GamePad to permadeath to its spooky setting, but none of them grow into a great game. Controls are clunky, melee combat is annoying, and the game doesn’t look good. There’s fun to be had here as it’s challenging to see how long you can go before succumbing to a biter, but there are so many better zombie games out there that ZombiU really doesn’t demand anyone’s attention."
Greg Miller	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/batman-arkham-city-armored-edition-review	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of Batman: Arkham City, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review.   Sometimes reviewers can't see the forest for the trees. When I finished Batman: Arkham City, I immediately cataloged what I thought it did wrong. It tossed in too many villains and didn't flesh them out, it clearly tried to replicate the Scarecrow stuff from the first game and didn't do it as well, and Batman still moves a bit stiffly when simply walking around. When I formed the list, I found myself disappointed with the game. But the days rolled on and I couldn't stop playing -- in fact, I only wanted to play more. The hundreds of things Batman: Arkham City nails outweighed my nitpicky problems. I realized Batman: Arkham City is a brilliant game. If you've missed the roughly 1.4 million stories on IGN, Batman: Arkham City picks up months after the events of Asylum. Former Arkham warden Quincy Sharp now reigns as the mayor of Gotham City, and he's moved the bad guys from Blackgate Prison and the inmates from Arkham Asylum to a cordoned off area in the heart of Gotham. This is Arkham City, Dr. Hugo Strange runs it, and Batman's job is to see what the hell is going on inside. It's an interesting story that starts with one of the best openings in modern games. After two years of dreaming about where this sequel would go, Batman: Arkham City delivered and hooked me. That can be said for most of the game.  Fans of the Batman: Arkham Asylum will immediately be at home in Arkham City as developer Rocksteady took the core gameplay, refined it, and polished it. You brawl with one button, counter with another and leap when you feel like it. Batman's got a slew of new counter attacks -- including the ability to take out several attacking enemies at once -- and the ability to use nearly every gadget in battle with a hot key system. Even though the system can seem simple (that's if you ignore the combos and multipliers) the diversity in the attacks and battles keeps it interesting. I wanted to engage bad guys instead of sneaking past them. Maybe it was the promise of more experience points and the upgrades they unlocked, but it probably had more to do with wanting to see Batman dislocate another elbow.  I feel more like Batman than ever before. Rocksteady kept me on my toes by peppering in special enemies. Guys with stun rods, armored outfits and broken bottles all have to be dealt with in very specific ways. I needed to assess threats and engage situations like Batman would. I don't know if I can express how awesome that makes a comic nerd like me feel; after years of hypothesizing how Batman would beat Character X, I now have to do it to survive. Feeling like Batman made Arkham Asylum a must-play, and Arkham City continues that tradition. I felt like I had the upper hand when I walked into a room where the enemies outnumbered me 20 to 1 because I could drop a smoke pellet, use freeze grenades to take enemies out of the game and basically kick ass. Five gunmen with hostages didn't scare me because I knew I could disappear into the shadows to string them up from gargoyles, punch through walls to take them down and glide kick them over railings. This feeling of empowerment carries over to bosses, which is weird at first but makes sense. No boss in Arkham City really gave me a challenge. In fact, they're all a bit easy. Mr. Freeze had me stumped for a while as once you use an attack on him you can't use it again, but then the Bat-computer just sent me a cheat sheet. (Although, disabling hints would've eliminated this moment.) That specific instance was no fun, but overall, the joy of Batman bosses is the journey to them and not the fight themselves. The Penguin will never challenge the World's Greatest Detective. Arkham City isn't an open world like Liberty City; it's more like a hub world with a bunch of dungeons like The Legend of Zelda or a bigger version of Batman: Arkham Asylum. You can't go into every building, but as you explore, you're going to find you're kept from discovering some of the 400-some Riddler Challenges until you double back with new gadgets. As you unlock the game's dozen side missions, you have to search nooks and crannies for murder victims and political prisoners in distress.  If being Batman sounds good to you, expect to play this game twice and have the second time feel light years better than the first. New Game Plus unlocks after your first runthrough of Arkham City, and it carries over all your gadgets and shares your Riddler Challenge data. It also doesn't erase your original game's progress – it lives in its own section of your save. Historically, I despise playing games more than once. I know what's around the next corner, so where's the fun in it? Well, I adored Batman: Arkham City's New Game Plus. The difficulty is amped up, the enemies are more diverse from the get go, and the reversal indicators are turned off. New Game Plus takes the training wheels off and forces you to be Batman. When Batman enters a fight, he knows how to win; he just needs to execute his plan. That's you in this mode. You already know what's coming, you just need to execute your 45-hit combo, dodge explosives and save the day. This left me feeling more like Batman than ever before.  I had the upper hand when I walked into a room where the enemies outnumbered me 20 to 1. Challenges rooms return and have been given an update since the days of Arkham Asylum. There are a dozen combat challenge maps (take out the four waves of bad guys) and a dozen Invisible Predator challenges (sneak around and silently eliminate all the bad guys) and each comes with three medals to earn. All that is standard, but Arkham City offers up Riddler Campaigns. These link three challenges together and apply gameplay modifiers like low health, time limits and so on. There's even an option to make your own Bat-exams. These challenges mainly serve to point out how slow my version of Batman is, but I'm glad they're here. They help hone my skills and provide leaderboards to chase and keep me playing.  The four Catwoman story missions inserted throughout Batman: Arkham City are a fun (albeit simple) change of pace. This former downloadable content is now a natural, integrated part of Batman's story, and it expands the mythos of the game as you're playing it by changing perspectives to Selena Kyle to explain events that are happening off camera. Outside of the four missions, there are also has challenge maps for the feline and the ability to get the special Catwoman Riddler Trophies in Arkham City.  For those who played through Batman: Arkham City in 2011, the Armored Edition doesn't offer much in the way of incentives -- by and large, this is the same top-notch action/adventure game Rocksteady released last year. The new BAT mode gives you an additional combat option, but it's both unoriginal and ineffective. You'll charge a meter, activate BAT mode, and become mildly stronger in a fight. The inclusion of the Harley Quinn's Revenge expansion, Robin and Nightwing's challenge rooms, and character skins goes a long way to lengthen the experience, but the Wii U Game Pad functionality is clearly a consequence of launch-title experimentation. Arkham City looks and plays just as excellent as always on the Game Pad screen, but when it's used for touch-screen weapon selection, or as an in-game gadget, the Game Pad is just awkward. Moving the real-world object to look for in-game objects is a chore, and better left to the analog sticks. Glancing at the Game Pad to see your sonar radar is the best usage, really, but even then it's unexciting and not as helpful as simply absorbing yourself in the game proper. Batman: Arkham City isn't perfect, but listing the little things I didn't like gets in the way of all the stuff I adored. The voice acting, the challenges, the amazing opening, the unbelievable ending and the feeling of being the Dark Knight -- these are the things that standout looking back. I've beaten this thing twice and still want to call in sick and chase Riddler Trophies. Batman: Arkham City isn't just better than Batman: Arkham Asylum, it's better than most games on the market."
Audrey Drake	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	" EDITOR'S NOTE: For a rundown of the Wii U specific features of Darksiders II, scroll down to the ""Wii U Difference"" section at the bottom of the review.   Darksiders II represents the latest offering from developer Vigil Games, a direct follow-up to the 2010 original. Much like its predecessor, Darksiders II provides some solid action, albeit nestled amid a somewhat flawed experience. It’s also possibly the most derivative game ever made - borrowing adventure and puzzle elements from The Legend of Zelda, action from God of War, platforming from Prince of Persia, and tone from some hellfire version of Lord of the Rings. That’s not necessarily a bad thing - an amalgamation of such incredible franchises could have resulted in the game to end all games. The thing is, if you’re going to so blatantly derive material from such well-known properties, you better nail it. While Darksiders II provides a lengthy and entertaining experience for action adventure fans to sink their teeth into, in the end it never comes close to reaching the heights of the various franchises it so freely borrows from.  Darksiders II further fleshes out the story of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse introduced in the first title - this time with War’s brother, Death, at the helm. Death believes that War has been wrongfully convicted of destroying mankind, and seeks to restore humanity to clear his brother’s name. The narrative is pretty entertaining, if not severely overdramatic. Though it should please anyone solely in the market for ‘epic,’ it lacks any trace of subtlety and often comes off as sophomoric. Given that the end result of any plot advancement is inevitably that Death needs to gather three of something and thrash some skeletons, hearing the characters go on about the old ways and soul judgement just feels a bit silly. However, if a healthy dose of ridiculous doesn’t faze you, the contrived reasons for Death’s various escapades through heaven, hell and everywhere in between do provide an amusing backdrop for his quest. The majority of the adventure comprises rather standard action fare - Death wields both a fast primary weapon and a slow but powerful secondary weapon, and you chain together moves to slash your way through the various enemies.  There are also a few special abilities you gain along the way - like the ability to summon demon lords to do your bidding or to split your soul in two to solve dungeon puzzles. The action segments are enjoyable enough - inasmuch as it’s hard to make slicing up undead baddies unenjoyable. Still, it’s disappointing that most of the enemies require next to no strategy to overcome. When you do come across an enemy that requires strategy to best, the joy of slaying it is truly satisfying - but these occurrences are few and far between. Most of the time, the answer is just to wait for the enemy to make their move, dodge, then attack. It’s still fun, because dodging and attacking are fun things to do in an action game, but it does get irritatingly repetitive after several hours of the same old song and dance. One of the touted selling points of Darksiders II is that it’s far bigger than its predecessor - with a map that’s more than twice as big and a campaign that’s about three times longer than the original adventure. Unfortunately, in this case, bigger definitely isn’t better. The freedom Darksiders II offers is something to behold - you’re able to journey around huge areas as you please, slashing enemies and seeking out treasure and loot drops to your heart’s content. But the bloated environments are simply too barren and often devoid of anything interesting to do or see. Since so little is done to vary up the gameplay, the pacing drags and the length of the adventure feels more like a chore than a bonus. The main problem is that the bulk of the adventure is repetitive. While it’s completely possible to reuse game mechanics throughout a campaign and still keep it feeling fresh, Darksiders II doesn’t achieve this. You’ll find yourself climbing wooden ledges and pegs, setting off bombs, and rolling balls over and over again in exactly same way, instilling a gnawing sense of deja vu. If these mechanics were employed in varied and clever ways, that would be one thing - but they’re not. I found myself rarely challenged by any puzzle I came across, and was often astonished that I was once again expected to repeat the same menial task I had just completed in the previous dungeon, or even in the previous room. This is no place for a horse. On the bright side, Darksiders II does offer up some truly epic boss fights to vary up the repetition, ones that will put your skills to the test and are truly exciting to overcome. You’ll fight all kinds of epic demons - ones that can regenerate, ones that are about 100 times your size, and ones that are just plain brutal in their assault patterns. The bosses are one of the highlights of the experience, offering a glimpse of what Darksiders II could have been had the entire quest been as varied and balanced as these memorable battles.  As for gamers who don’t like fetch quests - this game is not for you. Seriously, the entire game is a fetch quest. All you do is run from area to area, fetching three of these, then three of these, then two of these, then three more of these with combat in between. As someone who honestly doesn’t mind a healthy dose of fetching in her games, Darksiders II still pushed my limits. You end up fetching so much and for so long that the majority of the game feels pretty pointless by the end. Can’t anyone in these various realms do their own errands, for crying out loud? In truth, the game would have benefitted from being a skosh smaller and a lot more focused. In this way, the original game beats its sequel, as a more linear adventure that keeps the action coming befits this franchise’s intense style of gameplay. After all, there is a limit to how long you can run through similar environments and solve similar puzzles in order to appease your bloodlust for smashing things with cool weapons. One of the game’s stronger elements is its art design and voice direction. It’s incredible that you can grow so fond of a main character who literally never emotes, as he’s wearing a skull mask for the entirety of the adventure. Death’s awesome voicework doesn't hurt either - hearing him growl at the Makers or deliver lines like, “This is no place for a Horse,” or “You find something for a change,” is inexplicably enjoyable. Even though he’s pretty impossible to relate to - being the embodiment of death and all - his design and presentation still do a great job of making him someone you want to see to his journey’s end. Despite its issues, Darksiders II is still a fun game. While too many of the environments in Darksiders II are shockingly similar, some of them are well thought out and epic to behold, as are many of the characters and enemies found within. Unfortunately, the graphics aren’t quite up to snuff with the current generation of hardware. Some of the textures are so pixilated they look like they belong on a Wii, such as the oft-used skull and bones pattern (which is alarmingly flat, and thereby entirely unconvincing). It’s a shame, as the mediocre graphics undermine the game’s inspired art design. The animations are also quite choppy, as the game suffers from some fairly frequent framerate issues. There’s rarely enough happening onscreen to justify these MMO-like graphics. It looks good enough that it usually won’t distract from the adventure, but compared to similar games like God of War 3, the graphical presentation of Darksiders II is subpar. A frustrating detractor to Darksiders II is the sheer amount of random glitches you’ll encounter along the way - ones that can’t be accounted for and appear and disappear for seemingly no reason at all. Seeing Death floating above the ground or over thin air is not uncommon, nor is pressing B to perform an action command only for nothing to happen until a few button presses later. Other random glitches I encountered include the inability to discard boots, ally AI that just stands in the corner staring at the wall, a Primary Quest icon that leads you in the wrong direction (then shift positions when you check the in-menu map), and an absence of music and sound effects until the game was reset - and that’s just to name a few. Most of these glitches only last for a short while, then disappear never to surface again. Others, like a targeting system that rarely seems to target the closest enemy or a camera that is often pointing in an inopportune direction, are quite persistent. Sadly, they’re things you’ll just have to learn to cope with if you hope to see Death’s journey to its conclusion. The funny thing is, despite its lengthy list of flaws and failures, Darksiders II still manages to offer an enjoyable experience. Despite its lack of variety, the combat is still satisfying to engage in, especially when you run across a behemoth of a boss. And even though there’s not enough to do in them, running around such huge environments is still incredible. Certain abilities you amass along the way - like the Deathgrip or the summoning ability - are terribly fun to play with, and make for some really cool dungeon moments (like dashing across a wall and Deathgripping at the last moment to reach the other side). It’s also worth noting that the game picks up considerably towards the end, finally finding its stride for the last few dungeons. The puzzles get more creative, the enemies and environments more varied - it’s just a shame it takes about 30 or so hours to get to this point. Possibly the best part of the adventure, something that all action RPG games could learn from, is its implementation of RPG elements such as equipment and customization. Weapons found on the field can be instantly equipped or sent to your inventory with a single button press. Furthermore, each piece of equipment’s stats are displayed when you walk near it, as well as how it will raise or lower your own stats should you equip it. This makes fast decision making a breeze, and greatly increases the joy of seeking out the best armor to equip Death with. Every weapon or bit of armor you equip also changes Death’s appearance, which is a cool touch in making character customization feel more personal. The concept of cursed artillery, which you can ‘feed’ other items to, is also a great way to make the underpowered loot you come across feel like less of a waste. The way equipment is handled in Darksiders II is a true revolution in RPG gameplay, and one of the most solid parts of the experience. Tapping the left stick for Death’s bird, Dust, to show you the general direction you should go, and the deeply engrained Fast Travel system (which lets you instantly warp back to certain areas on the fly) are also great innovations for the genre. It’s a true shame the game’s impressive contributions are so severely undermined by its sheer amount of flaws and glitches. If you’ve already played Darksiders II on PS3, Xbox 360 or PC, there’s really no need to pick it up again. The Wii U version is a fairly straightforward port, one that looks and runs the same as the original. It’s essentially the exact same game experience, albeit with a few keys differences - differences that make this version a great value for anyone who missed the game the first time around. To start, the Wii U version includes the Argul’s Tomb DLC that was sold separately with the other versions, as well as the Death Rides, Angel of Death, Shadow of Death and Deadly Despair Packs. You can play using either the Wii U GamePad or the more traditional Pro controller. Both are great options, though using the GamePad for a game like this takes some getting used to. The adjustment period is mercifully brief, though, and the GamePad is quite ergonomic and more than competent once you’ve adapted. Being able to access maps and menus and to equip items on the fly with the touchscreen is a cool addition, but doesn’t significantly affect the overall experience. You can also shake the GamePad to dodge if you so please, though you can opt to use the roll button instead, or even disable motion controls all together. It works better than you would think, but most gamers will probably prefer to just use a button. These additions aside, Darksiders II is very much the same game. I did find it was a bit glitchy when I first tried playing exclusively on the GamePad screen. In fact, when I first tested this feature the action was successfully moved to the GamePad but I lost control of Death and had to reboot twice. Every other time it worked flawlessly, though, so this random glitch likely won't effect most players. Despite its problems, I was compelled onward in my quest with Death because Darksiders II is simply a fun game. The RPG elements and to-the-point action all make for some solid gaming, glitches and all. It’s a shame so many glaring issues hold such an ambitious endeavor back from the greatness its developers were clearly aiming for. Still, if you love action adventure games, it’s certainly worth checking out - but don’t expect it to rival the masterpieces it will inevitably call to mind."
Brian Altano	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/16/scribblenauts-unlimited-review	 A witch asked me to help her stop two pesky children from eating her house so I made it rotten and they ran away in disgust. An arsonist pleaded with me in desperation as his crippling penchant for destruction was ruining the world around him, so I gave him a therapist and they talked until he put his bad habits to rest. A lowly street peddler wept at his inability to make his way in the cold world around him so I introduced him to a teacher who taught him skills and inspired him to enter a life of gainful employment. A giant human heart began attacking a group of unsuspecting people so I threw some aspirin at it since that’s a great way to prevent those types of things from happening in real life, I suppose. In a few short breaths I’m a social worker, a baker, a doctor, a warrior, a savior of cities, and an inspirer of worlds. Flowers grow, birds flutter overhead, and newly remodeled buildings shimmer as jubilant citizens surround it with glee. And then I unleashed a giant Minotaur holding a chainsaw upon them all, because f*ck it. Scribblenauts Unlimited might be gaming’s greatest toy box. Its Super Mario Paint meets Grand Theft Auto and whatever else your warped little mind decides to splash across its blank canvases at any given instant. It’s a driven collection of hundreds of puzzles set in a sprawling open world spanning dozens of themes. It’s a game where nearly every single word you tap out on the Wii U’s touch screen becomes an object you can interact with on the fly. And it’s a wonderful little bundle of joy.   The premise here is roughly the same elevator pitch we got back in 2009 with the original Scribblenauts, just with a bounty of added control tweaks and minor nuances added to smooth out the process. Type a word and a cartoon representation of that word appears on screen as something you can interact with. Add an attribute to that word and you can interact with it further. A character asks for a friend. You give him a gorilla. Or a giant gorilla. Or a dead gorilla, if you’re feeling morbid. Voila. A Mario World inspired overworld connects lots of little puzzle hubs, meaning you can hop around and tackle everything the game has to offer instead of being trapped in the linearity of the “finish a puzzle to start the next” sequential progression of the last few Scribblenauts titles. And aside from a few small snags, it works very well. Old Scribblenauts’ standbys still seem to rule over anything much more elaborate that your brain may conjure, though. A sleeping pill will incapacitate any man or animal that needs to be put down without death. A black hole does a better job at clearing away waste than a broom ever could. And invoking a deadly cartoon laser gun battle between God and Satan on a total whim never gets old. All in all the puzzles feel a bit easier and simpler this go around. But it’s the rapid fire nature in which Unlimited presents each challenge (and the myriad ways to solve them) that really sets the experience apart from its previous iterations. Coupled with the nearly infinite combination of pretty much every non-nude, non-alcoholic and non-licensed noun you can summon and Unlimited nearly lives up to its name. Reunited. It’s ironically in the few licensed characters in Scribblenauts where things are actually much more limited than they should be, however. Nintendo handed developer 5th Cell the rights to a select few characters and items from the much-cherished Mario and Zelda franchises, and the results are equally brilliant and frustrating. On one hand, dropping Luigi and Windwaker’s Ganondorf into a pit with Cthulhu, a sheep and half a dozen zombies just to see what happens is a crazy thing to say that you legally created in an officially sanctioned video game sold in stores. Feeding Mario a Super Mushroom makes him double in size. Giving Link an Ocarina makes him call upon Epona. Summoning both Sheik and Zelda always makes one of them vanish. And yes, you can kill a chimpanzee with a Master Sword. Stop asking. But the ability to edit and customize objects and characters – something you can do with literally every other item in the game – is locked out of being possible for Nintendo’s branded characters. You won’t see any Yoshis with gigantic heads, cyborg legs and sharks for arms like you can with the non-licensed characters in Scribblenauts. Same goes for adding adjectives to the Big N’s canon. You can’t, which means no Chocolate Zelda or Bacteriologic Peach, sadly. It feels strange to run into licensing walls in what really boils to a God game, as innocuous as it may appear on its surface. Protect ya neck. Seeing Scribblenauts play out on a massive television is an alluring if not completely dismissible experience. You’ll want to marvel at how pretty this game is in high definition but the reality is that you’ll spend most of your time hunched over the Wii U’s GamePad, tapping characters and words with the stylus with barely a reason to ever look up from it. Your TV here only replicates the exact experience happening on the smaller screen so be prepared to get comfy with the GamePad here. As excited as I was to see things jump to high definition, Scribblenauts started as a handheld game and Unlimited does more to extend that experience rather than separate itself from it. In some ways, Scribblenauts Unlimited is still running on the same awe-inspiring gimmicks the series introduced in 2009 but with the level of polish and refinement here, it’s finally delivering on all fronts. Despite some dips in overall puzzle difficulty this time around, the game has a massive amount of content to both discover and create from scratch. If you’ve skipped the series until now, start here. You’ll be floored at how much there is to show off. And if you’re the creative type, the Object Editor opens up endless possibilities. Scribblenauts Unlimited is an excellent Wii U launch game, even if it just feels like a glorified handheld title.
Richard George	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/15/new-super-mario-bros-u-review	 While Nintendo has returned to the concept of a 2D Mario time and time again in recent years, none of these retro revivals have recaptured the quality of their predecessors. Rather than developing proper evolutions of Super Mario Bros. 3 and Super Mario World, the New Mario series watered down successful formulas to the point where it was good, but not nearly as great as its legacy. In other words, the brilliance of the NES and SNES formulas has eluded Nintendo’s modern teams. New Super Mario Bros. U changes that pattern. Though it doesn’t necessarily redefine Nintendo’s iconic hero, it still manages to capture the sense of carefree adventure that many of us felt as kids. More importantly, the game contains a significant amount of challenge, both within its story mode and outside of it. This game has clearly been designed by a team that regards Super Mario World with as much affection as those of us who grew up with it. Were it not for the game’s weak graphics and audio, plus the return of the irritating chaotic, bouncy multiplayer mode, this game might rival some of Nintendo’s better 2D accomplishments.  For many of us, Super Mario World shifted the Mushroom Kingdom from numbered, sequential stages to something more organic. The term “world” never felt more appropriate. New Super Mario Bros. U is the first 2D Mario game not only to return to that approach, but to take it subtly to the next level. The vast, seamless overworld not only houses the requisite levels, fortresses and castles, but also features items that can be picked up off the ground, roaming enemies that must be defeated, secrets, alternate paths and even some boss fights that occur within their own context, outside of any platforming sequence. Why Nintendo ever moved away from this approach seems even more baffling now that it’s returned. The imaginative approach to the overworld is just the beginning of the great design housed in New Mario U. The game starts off slow; some of the earliest stages are so simplistic you’d be forgiven for assuming nothing greater lies ahead. Yet the game continues to escalate in complexity, with layouts that beg for exploration, numerous hidden secrets and an overworld that subtly updates as you progress through the game. New enemies, power-ups and threats continuously introduce themselves along classic ideas in a perfect balance that will call back to old NES and SNES adventures while still feeling fresh. The level of difficulty feels just right, allowing you to keep moving at a reasonable pace while killing you plenty of times along the way. You’ll never run out of lives, but if you’re anything like me, you’ll still lose enough of them to feel like you’re being challenged. If that wasn’t enough, collecting all of the game’s Star Coins will certainly push your skills – and there is definitely a reward to doing so. Finding this balance haunted New Mario games in the past. None of them have been particularly challenging. None of them felt like they were anything but a routine trip back into 2D Mario, tamed to appeal to all audiences without regard for players that wanted a test of their skills. What’s more impressive about Mario U is that while its Story Mode does serve up some of that challenge, Nintendo opted to do even more. They created an independent challenge mode. And it will kick your ass. Challenge Mode shatters the traditional Mario experience, and will truly test a player’s resolve and ability. It places you on narrow platforms with enemies hurling projectiles at you, simply seeing how long you can survive. It forces you to traverse an entire level without killing an enemy – or perhaps not touching the ground. That even some of the simplest tasks will cause you to throw down your controller in frustration – and then immediately pick it back up to try again – is precisely what the Mario series has needed. In some respects it overshadows the Story Mode, and it’d be interesting to see if Nintendo can find a way to work more unconventional ideas like these into its main adventure. The diversity would be more than welcome.  New Super Mario Bros. U does have two critical technical flaws. Its visual and audio designs aren’t nearly as bold as its contemporaries, merely reaching the bare minimum of expectations for a HD Mario title. Wii U is a powerful system, and should be more than able to create a stunning platformer with layers upon layers of depth, great lighting and particle effects, and another world-class soundtrack. Mario U feels like it’s just achieving the minimum in any of those areas. The improvements from New Mario on Wii surface immediately, but that’s not nearly enough in an era where Rayman Legends also exists. Mario U features moments of graphical brilliance – particularly in later worlds and a the sublime level featuring Van Gogh’s ‘Starry Night’ – but they only serve to reinforce that difference. This isn’t a bad looking game. It just fails to be memorable. The same applies to sound, where much of the game’s music feels like a retread of the past. Familiar Mario themes are certainly present, and they’re as good as always, but the routine, generic ‘New Mario’ theme is back as well – the one that features the emphasized beats that cause Koopas and Goombas to briefly stop mid-step and dance. Much like the visuals, nothing here is outright bad. It just doesn’t reach the standard set by its predecessors. Considering some of the brilliance contained in recent 3D Mario games, it’s frustrating to see Nintendo not attempt the same here. Mario games are known for their music. That should always be the case. Wii brought multiplayer to the Mushroom Kingdom, but many players were put off by the chaotic four-player format. The same problems apply here, as so many characters attempting to leap and run through an environment simply leads to more deaths, not more fun. And there’s certainly no reason to have more than one player present – everything is achievable alone. Adding a fifth participant in the form of someone who can place blocks with the GamePad doesn’t help either. Players still ricochet off each other like pinballs, and deaths and power-ups still momentarily pause the action for everyone. Families and friends might enjoy the madness for brief moments, but if at any time anyone is actually trying to accomplish something, playing with others isn’t really a suitable option. It’s difficult to find freshness or brilliance in a 2D landscape. Mario’s world is now three decades old. That would seem to suggest new territory is scarce, and in some ways the formulaic New Mario series had come to reinforce that fear. But New Super Mario Bros. U demonstrates there’s not just life left in this type of game, but that it can be modern and nostalgic at the same time. Nintendo’s approach here strikes a great balance in all areas, ranging from its difficulty to design to enemies and bosses. And for everything the basic Story Mode does right – and that’s a considerable amount – the Challenge Mode will be remembered as a key moment in the life of the New Mario series, where Nintendo realized it didn’t have to sacrifice the core gamer’s experience at the expense of a more casual audience. This is how Mario can and will appeal to everyone.
Audrey Drake	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/15/nintendo-land-review	 Following the example of Wii Sports (the Wii pack-in that introduced the world to motion controls while cementing the console as a must-have party accessory), Nintendo Land is being propped up as the Second Coming of mini-games. It remains to be seen whether Land will have the same effect for Wii U that Sports did for Wii. What really matters, though, is that the game is exceptionally fun, and a fitting show of what tablet gaming on a home console is all about. A premiere example of a mini-game collection, what Nintendo Land achieves in terms of depth and variety is quite exceptional. It presents 12 different attractions, each with its own unique stages or modes and each anchored around a particular Nintendo franchise - from mainstays like Mario, Zelda and Donkey Kong to more niche offerings like Balloon Fight, Pikmin and F-Zero. What brings all these quite varied franchises and distinct gameplay designs into one cohesive whole is the theme park motif that ties it all together, which serves as the crux of the entire experience.  Using your Mii, you’ll spend your time exploring the main hub area (called the Plaza) and sampling the various games scattered throughout - all in the company of a hilarious robot named Monita who acts as your impassive guide. From the Plaza you can access the attractions, behold the various park decorations you’ve won in the supplementary Coin Game and run circles around your park guests (ranging from generic Miis to your Miiverse friends). The theme is effective, and so much more personal and interactive than just having a mini-game menu to scroll through. The Miis also add a ton of personality and a sense of continuity often lacking in mini-game collections. Since progress is tied to whatever Mii you’re playing with, even people who are sharing a system don’t have to worry about losing their high scores or having their stats messed with. All this lends to the feeling that you really are continuing your little adventure every time you turn the game on. The attractions themselves offer ample variety and are ridiculously, unabashedly entertaining. Every play session I’ve had, no matter the size of the group, always resulted in an eruption of laughter and good times. The remarkable thing is that Nintendo Land is riotously fun whether you’re playing alone, with a partner or with a group. This is a huge achievement, especially since most mini-game collections are basically worthless unless you have friends over. Nine of the 12 attractions can be played all by yourself, six can be played with up to five players, and all of them can be played competitively via the Attraction Tour (which allows you to play a random selection of games for a set amount of time). The multiplayer-centric attractions all essentially hinge on the idea of one GamePad user interacting with the game in a different way than the other players (all using Wii remotes). This asymmetric gameplay offers a clever way to shakeup the normal multiplayer routine. Combining the ease of using a touch tablet with gyroscope controls and an additional screen feels really fresh, and is something that’s simply never been done before. It’s also quite impressive how Nintendo Land alters the gameplay of certain attractions depending on how many players are present, ensuring a fun and reasonably fair time for all. Mario Chase, for example, adjusts for two player games by giving the pursuer a couple of Yoshi robots and Monita’s assistance to track down their GamePad-wielding friend. This makes what would otherwise be an unfair and probably frustrating experience much more balanced. It’s refreshing to see a mini-game collection go to such lengths to ensure the game can be enjoyed no matter the size of the party, and this is definitely one of Land’s greatest strengths. Each attraction shows off the GamePad’s potential in a different way, and several are shockingly deep experiences. Metroid Blast, for example, has three modes and dozens of levels where you shoot down enemies and your friends alike, and Pikmin Adventure is a self-contained, cooperative strategy game where you maneuver a team of Pikmin through multiple chapters and several boss fights. The Legend of Zelda: Battle Quest has you fighting your way through different areas of Hyrule, with the GamePad user acting as an archer and the Wii remote players wielding motion-controlled swords. All three of these games can be played cooperatively or alone, and have far more depth than you have any right to expect from a mini-game collection. Behold the glory of HD Metroid! Well, sort of. Those games alone offer hours of content, but they only represent a third of what Nintendo Land has to offer. There are also the “chase” games - Mario Chase, Animal Crossing: Sweet Day and Luigi’s Ghost Mansion - which all essentially have one or more people being chased by one or more other people. They’re similar, but subtly different enough to still feel like distinct experiences. Other games, like Yoshi’s Fruit Cart, challenge you with reconciling what you see on the GamePad with what’s pictured on the television, trying to draw out a course for Yoshi to follow to collect all of his fruit. Donkey Kong’s Crash Course uses the Pad’s gyro to let you control a fragile cart through a long and winding level. Balloon Trip Breeze has your consulting both the GamePad and the television screen to collect balloons and dodge obstacles for as long as you can. Each uses the GamePad differently, but all are addicting in their own way and offer some insight into what the system and its tablet controller are capable of. While the look of Nintendo Land is intentionally simple, everything is remarkably crisp thanks to the HD graphics. The world is all smooth edges and shiny finishes, and while graphics don’t make much of a difference in a mini-game collection to begin with, having such a sharp and colorful hub world to run around is still much appreciated. The music is also delightful, featuring a mix of new tunes and remixed tracks from the various franchises represented. Nintendo Land is a brilliant show of what Nintendo’s new console and tablet controller are capable of, and has far more depth and content then you’d expect from a mini-game collection. The attractions are ridiculously fun and offer plenty of variety, whether you’re flying solo or entertaining a group. Throw in high scores to best, gold trophies to earn, stamp achievements to collect and tons of Plaza decorations to unlock, and what you’ve got is an experience that must not be missed, and probably the best show of Wii U available at launch.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/13/ninja-gaiden-3-razors-edge-review	 Much has changed since you may have read some unkind things about Ninja Gaiden 3 earlier this year. In fact, it’s not even fair to call the refurbished Razor’s Edge a “director’s cut.” Rather, it’s more like a film that’s been screen-tested, made changes based on lots of negative feedback, and then released in a significantly different form than it was originally shown. Of course, that makes Xbox and PS3 owners akin to screen-testers who paid $60 for the privilege, but that’s another matter. Regardless of whether you’re coming to Razor’s Edge as a Ninja Gaiden neophyte or a series veteran looking for this franchise to redeem itself, you’ve come to the right place. Ninja badass Ryu Hyabusa has slain countless rivals and demons in his day, and that is the foundation of NG3’s gameplay. Lightning-quick moves define Ryu, be it with his trusty Dragon Sword or one of the other equally brutal weapons, such as the slicing, dicing Wolverine-esque claws or the slow-but-punishing Scythe, that you unlock over the course of the campaign. Each weapon has its own unique moves purchased with Karma points, which adds a lot of welcome variety to a game that was originally about cutting millions of guys over and over with the same single weapon and the same batch of moves. Doing well in each battle –stringing together combos without being hit, quickly finishing off batches of bad guys – earns you the Karma cash, which is tracked in real-time on the left side of the screen during each fight. It’s a bold move for an action game to say to the player, “Hey, I’m watching you. Impress me.” Bosses have been beefed up for Razor&#Array;s Edge. Bring your A-game...or else. Razor’s Edge’s pure-action gameplay will certainly impress you. The long odds stacked against Ryu in nearly every situation only serve to make you feel unstoppable as you tear through the opposition, while the scores of gore effects – be it arterial sprays or severed limbs – make each encounter all the more theatrically impressive to your eye. Though the pace of combat is much smoother and faster than the first NG3 release, some moves are still glorified Quick-Time Events, and frustration abounds when Ryu doesn’t snap out of an action as fast as it seems like he should. The addition of Ayane certainly doesn’t hurt the game. The crossover cameo from developer Team Ninja’s Dead or Alive brawler series lets you lace up the leather bustier of Ryu’s equally skilled colleague. She gets her own missions in Razor’s Edge, and her faster, nimbler play style serves as both a complement and a refreshing break from Ryu’s mainline quest. Ayane&#Array;s missions serve as a nice complement to the core Ryu action. No matter who you’re in control of, however, Razor’s Edge is going to hurt you, badly and often. The Ninja Gaiden series has never been for the faint of heart, and players familiar with the original NG3 release will find that the game’s sadistic sense has been restored on the Wii U. Bosses have had their cojones digitally restored, to the point that you should expect to get stuck on some of them for extended amounts of time (between 30 and 60 minutes at the worst, in my experience). Heck, even the regular minions start to get soul-crushingly challenging when the zombies and demons show up about halfway through the campaign. I can almost guarantee you’re going to want to hurl your controller across the room at times; a masochistic tilt has always been an unstated requirement to enjoy this series. Speaking of controllers, Razor’s Edge might seem like a $60 game, but you should really budget another $50 on top of that, as a Pro Controller is practically (but not technically) required here. While the system’s signature Wii U GamePad is plenty ergonomic, it’s simply not a good fit, literally, for the kind of action Ninja Gaiden 3 throws at you. And as far as the GamePad’s screen goes, it’s not put to much use, with a moves list for the equipped weapon on display before you rather than tucked away in a menu. Fortunately, better weapons unlock as the bad guys get tougher. Visually, Ninja Gaiden 3 is hardly going to make your PS3 and Xbox-owning friends envious. In fact, Razor’s Edge is arguably uglier than its cousins, with bland textures and a bad case of the “jaggies” combining to create a muddy look that would’ve been called out seven years ago during the Xbox 360’s launch. Still, the framerate stays (mostly) smooth, which is crucial for a game like this. Plus, at this stage it’s nice – if admittedly a novelty – to be playing a Nintendo game in high-definition. Ninja Gaiden 3: Razor’s Edge might be the polar opposite of the usual Nintendo fare. The ‘M’ rating on the box is not a joke, what with the hyper-fast ninja action title’s unending display of severed limbs and decapitated heads. It’s fantastic to see this kind of hardcore gamer’s game on a Nintendo console – and at the Wii U’s launch, no less – and you can forget much of what you may have heard about the original release of this game earlier this year on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. It’s far from perfect and best viewed with “launch goggles” on, but Razor’s Edge’s unflinching action and unabashed violence is a great sign for the Wii U as a core gamer’s platform.
Casey Lynch	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/18/skylanders-giants-review	 For the kid in all of us, the Skylanders games do the impossible– they bring toys to life. Skylanders Giants didn't need to improve its magical formula much over last year’s Skylanders: Spyro’s Adventure, and it doesn't. Instead, the sequel delivers a more polished but by-the-numbers sequel that’s really fun to play. Though Giants is fundamentally a toy/video game hybrid, the software side of the beat-em-up, loot-collecting game feels something like a mash-up between the LEGO games and a lighthearted, kid-friendly version of Baldur’s Gate: Dark Alliance. It’s a clever, simple system: the Skylander characters appear on the screen when the toys are placed on a Portal of Power, up to two people can play at the same time, the toys save all of your progress and work on any console. This all works just as effortlessly as it did last year. If it didn't, Skylanders almost certainly wouldn't have sold 30 million of the things. Meet Ryan, Skylanders Giants&#Array; reviewer&#Array;s assistant. This is all just video game fancy talk to say that Skylanders is great fun. Just ask my son, Ryan. He’s eight years old and he LOVES Skylanders. And as the self-proclaimed Skylanders king at IGN, I looked to his expertise and experience when it came time to review the game. We played it together using his older Series 1 figures and a bunch of the new Giants and Lightcore Series 2 toys. After beating it several times, color us both renewed Skylanders fans. The real draw/gimmick/selling point to the game series is the Skylanders toys, which are sold separately and used to power the game. The titular Giants are the big draw this time around. Four Giants are available at launch – Tree Rex, Bouncer, Crusher and Swarm – with four more coming soon (Eye Brawl, Ninjini, Thumpback, and Hot Head), along with a bunch of new Series 2s that have multiple new attacks, upgrades, and moves. Oh, and unlike the original figures, they light up when place them on the Portal of Power. Yes, very cool. Giants change the game in several ways. They can smash through walls that previously required a bomb to destroy, they can smash holes in the ground to access new paths for extra loot and treasure (Hats, Soul Gems, and the like), they can throw boulders, and they push over tall rocks to create bridges, among many other skills. This changes things up just enough to feel fresh, and frankly, given their size and extra muscle, makes them an easy go-to pick for someone like me who’s trying to keep up with someone like Ryan. The Giants are easily able to take on both larger mini-boss and boss characters a bit more adeptly, but otherwise they play almost identically to other Skylanders.  The level cap has been raised to 15 for all Skylanders, too, which made it immediately fun to start playing older Series 1 toys that have been capped at Level 10 for a while. A horde of new upgrades, keys, potions, and hats are also available to spend your money on, which means you won’t run out of things to buy as quickly as you did in the first game. And the many hats in Giants buff out your characters with attribute improvements (Critical Hit, Speed, Defense, etc.), with plenty of good looks to spare. The story in Skylanders revolves around the Ancient Skylanders – the Giants – and how they were separated from their more diminutive counterparts. The plot really didn't matter that much though, not with so much stuff to crush and bad guys to beat up. Kaos and Eon are cool, and their voices are different (most of the characters can speak now, where previously they only mumbled in garbled Skylanders-speak, which helps them bring the whole experience to life), but none of that really mattered to Ryan. And not in a negative way, either. It’s just that he and I simply wanted to play more, to level more, to unlock new abilities, to pound on bad guys, and collect more dough to buy those sweet, sweet upgrades and hats. That went double for me. Bring on the loot. For me, playing Skylanders is really fun, especially with my son. It doesn’t ask much of you in the way of twitch reactions, puzzle-solving, or difficulty (though there are added difficulty settings this time around for those seeking a greater challenge). Much like many of the LEGO games, this is perfect for a parent to play with their kids. It’s not too challenging and it’s easy enough to jump in and play without having to learn complex controls or get a handle on what’s going on. You can&#Array;t argue with multiplatform-compatible toys. The boss fights are fun, and tougher than in the first game. Ryan noted that, “Some of them don’t have health bars, so you can’t tell when they’re going to die, but that’s OK.” They’re fairly varied as well -- one borrows bullet hell conventions, tasking you with switching the colors of a throbbing barrage of red ‘damage’ energies and blue ‘healing’ energies. Meanwhile, Battle Mode returns to offer straight forward one-on-one PvP fights for extra coin and experience. The arenas are fun and offer variety, but it’s only couch co-op (no online play) and again, only two players can jump into the fight. This feels like a great reason to increase the player cap to four, even only in PvP for starters. Going from two to four players would make this into a Power Stone 2-esque 3D brawler that could give Super Smash Bros. a run for its money. The same holds true with the story mode. Skylanders, with its horde of collectible toys, seems like the perfect party game, but it only accommodates two players at a time. Whether that’s a function created by the limitations of split-screen/hosting so many players on screen at once, or whether it’s a problem with the Portal of Power not being able to host or read more than two toys at a time, it still feels like a miss. Size-wise, you can squeeze four or five of the regular-sized Skylanders on the Portal, so we think it’s the latter. Why couldn&#Array;t they have these when we 30- and 40-somethings were kids? Movement in general still feels a bit slow, especially the Giants. Some have speed moves, like Tree Rex’s charge, but some don’t, and as a result feel really slow. Giants also inexplicably lacks a jump button, which feels strangely archaic. Granted, there are jump pads, glowing spots that indicate where to bounce up to higher ground, but the omission of a jumping mechanic feels odd in a brawler-platformer hybrid. The game also felt shorter, its 16 chapters feeling brief compared the first game’s 22 (post-release Adventure Packs added another 4 levels as well, a strategy that will likely return with Giants). If you're interested in going back and playing Spyro's Adventure with the Series 2 reposed toys, they will function but without any of the new benefits (they play like Series 1 toys), but the Giants will not work, which is a bit of bummer, but understandable. Then there’s the Soul Gems, which serve only to bait children into wanting more toys. See, every time you find a Soul Gem, it cues up a preview trailer of what that toy’s powers are – toys you likely don’t already own. Talk about incentivizing kids to ask their parents for new toys. This statement happens often at our house: “Mom, Mom, I found such-and-such’s Soul Gem, the movie is so cool, we have to get him. Can we? Can we? Can we?” Thanks, Skylanders. Your Soul Gems videos are writing our holiday shopping list for us. Here's the thing, though. These are largely the gripes of a 40-year-old man hemming and hawing about what I think should be in the game. Considering how successfully Giants delivers its one-of-a-kind, genius toy/video game crossover with endless replay value, the new Skylanders is a great offering of fun, loot, and, yes, tons of hats. Skylanders Giants improves the formula set out by the first game in a number of small but meaningful ways. The Giants are fun to play with and mix things up. The increased level cap and loads of new items and upgrades to buy make it fun to jump back in, as do the addition of new toys to collect. Only supporting two players and no online play still feel like misses, as does the inability to jump. The package, as a whole, doesn't push the genre or the Skylanders universe in radical ways, but the additions are welcome and ultimately great fun.
	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/29/project-zero-2-wii-edition-review	 There aren’t many survival-horror aficionados who would dispute that the Project Zero/Fatal Frame games rank alongside the finest that the genre has offered over its bumpy-but-glorious twenty-year history. With its snap-happy combat, relentlessly sinister ambience and nightmarish narrative, Tecmo's series deserved far better than mere cult status. That's fine, but why release a 2003-vintage PS2 title just before the Wii passes the baton onto the upcoming Wii U? Also, why only release it in Europe and Japan (no North American release date has been confirmed yet)? Well, there's evidently a method to the madness, with Nintendo now officially co-owning the IP to the ghost-busting series – perhaps it sees the excellent Project Zero 2 as the ideal opportunity to 'relaunch' the brand in advance of an all-new Project Zero/Fatal Frame on the Wii U. We can but hope. Unlike so many games from our misspent youth, Project Zero 2 has aged remarkably well and arrives on the Wii feeling perhaps fresher than it did all those years ago. With classic survival horror conspicuous by its absence in 2012, going back to explore the murderous mysteries of the mist-shrouded All God's Village is a rare treat. For the benefit of those of you who missed out on Tecmo's classic the first time around, the story focuses on the perilous journey of twin sisters Mio and Mayu, who stumble upon an eerie village where the tortured souls of the dead roam. But their misfortune is somewhat balanced out when they chance upon the Camera Obscura - no, not fey Scottish indie popsters, but an antique device that can take pictures of the undead and exorcise their spirit in the process.  The game's ghost-busting combat is endlessly fraught.  Armed with this one and only weapon, you work your way around the village and its various rickety buildings, zapping ghosts and finding objects that help you gain access to the next section. Structurally, it's classic survival horror fodder, albeit in a satisfyingly self-contained set of environments that keep annoying backtracking to a minimum. The real star of the show, of course, is the game's endlessly fraught ghost-busting camera combat, and it's an element that's tailor made for the Wii's fluid point-and-click control system. During your travels, you'll inevitably stumble across a few tortured souls angling for some aggro, and - more often than not - the only way to progress is to put these screeching spooks out of their misery. Rather than wee yourself and curl up in a ball when a ghost approaches, the answer is to whip out your mighty Camera Obscura and show this undead the power of exorcism. Loaded up with special ghost sensitive film, the action flicks to a first person viewfinder mode, whereupon you attempt to take a series of ghost-troubling snaps to literally suck the life (or death) out of them. By tilting the Wiimote, you can adjust your viewing angle, and by locking-on with the Z button, you can begin to charge up your shot. Once the reticule is fully filled, you're ready to loose off a shot with the B button, repeating the process until they're finally out of commission.  As a mechanic, it's deliciously nerve-wracking.  As a mechanic, it's deliciously nerve-wracking, with each ghost wriggling around with inconsiderate unpredictability, nipping in-and-out of shot, and often re-appearing right behind you to give you a welcoming hug. This being a Wii version, such moments of intimacy result in you having to flail for your life, so make sure pets and other loved ones are out of arm's reach before you wind up giving someone a black eye in a moment of uncontrolled alarm. Nintendo has also managed to turn the simple task of object collection into a disproportionately nervy minigame, with ghostly hands often reaching in for a smooch just as you're about to pick something up. It's enough to give those of a nervous disposition a heart attack. There’s also a new Haunted House mode brought to this special Wii Edition. Each of the Haunted House missions is curated by the sinister Kureha, who likes nothing more than to hear the piercing shrieks of the terminally afraid. Set in a sequence of on-rails missions, the basic premise of these short interludes is to walk slowly from A to B without keeling over with fright, as the game measures your jumps and terrified flailing through the Wii remote and nunchuck’s motion sensors. Some test you in your ability to remain cool and calm while being subjected to various other worldly shrieks, moans, bangs, warped faces and generally unsettling nonsense, while others task you with collecting dolls while being chased by everyone's worst nightmare: a long-haired Asian goth schoolgirl. Turning around periodically stops her in her tracks, but if you allow her to get too close, you must suffer the indignity of an unwelcome cuddle. And we all know how that feels. Aside from this welcome-but-throwaway new mode, most other changes to the Wii Edition are subtle and cosmetic, with widescreen support, a new pulled-back third person camera angle, cleaned-up visuals, brand new voice acting and a slightly less cutesy look to Mio and Mayu - not that the latter point will be especially apparent if you've not played the original for a long time. By and large, remakes and reissues for the Wii rarely feel like essential purchases, but we're prepared to make an exception in the case of Project Zero 2. Apart from being one of the most compelling survival horror games of the past decade, there's no getting away from the fact that it still feels as fresh and unique as it did almost a decade ago. And with its thrilling brand of ghost-busting combat making a perfect transition to the Wii, this is an enduring classic that every horror fan should have in their collection.
	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/06/18/lego-batman-2-dc-super-heroes-wii-review	" LEGO games are cute, funny and easy to jump into, but they've also been around since 2005. Whenever someone wandered by my desk and spied me playing LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes, he or she would undoubtedly say ""Yup, it's another LEGO game"" before wandering off. Trouble is, LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes isn't just another LEGO game. It does away with hard-to-judge platforming, its puzzles make sense, and it adds a couple of big things that are sure to become staples for the LEGO franchise moving forward. The changes come with growing pains, but there's no denying that LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is a great video game.    Yes, that's the PlayStation 3 / Xbox 360 video review up there. Most of that applies to the Wii version of LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes as the game packs the same content as the HD twins. It just isn't HD because it's on the Wii. While a bummer -- there's a lot of pop-in and flat visuals -- it's impressive that the Wii has the same story, characters and content. So, if you have no other choice, the LEGO Batman 2 on the Wii will fit the superhero bill.   Like the previous game, LEGO Batman 2 spins an original yarn, but this time it's engaging and really interesting. Lex Luthor is running for president, teaming with the Joker and using kryptonite to stuff the ballot box. With foulness afoot, Batman, Robin, Superman and eventually the entire Justice League step in to stop the plot. This plays out via traditional LEGO game controls. You jump, punch and switch between characters with button presses. The Wiimote allows you to precisely aim batarangs and grappling hooks, but the lack of a second stick means you can only center the camera behind you and not control it. A friend on the couch can drop in and out for co-op in a jiff. The game's as simple to understand as ever, but adds new suits for Batman and Robin along with powers for specific characters. Black Canary has her sonic blast, Cyborg is magnetized, and Wonder Woman can lasso hard to reach handles.  That's what LEGO games are all about -- exploring and collecting -- and LEGO Batman does that better than any iteration that's come before. It's a focused story that's entertaining from start to finish, and part of that is thanks to voice acting. For the first time in LEGO history, LEGO Batman 2 packs a full voice cast to tell its tale. While the silent LEGO games have always been funny, LEGO Batman 2 is able to move beyond shrugs and grins. Robin fanboying out over Superman, Vicki Vale's newscasts, and Lex trying to convince Joker that killing Batman is a good idea -- these are brilliant moments we would've lost without the excellent actors. Among these actors is Superman: The Animated Series' Clancy Brown reprising his role as Lex Luthor. Fresh voices are used for most of the other characters, but the new takes are welcome. Of course, the story is just a tiny sliver of any LEGO game. You'll run through the 15-chapter story of LEGO Batman 2 in about nine hours (probably a lot less if you don't methodically smash everything like I did and get distracted by side stuff), but then you'll replay levels for more studs (in-game currency) and to find collectables such as mini-kit parts. That's what LEGO games are all about -- exploring and collecting -- and LEGO Batman does that better than any iteration that's come before. See, LEGO Batman 2 has another first for the series: an open world. While LEGO games always have a HUB world, they're usually a bit limited. LEGO Batman 2 gives you all of Gotham City to explore. Arkham Asylum, Ace Chemicals, GCPD -- it's an entire town and it's packed with stuff to collect, save and explore. Hit the gas, Dark Knight. (PS3 Version) Red bricks are tucked around corners and unlock cheats, new characters appear on rooftops, and bosses are around to fight and add to your playable roster. There are vehicles to purchase and then drive, people to save and so many studs to collect. Still, it's the Gold Bricks that stand out. There are 250 Golden Bricks. While you'll get them for completing objectives in story missions, the majority are hidden around Gotham and only accessible via certain characters. Plenty of times I'd be flying around as Superman (the John Williams theme plays any time Kal-El is airborne), spot a Gold Brick, and have to work my way from the goal to the beginning of the challenge so that Robin in his acrobat suit or Batman in his electricity suit could go through the Mousetrap-like obstacle course to unlock the brick the appropriate way. The Gold Bricks are these little challenges inside the greater world that keep you on your toes and have you trying out the more than 50-character roster that includes the Flash, Hush, Martian Manhunter and more. Of course, bringing in all of this new stuff creates a few new – albeit minor -- problems. Zooming around this open world as Flash or Superman, I'd land at objectives and have to wait for the computer terminal I needed to pop in. While the map will show you where bosses and unlockables are, you can't zoom in to really orient where you should be looking so there's a lot of moving a few feet, pausing and reevaluating. The game saves when you nab a Gold Brick, but for some crazy reason, you can't move while it autosaves. Again, developer Traveller's Tales has nailed the gameplay issues that have plagued the franchise for years, but now, the designers have to take some notes on how modern open worlds work. (Although Red Bricks do eventually label unlockables on the screen.)   Greg is the executive editor of IGN PlayStation, cohost of Podcast Beyond and host of Up at Noon. Follow IGN on Twitter, and keep track of Greg's shenanigans on IGN and Twitter. Beyond! LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes is a collector's paradise. You have to play through the game to get studs to unlock characters to go back to old levels and access different areas to collect more secrets. I polished off the story in about nine hours, but I spent the next 11 chasing down bricks and characters -- and I'm still not done. The open world stuff could use some tweaks, but the little stumbles don't stop LEGO Batman 2: DC Super Heroes from being a great game."
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	 The original Knack was met with a decidedly lukewarm reception, and for good reason. It didn’t really know what it wanted to be – it was too punitive to be a kids game, but it lacked the sophistication or variety to be anything much more. The sequel isn’t without problems, but it’s much improved, with a solid mix of gameplay elements, anchored by fun combat and good pacing. Knack’s core abilities remain much the same. He’s able to gather relics to grow in size, gaining strength and resilience in the process, and allowing for some fun shifts in scale. These are still very much prescribed – there’s no player strategy associated with growing larger, but that doesn’t mean it’s any less entertaining to rampage through a city as a 20 foot leviathan, sweeping aside enemies that once offered a challenge with a single blow. Knack can also shed his relics in an instant to fit into small doorways, skirt under spinning blades or leap between little ledges, then reform on the other side. It’s an enjoyably dynamic ability and heavily factors into Knack 2’s platforming, puzzle solving and secrets.  If you’ve ever played a platform game before you know what to expect here – elaborate gauntlets comprised of moving platforms, tricks, traps, steam vents and the like. The puzzle solving is similarly familiar – you’re shifting blocks around, weighing down pressure sensitive switches, bouncing lasers off mirrors to activate doohickies and so on. That’s not to say these sequences aren’t well-designed or satisfying, however – they are – they’re just staples of the genre. There are just enough ingredients to keep things fresh too. Like the last game, Knack can gain an armour-like shell made up of different materials like ice, metal or iron. Ice Knack can freeze enemies on the spot, for instance, but he can also lock gears in place. And if you shift back to small Knack from any of these forms you’ll leave behind a statue that can be used to weigh down switches. It’s simple stuff, and the game decides when and how you use these abilities, but they’re engaging nonetheless, and in line with what Knack 2 wants to be – a well-paced action platformer with puzzle elements, in which the player is always making progress. Checkpointing is generous, so if you miss a jump or get killed in combat, you’re generally only moments away from where you died.  To that end, checkpointing is generous, so if you miss a jump or get killed in combat, you’re generally only moments away from where you died. That’s definitely appreciated, and means you’ll rarely get frustrated. On normal difficulty there are a few minor challenge spikes, but it’s pitched about right for average gamers, and combat encounters mix and match enemies to force you to prioritise and use different tactics. Electrical enemies need to be disabled before you can attack, for instance, while projectiles can be parried, shield-bearing foes can be opened up with a heavy attack, distance can be closed using a spinning overhead whip and groups of small, squishy enemies can be pummelled with a body slam. There are some neat touches that add additional layers to combat too, such as the ability to stun enemies whenever a sunstone is shattered, so you can factor any sunstones in the combat arena into your plan for dispatching the pack. More and more combat options open up as you progress through the story and spend points in Knack’s skill trees. Perhaps the most pleasant surprise in Knack 2 is just how much fun co-op is. You can play through the whole game with a friend or family member, and having two Knacks on-screen ups the chaos in combat significantly. There are some clever gameplay flourishes that are only available in co-op too, such as the ability to kick the other player into enemies, set off explosions by body slamming your co-op partner and literally punching relics off them like a machine gun. It’s a little less fun outside combat, but at least platforming sequences only need one player to make it to the end, then the other can just warp to their position. It’s the ideal solution for younger co-op partners.  Given how much fun Knack is to control, it’s a real shame that outside of gameplay he’s one of the blandest characters in modern video games. He has almost no discernible personality. He’s simply up for whatever (clobbering things generally) and most utterances are perfunctory at best – “let’s do this” – as if he’s channelling Vin Diesel but forgot the powerful personality behind the laconic style. Small Knack, on the other hand, doesn’t talk at all, and the game only makes half-hearted attempts at physical comedy. Outside of gameplay, Knack is one of the blandest characters in modern video games.  It’s a massive missed opportunity. Knack is meant to be a mystically sentient life form – new to this world, essentially – so why isn’t that explored? Where’s his sense of wonder? Or confusion? Or growing understanding about the world? The absence of any kind of meaningful dialogue, and thus on-screen relationship, with the main human protagonist Lucas is also baffling. Shouldn’t their dynamic be at the heart of the game? There was so much more Japan Studio could have done with this duo. The cast of largely uninteresting characters is wrapped into a story that would be at home in a second-rate Saturday morning kids cartoon. It’s a tale of High Goblins and city-devouring robots, ancient technologies and revenge plans… with some painfully awkward adolescent romantic tension tossed in for good measure. By the end the stakes are suitably high and you’ll become invested simply because, well, you’re ten hours in now, but it’s not good. Big adventure, little characterisation. Knack 2 is pretty uneven in terms of its presentation overall. There are moments of beauty, and the direction during the quick time events is appropriately stylish and energetic, but the worlds on display are merely adequate from a technical perspective, and your companions are disappointingly wooden, lacking in anything but the most basic of animations during missions. They’re also often capable of inexplicable teleportation. I lost count of the number of times I took Knack on some impossibly acrobatic, combat-heavy route only for my human counterparts to simply turn up at the other end. One section sees Knack literally beam himself over a gaping chasm using a power available only to him and moments later – ta da! – there they are. It honestly seems harder not to implement an explanation. Just put a cable car across the chasm and activate it from the other side. Done. In a later mission they actually appear ahead of you – on the other side of a bridge that’s out. After you’ve fought a dozen enemies to get to where you are. And they’re armourless, weaponless, ordinary humans. Knack 2 is pretty uneven in terms of its presentation overall.  Knack 2 is lazy in other areas too. We’re all used to being artificially locked in an arena until we’ve defeated the enemies and can progress, for instance, but most games at least go to the effort of making it, like, an energy barrier or something blocking the way. In Knack 2 it is often literal blockades that simply disintegrate when the last enemy falls. It doesn’t really matter in gameplay terms, but it all adds up to a game that feels slapdash in many areas, and underestimates the intelligence of its audience. (“It’s just for kids, right?”) It is fun though, and there’s a fair bit of content here. You’re looking at around 12 hours from start to finish to play through the story, which then unlocks New Game+, as well as a time attack mode that offers a host of bespoke challenges, and the ability to re-do any level to finish off sub-missions. I can definitely see the appeal of continuing on – I had a few more perks to unlock at the end of the story, and I was really enjoying having a full suite of combat abilities at my claw-tips. Knack 2 is lacking in a number of areas, but its strengths outweigh its weaknesses. The pacing is spot-on, the combat satisfying and the gameplay varied. Co-op is genuinely good fun too, and most definitely the best way for younger gamers to get into the action. Knack 2 is definitely a step up from the original, then, but until the writing and characterisation improve drastically, it’s not going to be a true first party titan.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/24/f1-2017-review	 In this year’s Azerbaijan Grand Prix Ferrari driver Sebastian Vettel had a real brain snap on track, pulling up alongside rival Lewis Hamilton’s Mercedes and steering into him during a safety car restart. During the Russian Grand Prix, in the first year of my F1 2017 career, he’s done something similar. He’s turned into Hamilton at race pace and managed to tangle himself, Lewis, and my F1 wunderkind Jackie Speedweasel together for a date with the wall. I manage to extract my driver from the mess, grazing the wall and losing part of the front wing in the process, but Hamilton and Vettel’s cars are toast; a snarl of carbon fibre shards and loose wheels. It’s still very early days but the championship has pivoted in an instant. This kind of split-second unpredictability is a staple of real F1 and Codemasters continues to capture it. F1 2017 is a confident and comprehensive racer that succeeds by embracing all of modern F1’s idiosyncratic rules and regulations, as well as its danger, and baking it all into a truly great sports sim. It challenges us with volatile racing but rewards consistency, patience, and strategy. It’s not the dramatic improvement that last year’s instalment was over the disappointing F1 2015 – overall there’s more iteration than innovation this year – but it definitely usurps F1 2016 as Codemasters’ greatest F1 game to date.  This year’s Formula One season saw a massive shake-up in car regulations, which has resulted in bigger cars with wider tyres and improved aero. Basically, the cars are heavier but faster. Codemasters has responded, bringing all of that extra girth, grip, and speed to the new cars in F1 2017. On a steering wheel it’s probably the best force feedback I’ve ever felt in a Codemasters game and the sense of weight is terrific, but even on a pad the extra bite is noticeable. The 2017 cars feel like they’re clinging to the road a fraction more tenaciously than their 2016 counterparts.  The sense of weight is terrific. Also featured is a smattering of retro rides from yesteryear, with 11 (or 12, with the special edition) extra F1 icons from five teams included (from Senna’s championship-winning 1991 McLaren to Schumacher’s beastly 2004 Ferrari). They do feel very distinct from the modern cars, and each other, and it’s fun to compare and contrast them. They also sound fantastic, but I don’t know whether or not that’s just because contemporary F1 cars sound like an angry blowfly trying to escape from an upturned bucket in comparison. This Ferrari still holds a host of current lap records, 13 years later. F1 2017’s classic cars are weaved through the career mode in a series of invitational events, which vary between overtaking challenges, checkpoint challenges, and handicap and multiclass races. They’re a bit like the Showcase Events in Forza Motorsport 6. I think it’s a clever and credible way of getting these old cars out on modern circuits, but the limited, greatest hits-style approach results in copies of the same car out on track whenever they’re all out racing.   There have been no new circuits added to the 2017 calendar so we have to make do with the same tracks we had in F1 2016. Four of them do have new short routes we can use in custom GPs and time trials, but their effect on the overall package isn’t really seismic. What’s notable is that all the tracks appear more vibrant and realistic than ever, and the desaturated tones that have defined Codemasters racing games for many years seem to have been finally trashed. The grass glows a rich, deep green, the skies burn a brilliant blue, and everything in between looks more lifelike than ever. This is a really good-looking racing game, from the neon glow of Singapore’s skyscrapers to the shiny, wet asphalt of Albert Park.  All the tracks appear more vibrant and realistic than ever. Off-track things are a little less impressive (the engine is great at dealing with carbon fibre, bitumen, concrete, and rubber, but not so great with skin or hair) but I think this stuff is still a crucial part of the sporting atmosphere that makes F1 2017 work. My chief complaint here is that most of these paddock and podium vignettes are recycled from F1 2015 and F1 2016, so they’re very stale at this stage. I think we need some fresh flourishes next time around. Female drivers are available in F1 2017, although I'm pretty sure Jackie Speedweasel is bald.   While Codemasters still hasn’t added Dan Ricciardo’s signature podium celebration, it has added some significant tweaks to the 10-season career experience, which is really the most fulfilling part of this whole package. The research and development system has been drastically broadened, with an RPG-esque development tree that branches out across over 100 individual upgrades. Tables indicate the areas your team is trailing in – driving for Red Bull I’ve focussed almost exclusively on power unit upgrades to try and get back on terms with Mercedes and Ferrari – but the goal posts are always shifting as rival teams complete their own R&D. If it’s all a bit too obtuse you can ask for your engineer’s recommendations. Reliability throughout the season is also a real issue now as we need to manage wear on key car components over the course of the year. The older a part is the more prone to failures it will be, something I learned when I lost a gear in Azerbaijan, and then learned again when my turbo went on the fritz in Canada, and then learned again when I couldn’t select lean fuel mode in... Japan, I think. I had a bunch of stuff break. I lost track. Oh, come on! The special thing about it is that it never really feels unfair; it just feels authentic. The lean fuel setting loss was a curly one because the delicate balancing act that is conserving fuel throughout a race is again a mini-game unto itself in F1 2017, but this time with a twist. One of the new practice programs in F1 2017 is fuel saving (coasting into corners, braking later, upshifting earlier) and if you perform well in this test your team will underfuel you for the main race. This will reduce weight but means you have to be driving with fuel saving in mind, or you will run out.  Codemasters’ ability to make the whole race weekend meaningful remains admirable. Codemasters’ ability to make the whole race weekend meaningful remains admirable and everything you achieve in practice, qualifying, and racing still adds to your development point haul. The best way to play F1 2017 remains with at least 25% race distance selected (where opponent errors, safety cars, pit strategies, and dynamic weather changes all come into play) but part wear is still scaled to your career even if you choose the shortest, five-lap races. As with F1 2016, race distance and AI ability can be adjusted between every round, meaning we’re never stuck with a decision for a full, 20-race season. The key side effect of all this preparation, micro-management, and on-track unpredictability is drama. It began in F1 2016 last year and it carries on here. Do you order that new engine part and cop a hefty grid penalty, or do you stick with a worn one from your original allocation? Do you stay out for one more lap on a set of nearly-cooked intermediates once the track has mostly dried up – to avoid double-stacking in the pits – or do you play it safe and come in right behind your teammate? That front left is pretty much cooked, at this stage. F1 2017 is jammed with drama, and that’s a big part of what makes it so satisfying to tackle. The one thing it could do with more of, though, is emotion. If Codemasters wants the F1 series to sit alongside other sports sims like FIFA, or NBA 2K, or MLB The Show, there has to be a better way to tell players they’re world champion than a text box. F1 2017 isn’t light years ahead of the already very good F1 2016 but the new cars, retro content, and the juiced-up career mode make a very strong case for the upgrade, and I really appreciated the enhanced force feedback on a wheel. Rich with details and faithful to just about everything that makes contemporary F1 tick, F1 2017 is about as good a simulation of a single, modern motorsport as you can get.
Heidi Kemps	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/21/yakuza-kiwami-review	 Ten years ago, Sega introduced us to Kazuma Kiryu, a badass ex-Yakuza who keeps getting sucked back into the world of Japan’s underground organized crime. Yakuza Kiwami is a trip back to Kiryu’s first adventure, complete with all-new visuals, a restored Japanese dub, and gameplay enhancements that bring it nearly up to the level of more recent Yakuza games. While it’s a great way to re-experience how the Yakuza saga began, Yakuza Kiwami also showcases just how much the Yakuza series has improved since that original outing. While the riveting crime drama story of Kazuma Kiryu emerging from a prison stint after taking the fall for a friend remains the same as the original Yakuza, the details on the character models and backgrounds have been completely reworked to look on par with other Yakuza games on the PS4. That gives Kiwami a cinematic feel that helped me get into the twists and turns of its betrayals and action. The graphical upgrade also helps Kamurocho feel more vibrant and alive as a recreation of a bustling Japanese nightlife area, Tokyo’s neon-lit Kamurocho, and is packed with attention to detail (including real-life brands and stores). The distinct feel of the Japanese setting is one of the most appealing parts of the Yakuza series, and Kiwami continues to nail it.  Gameplay has seen a substantial improvement as well. Instead of the clunky-feeling combat in the original we get something much more like the recent Yakuza 0, where Kiryu can use several different fighting styles and earn upgrades to boost his power and learn new moves. Kiryu’s brutal beatdowns feel like the kind of raw, unrefined fighting you would associate with a criminal underworld. While three of Kiryu’s selectable fighting styles – Brawler, Rush, and Beast – carry over from Yakuza 0, Kiwami does drop the ball in teaching you how the styles differ and how they’re best used. In contrast, Yakuza 0 went to great lengths to teach the ins and outs of each fighting style, helping you grow acquainted to combat more thoroughly.  You’ll encounter the lovably weird Goro Majima. Besides combat, exploration and character interactions have also seen an overhaul. Fighting randomly encountered enemies as you explore Kamurocho’s back alleys is seamless, and when you see innocent people in need you can intervene to help them out for rewards. And sometimes, when you least expect it, you’ll encounter the lovably weird Goro Majima, who’s determined to help Kiryu re-learn all the fighting prowess he lost while imprisoned by using the strangest means possible. Fan-favorite sidequests like visiting hostess clubs, chilling at the batting range, and belting out songs at karaoke make their return alongside some new activities. The oddest is a bizarre female wrestling game like the one seen in Yakuza 0 – only this time, it’s framed as a spinoff of an actual Japanese Sega arcade game about fighting insects. Yeah, I’m a little puzzled by it, but it’s this kind of offbeat weirdness alongside high drama that gives the Yakuza series its distinct charm. You’ll see plenty of other peculiar people and bizarre situations across Kiwami’s sidestories, though compared to some of the strange scenarios in Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 0 they seem a bit tame.  Even with new additions, however, Yakuza Kiwami feels especially light on content compared to recent series games like Yakuza 5 and Yakuza 0, which can run more than 70 hours. The main story is around a third that long, and most of the side stories are easy to clear. That does explain why Sega is selling Kiwami at a lower price than usual.  The first couple hours of are not great. A much bigger problem with Yakuza Kiwami  is that Sega passed up a crucial opportunity to improve the overall flow by trimming out and refining parts that never worked well. Honestly, the first couple hours of are not great: they involve an obnoxious fetch quest to retrieve a ring and a tedious stealth sequence infiltrating a funeral. Only after slogging your way through these are you able to see the first of several lengthy, fun action sequences and have the whole of Kamurocho open up to your exploration. The structure of Yakuza Kiwami’s story also has some pretty significant flaws. Time jumps and flashbacks out of nowhere make following certain story threads confusing, and there are points where the main plot gets frustratingly sidetracked just as things are getting interesting and it focuses instead on side characters. The fact that there are some entirely new story cutscenes added in – some of which make this problem worse – leaves me wondering why Sega didn’t do a more dramatic revamp to bring the flow more in line with the modern Yakuza games, which put a lot of similar character development into the optional substories instead. Yakuza Kiwami makes great strides in updating the classic original Yakuza game to modern standards. But while it adds better combat, bizarrely charming side quests, and a gorgeous graphical revamp, it also ignores some of the original’s biggest problems in pacing and storytelling. And because of its relatively short length, Yakuza Kiwami’s fun trip through the tangled web of Japan’s criminal underground feels like a prelude to something bigger and better to come.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	 No one should play Uncharted: The Lost Legacy without first playing the rest of Naughty Dog’s epic adventure series. A side effect of that, however, is that no one who plays The Lost Legacy will experience much they haven’t seen before. This standalone adventure, set after the events of Uncharted 4, is packed with the beautiful vistas, exciting action, and memorable characters we expect from an Uncharted game, but the familiarity of it all made Lost Legacy feel more like a by-the-numbers summer blockbuster than the milestone events that came before it. I had a distinct sense of deja vu with nearly every action scene of this six-hour adventure. Every shootout with disposable guns against mindless paramilitary dudes, every crumbling wall I had to climb and shimmy across, and every floaty driving sequence across the Indian planes felt directly lifted out of the previous Uncharted games. It feels like replaying a great linear action game game – still good, but without the novelty and suspense.   The benefit of rehashing some of the high points of the series is that Lost Legacy mostly trims out some of the more tedious mechanics of Uncharted 4 (I’m looking at you, winching). In fact, it oftentimes subverts expectations in clever, self-referential ways. For example, there’s a moment in the opening act where you have to repeat one of those boring and ubiquitous crate-platforming sections from the last game. But when the crate smashes through the floor and sends your characters plummeting down, one replies “No more crates.” And sure enough, those banal roadblocks are stricken from the rest of the adventure.   One idea that does feel fresh is the occasional puzzles that block the path, which provide a great palate-cleanser to the action. Solutions often require careful observation of the world around you for environmental clues, such as the way specific light sources cast shadows, which I always loved doing considering just how stupidly gorgeous Naughty Dog’s depiction of India is. The game knows how to draw your eye toward the smallest detail, which is a testament to the art, lighting, and camera work in cinematics.   Lost Legacy looks and sounds spectacular in gameplay, too. It’s peppered with iconic moments that feel like you’re in control of a giant Hollywood action scene. I love how these thrilling sections always give me the sensation of scrambling along the edge of a knife, barely surviving in one piece, even though they’re largely scripted. The one gameplay area where Lost Legacy tries to switch things up is in its second act, where it goes semi-open-world and we're given the largest playspace the Uncharted series has ever seen. But no matter how beautiful this area is – and holy moly is it gorgeous – it's empty when it comes to things to do, and frankly boring. A good open-world map promotes and rewards exploration and curiosity, but Uncharted's seems to actively punish those things in several ways. It fills the environment with surfaces that appear climbable but are insurmountable. Nothing destroys your momentum quite like running up to a pillar that you assume you can scramble up, only to have Chloe bump off of it awkwardly. Likewise, there are several spots throughout Lost Legacy with jumps that appear easily doable, but if you attempt them you’ll find yourself dead for no apparent reason. Finally, while there are dozens of collectable trinkets scattered across the world, there’s no real incentive for seeking them out. For a game that’s ultimately about a group of people trying to find treasure, I was disappointed to walk away from this open-world experiment empty handed.     The main element that continued to propel me forward through the adventure is the fantastic dynamic between Chloe and Nadine. I really loved the fact that Naughty Dog took these two side characters from past games and put them front and center in this pressure cooker. Exploring their backgrounds, discovering their motivations, and watching them grow was simply fantastic. It’s remarkable how well the pair handle shifts between somber moments of gravity and light comedic interludes. Probably the biggest compliment I can pay the story and characters is that at no point did I think to myself, “Man, I wish Nathan Drake were here.” The main villain in Lost Legacy, on the other hand, is a bit lacking in his motivations. While I enjoyed how he was written and performed, it just seemed like he was evil for evil’s sake. I was much more interested in watching Chloe and Nadine grow as characters than I was in their direct conflict with this arms dealer. Uncharted: The Lost Legacy succeeds on the strength of its protagonists, writing, and phenomenal depiction of India’s jungles and ruins. Being in the company of Chloe and Nadine keeps its overly familiar action sequences and disappointingly empty open-world area interesting, and it regains its footing in smart puzzles and thrilling cinematic moments.
Tom Marks	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/10/lawbreakers-review-in-progress	 There’s an art to riding that terrifying line between falling and flying, but the falling is inevitable. LawBreakers’ fast-paced gun duels play out like thrilling highwire dances: You try to stay afloat and in control long enough to win each fight, then land and regroup to fight again. Even if the maps and game modes aren’t always as exciting as the fights themselves, drop kicking an enemy with a pair of laser boots and then using that momentum to soar halfway across the arena is extremely fun. LawBreakers is filled with moments like that. It’s an exhilarating 5v5 hero-based first-person shooter where a lot of the excitement comes directly from the movement itself, rather than just killstreaks or point captures. Those violent moments are there too, but chaining jumps and boosts together to soar through a low-gravity area can be just as rewarding as getting a double kill.   All of LawBreakers’ nine roles (each of which is shared by two characters) let you explore its levels in a different way and at a different speed. The Assassin can swing like Spider-Man with a ridiculously fun grappling hook; the Wraith can slide on the floor for a speed boost and then triple jump through the air; and the Juggernaut can barely get off the ground, but makes up for it with a whole lot of health and chunky shotgun. There’s overlap in the jobs they can get done, but I love that they are varied enough that I could pick roles based on the map or mode I was in. I could even change it up mid-match depending on what was happening without restrictions based on how many teammates were already playing a given role. In the Uplink and Overcharge modes (both twists on Capture the Flag), for example, I would start with the Wraith to quickly grab the objective in the center of the map and bring it back to our base, then swap to the slower Juggernaut to defend it, trading mobility for stopping power on demand.   The teams are split into Law versus Breakers – or as kids everywhere know them, cops versus robbers – but thankfully the roles are identical for either team. What changes is their look, depending on which side you’re on. For example, the Law Harrier is a bubbly woman with a mohawk named Sunshine who has an adorable but deadly heart-shaped laser on her chest, while the Breaker Harrier is a slick man with an afro called Baron with a far less adorable but just as deadly X-shaped laser instead.  LawBreakers is an attractive game, but it lacks any sort of interesting or distinct voice.  Aside from their cosmetic differences, the characters themselves have one thing in common: They are shallow. Sunshine is probably one of the most distinct personalities in the 18-person roster, but even she feels fairly bland as there’s really nothing to her beyond the heart and the hair. It felt like LawBreakers went through the motions of what’s expected from a hero-based shooter without actually fleshing any of those characters out in a meaningful way. Each of them seem to have bits of personality (like Sunshine’s heart) bolted onto an otherwise generic-looking ‘future soldier.’ That isn’t to say LawBreakers looks bad. It’s an attractive game with well-modeled characters and maps, and some cool visual effects when you enter and exit low-gravity, but it lacks any sort of interesting or distinct voice. The maps have a similar problem, as it sort of feels like every level in LawBreakers started with the same metallic-future skin set before a theme was plastered onto it without much thought as to why, whether it be cherry trees or some snow on the ground. This naturally doesn’t affect their function as places to move, shoot, and be shot in, but compared to the sense of place created by Overwatch’s maps they feel a little soulless.   That lack of personality isn’t too distracting – LawBreakers is here to let you shoot dudes in spectacular fashion, not chat about backstory or lore. The less aesthetic issue is that the silhouettes of each character are so similar that it isn’t always easy to determine who you’re floating toward before they start firing at you. Clarity is important because so many of the fights happen at a very long distance.  Swimming through the air using my own gun as a paddle is fun and challenging.  There are some flashy but purely cosmetic gun and character skins you can unlock through randomized loot boxes, but they aren’t very distracting during matches. Alternatively, you can buy boxes for real money, but wisely nothing that actually affects gameplay is locked behind that system. It can be completely ignored if you’d prefer to do so, with no consequences beyond having to wait for the luck of the draw before you can stab people with a fluorescent green bayonet. What sets LawBreakers’ spectacular firefights apart more than anything are its low-gravity areas, which are part of almost every map design. Swimming through the air using jetpacks, grappling hooks, or even my own gun as a paddle of sorts is fun and challenging because it practically asks you to learn to walk again. I particularly love the characters with multiple jumps, which I could use to both manage my height and juke my opponents. Fighting in low-gravity has a skill cap I’m nowhere near reaching, and trying to master those mechanics is easily the main thing that’s kept me coming back to LawBreakers.   LawBreakers launched with eight decently designed maps, but six of them feel so similar they sometimes blur together. Each one has a curved, indoor flanking path with regular gravity, wrapped around a larger open area with a low-gravity bubble. They aren’t bad maps and the specific corridors on each are unique, but they don’t really explore what else LawBreakers could be doing, leaving me wanting more (and only sort of in the good, anticipatory way).   The two levels that don’t follow this formula, Vertigo and Redfall, are undoubtedly my favorite and least favorite maps, respectively. Vertigo is a straight map with a raised low-gravity bubble in the center and tons of open airspace. The whole structure you are fighting on is floating in the sky, which lets mobile characters like Assassin, Vanguard, and Herrier truly stretch their wings. If I managed my momentum well, I could boost or swing under the entire map, popping up behind the enemy spawn. It’s a map that lets what is so enjoyable about LawBreakers shine brightly.  Every mode provides an interesting twist on common game modes like Capture the Flag or King of the Hill.  Redfall, on the other hand, fails to play to LawBreakers’ strengths. It’s a map with no low-gravity areas whatsoever, which is a downright baffling choice given how great those areas are on the seven other levels. It’s not that LawBreakers isn’t fun outside of low-gravity – it’s still a fast-paced shooter with some very fun dueling moments. But so many of its characters and abilities become less useful or just less interesting without those bubbles to fight in. LawBreakers’ five game modes are similarly enjoyable but inconsistent. They all provide interesting twists on common game modes like Capture the Flag or King of the Hill, but aren’t all equally as successful at it. Unlike other shooters, all of the modes in LawBreakers are score-based with a shared, contested objective and teams competing until one side reaches a certain score limit. It gives an average match of LawBreakers a more recognizable identity, but I was surprised (and just a little disappointed) to see it didn’t have anything like Deathmatch. Uplink is by far my favorite mode. In it, both teams fight over a single Uplink item you can pick up like a flag; plugging it into your base begins charging a meter for your team, but the opposing side can steal it, run it back to their base, and charge their meter instead. The race to charge three times first provides a tense back and forth of attacking and defending that feels like Capture the Flag without having to split your team between offense and defense.   The Occupy mode is also great, forcing both teams to battle for control of a small capture point that rotates to different spots on the map. It’s a King of the Hill-style mode that still enables you to take advantage of LawBreakers’ unique and exciting movement. I also really liked that the next location of the control point would follow a specific order for each level, meaning good players could memorize that pattern and rush to the next spot before the point actually unlocks. When you play on that level you have to think not just about the current point, but the next one as well.  Going a dozen games without seeing a map like Vertigo can be a bit of a bummer when you have no control over it.  In contrast, the Overcharge mode feels like an objectively worse version of Uplink in which both teams share a single meter being filled. That means matches play out identically, but with the added possibility of some truly awful-feeling upsets. It wasn’t uncommon for me to see one team get the objective right away, charge it up to 80% or more, then have it stolen at the last minute. I guess you could say there’s a strategy to that timing, but it was always infuriating when it happened to me and felt cheap when I did it myself. The Blitzball mode is promising in concept but less than thrilling in practice: Each team fights over a ball they have to bring to a goal on their opponent’s side. Unfortunately, it requires more coordination than any team I’ve been queued with could manage, quickly devolving into a smattering of irrelevant fights while clued-in players would just pick up the ball and make a mad, reckless dash for the goal. The mode is nearly saved by Rick and Morty Creator Justin Roiland’s ridiculous voiceover as the game ball itself, but it doesn’t make up for the fact that my Blitzball matches have almost always been a near-shutout for one side or the other.   The occasional stale map or frustrating mode wouldn’t be as noticeable if they weren’t all mixed into a single matchmaking queue. Unless you’re making a custom game, the only way to play LawBreakers is by hitting the “Quick Match” button and hoping the slot machine didn’t stop on “Overcharge/Redfall.” LawBreakers will eventually get ranked play with its own queue, but its presence is already sorely missed. There’s currently no way to filter or specify the maps and modes you want to play or avoid, which is probably the biggest complaint LawBreakers has left me with. Going a dozen games without seeing a map like Vertigo can be a bit of a bummer when you have no control over it. That said, while I initially figured I would quickly get tired of the quickmatch roulette, there’s so much nuance to LawBreakers’ movement that even subpar modes gave me something I could enjoy. In its best game modes, LawBreakers manages to make simply moving around feel amazing. Learning how to fall with style in the most deadly way possible is a thrilling challenge. Getting stuck playing a weak mode and map thanks to the grab-bag matchmaking can be frustrating, but it doesn’t ruin an otherwise fast and tense shooter that lets you gleefully propel yourself through low-gravity with rocket boots and miniguns.
Kallie Plagge	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	 Some spoilers for Undertale follow. I finished my first playthrough of Undertale in stunned silence. My journey had begun with dumb puns and silly puzzles, but the end affected me in a way I never expected. That’s kind of Undertale’s specialty — playing with our expectations of what an RPG should be, subverting them, and using them to drive a story unique to what games can do. Its strong writing, integration of gameplay with storytelling, and acute understanding of its audience all build to something that surprises at every turn.  As a lone human fallen into an underground world that serves as a prison for monsters, I had my journey laid out for me, as most RPG protagonists do. For my first playthrough I took a pacifist approach, being as kind and merciful as possible as I searched for a way back to the surface. But I made a mistake: I accidentally killed a monster in the beginning. So I restarted without saving, as I would in any other game when I needed a do-over. Except… things were different this time. Dialogue had changed to reflect that I’d seen her die. Then Flowey, Undertale’s chaotic evil, fourth wall-breaking flower, tore into me for having the gall to abuse the power of the save state.   Undertale expected me to have played RPGs before and played with those conventions in unexpected ways. That first berating from Flowey shaped the rest of my experience — I learned I couldn’t bank on a soft reset, so I had to tread carefully. Everything I did mattered. That clever manipulation of gameplay mechanics adds weight to a story that couldn’t have been told in any other way or medium. Undertale has to be a game, and that’s the key to its brilliance.  Its dodging-based combat minigames especially rely on that concept. Boss battles consistently subverted my expectations, even after I thought I’d figured everything out, but even run-of-the-mill random encounters are closely intertwined with storytelling and worldbuilding. Every enemy has a unique personality expressed both through combat and non-combative options. In my pacifist run I ended up talking to a lot of monsters, giving out hugs, and even (and especially) flirting with them to avoid killing them. In order to spare a monster that wanted to flirt but didn’t want to admit it, I had to “get close but not too close.” That option changed the rules of combat so that I had to narrowly dodge incoming projectiles… until the monster blushed so much that it stopped fighting. Undertale has to be a game, and that’s the key to its brilliance.  There are tons of jokes that appeal to internet nerds, and I often felt like Undertale was talking directly to me, like it knew what I was thinking. An anime-loving character’s “selfie,” for example, is actually a picture of a garbage can with pink sparkle filters over it (and speaking from experience, this is very accurate). I especially love Undertale’s humor when it has something to say, however subtle. I entered a snail race (called Thundersnail) and was told to press Z repeatedly to encourage my snail to win. I spammed Z until she burst into flames, and the Thundersnail organizer told me that “all that pressure to succeed really got to her.” It was, like many of Undertale’s one-off jokes, extremely relatable — and knowing and predicting its audience is one of Undertale’s biggest strengths.   Undertale’s writing is consistently funny, but it can also be touching. Small, semi-hidden notes and dialogue enrich the world and build on an already compelling story of humanity and morality. A favorite was a series of “echo flowers” in a beautiful, ethereal hallway that repeated snippets of an overhead conversation. A monster didn’t want to share her greatest wish — that one day she would climb the mountain that traps all the monsters underground and look out at the world — for fear of being laughed at, and although her friend promised they wouldn’t, the friend ended up laughing anyway. It was silly, until the last flower repeated: “Sorry, it’s just funny… That’s my wish too.”  Experiencing the depth of the monsters’ hopes and dreams is crucial to Undertale’s exploration of morality, personhood, and conflict. Different monsters talk about each other in front of you, so once I met them I got to discover who they actually were, as opposed to what their reputations suggested. Most of the main characters are also very well developed with consistent personalities across different dialogue and story routes. It made it hard for me to summon the aggression to attack any of them — and that’s precisely the point. When I was trying to go for a more violent run, fighting monsters I’d once flirted with made Undertale’s message about humanity hit even harder.   Some fights can be frustrating or even tedious, however, at least at first. In a violent playthrough, I had to grind quite a bit to meet certain story requirements and grew tired of it after a while. Fighting enemy after enemy replaced the puzzles in the peaceful runs, however, and the tradeoff felt very balanced and ultimately meaningful to the story. I also found myself trudging back through areas I had already cleared just so I could beat a boss or get an item, and while it was absolutely worth it in the end, I wasn't terribly excited to do it. At one point I had run out of gold and needed to buy healing items, and the only shop that would buy items off of me was about a 10 minute walk away. (The other shopkeepers don't buy items because they don't want your trash.)  That said, I don't regret any of the extra time I spent walking around, because I got to find things like Thundersnail and the echo flowers. It's the little details that make Undertale so special, and I wanted to see them all. Every one of them feels deliberate — long sections of dialogue at the beginning and certain fights can be slow, but they are necessary for establishing the characters in a way that only games can do. In a different run, underwhelming boss battles turn mournful because of what one-hit KOs imply in the world. It was Undertale's ongoing, well-woven theme of determination that kept me playing and replaying. Even though the art isn't always pretty — it's often ugly, even — Undertale is an incredibly expressive game from start to finish, making up for visual limitations with excellent music and charming animations. It's also gender- and sexuality-inclusive in a very real, noticeable way. Every small detail reveals an intimate understanding of its audience, and that is essential to what makes Undertale’s commentary on personhood so effective.   By Brendan Graeber After playing through Undertale on PS4, I’m happy to report that everything was ported over to console perfectly (including the clever takes on saved games and more). The only real additions I spotted are on the periphery, like being able to set a background to the centered 4:3 ratio screen, and the dynamically changing art is a nice touch. You can also choose to navigate both the world and in combat using either analogue stick or D-pad. Both work well, but the sensitivity of the stick in certain fights had me preferring the buttons to the stick. It's hard to express just how much I adore Undertale without spoiling anything significant, but that's what I love about it. It tells its story in such a dynamic way, and with such a great understanding of the RPG player’s mindset, that it couldn’t have been told in any other way. It's a masterfully crafted experience that I won't forget any time soon.
Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	" My time with Agents of Mayhem is best summed up by an in-game quirk that still nags at me, even after 30 hours of playtime: When calling in your smart-talking AI-controlled supercar, you can stand in a designated zone and perform a flashy leap into the driver’s seat as it races by. Awesome as that move may be, the car always comes to a full stop once you’re inside, forcing you to accelerate from zero instead of keeping a smooth flow to the action – and this feeling of a great start followed by lost momentum kept coming back to me throughout my time with this superteam-inspired third-person shooter.   Agents of Mayhem does a great job of committing to its homage to TV action hero teams, from its cartoon cutscenes to the core mechanic of instantly swapping between different agents in combat. Forcing you to think about multiple characters and how their abilities work together works well in reinforcing the importance these inspirations placed on teamwork, especially since there’s no option for co-op or multiplayer. Framed as an epic battle of backronyms, it takes place after a hostile global takeover by the evil forces of LEGION (the League of Evil Gentlemen Intent on Obliterating Nations), and MAYHEM (the Multinational AgencY for Hunting Evil Masterminds) steps in to push back the tide. Complete with some damn catchy theme music and “Knowing is Half the Battle”-esque life lessons between loading screens, Agents of Mayhem doesn’t try to hide its love for shows like GI JOE and Knight Rider, or even newer franchises like The Avengers. The destructive world that’s been built around them is a good fit for the diverse cast of heroes and villains that inhabit it.  In this universe Seoul, South Korea became Earth’s hub of technology (not that far-fetched an idea), and it’s refreshing to see an open-world setting that isn’t a major Western city. Being based there also does a lot to establish MAYHEM as a multinational organization, instead of just another band of gung-ho American super soldiers policing the world.  It’s refreshing to see an open-world setting that isn’t a major Western city. It’s unfortunate, then, that such a colorful and diverse city and its citizens are never really treated as little more than just window dressing. Civilian NPCs are basically just extra debris to be blown around a fight, and while there’s technically a lot of stuff to do around the colorful streets of Seoul, that’s all those activities felt like: stuff. Aside from stopping one of LEGION's occasional Doomsday Devices, I never felt any real purpose beyond adding another point to the in-game map or giving me yet another vehicle to clumsily ram off the road. It also seemed like I spent a lot of time in the same copy-pasted, slightly rearranged underground bunkers that serve as LEGION’s bases. Their basic design template is interesting, and both the art style and architecture work well with the cartoon theme, but running through the same steel hallways over and over got old after a while. I felt a similar monotony throughout the main campaign. Of the villains for each ""episode"" (every act of the story is treated as an episode of an Agents of Mayhem TV show), only a couple were all that memorable. They each have their own unique themes – for example, the egotistical pop star, or the cyborg with a God complex – but all of their dastardly plots essentially boiled down to throwing wave after wave of the same seven or eight henchmen at me until they ran out of bodies, followed by a fairly predictable boss battle.    I was willing to bench my go-to femme fatales to experiment. That said, there’s a lot of fun to be had while battling this constant stream of helmeted bad guys, and the multi-character gunplay is as stylish as it is satisfying. Swapping between agents using an instant teleportation tech is similar to switching weapons, and their unique special and super moves offer a fun variety of combat styles to play with. Combined with the litany of unlockable skills, gear, weapons and abilities that the agents bring to the table, deploying your team offers enough options to impress even the most meticulous outfitters.  Do you use Fortune’s Cannonball or Powder Keg specials to cause area damage? Maybe instead you want to focus on her drone’s stun ability, and leave the heavy damage up to another teammate? Or will you instead equip one of the madcap gadgets from your support team – perhaps the Moon Laser (which is exactly what it sounds like), or the one that causes all the nearby pedestrians to explode? There's a lot of enjoyment to be found in figuring out how all the characters fit into your arsenal. I quickly found that the tough-as nails ex-marine Braddock, the tech-pirate Fortune and the rough-and-tumble roller derby queen Daisy were a great team for my play style, but I was more than willing to bench my go-to femme fatales in favor of experimenting with the abilities of each new agent I recruited. Each enemy type makes good use of their abilities in combat, too – adding buffs, for instance, shielding that renders other enemies invincible, disabling my weapons and so on – and helps make the arcadey run-and-gun action both frantic and fun enough that I almost didn’t mind the fact that I was essentially battling the same group of bad guys for hours on end. It took me roughly 25 hours to complete the main campaign and unlock all of the recruitable agents, and it wasn’t until I was well past halfway through that I started experiencing any real combat fatigue.    Special Episodes focus on individual characters' personalities. The strongest aspect of Agents of Mayhem, to my mind, are its Special Episodes™, optional missions that set the main story aside in favor of shining the spotlight on individual agents. I eagerly jumped into each one when it became available, not because these missions are especially memorable – they mostly stick to the ""shoot bad guys in a nondescript underground lair"" formula – but because each one gave me a better idea of who each character is and how the agents relate to one another. Little details, like learning about one agent’s crush on another, or the frozen Russian “Cold Warrior” Yeti’s love of 90s Rap-Rock, helped flesh out each character and really let me empathize with the team. These moments were especially appreciated because while I usually enjoy Volition’s wacky, crude(ish) sense of humor, a lot of scripted moments fell flat for me. It’s not that all the dialogue was overly terrible, but there are constantly stretches of bland exposition coated with a bunch of jokes that didn’t quite land as well as they could have. I found genuinely funny and endearing moments throughout, but for every gag that made me laugh out loud or feel something for a member of the team, there was an equally stale bit of schtick or pop-culture reference. I'm all for having characters that celebrate their own fandom, but some ""references"" were just characters ripping off lines from other movies or shows without acknowledging it, while others were just egregiously outdated (I thought we collectively agreed that the “Imitating Lil’ Jon from Chappelle’s Show” fad ended in 2006). Agents of Mayhem does a good job paying homage to the cartoon and live-action TV heroes of the 80s and 90s, and revels in the absurd tropes and idiosyncrasies of those inspirations. A broad and goofy arsenal of unique weapons and gadgets and the ability to switch characters on the fly to access complementary abilities offers some solid combat and good mindless fun, but due to some unpolished writing and repetitive environments and enemy types, it doesn't fully live up to its heroic potential."
Mitchell Saltzman	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/matterfall-review	 For the first two hours, Matterfall’s exciting, fast-paced action, reflex-testing challenges and unique twists on 2D platforming put it up right up there with developer Housemarque’s best. Unfortunately, two hours is all it takes to beat all 12 levels, and while games like Resogun and Super Stardust are able to thrive past the length of their campaign through chasing high scores, Matterfall’s structure makes earning a place on the leaderboards a chore. Matterfall’s light sci-fi story about a dystopian planet full of robots gone amok is just there to give some light context to exploding hundreds of robots into millions of beautiful bits, which is fine. Housemarque games have always been about the explosions, and Matterfall delivers those in spades. Its twin-stick 2D action-platforming built around two main mechanics: A four-directional dash that can stun enemies and a Matter Gun beam which can detonate screen-clearing Matter Bombs dropped by enemies.   The dash, in particular, is a brilliant mechanic that gives Matterfall its arcadey feel. While dashing you are completely invulnerable, and any enemy hit by the dash and its ensuing shockwave will be unable to damage you for a short time. This allows Matterfall to completely fill the screen with enemies and all kinds of bullet-hell madness without instantly overwhelming you. You’re forced to carve out a path with your dash while clearing out an army of constantly spawning enemy robots.  At its best, the moment-to-moment intensity is fantastic. It’s a style of gameplay that requires you to be extremely active, as you have to think about managing your dash cooldown, what enemies need to be eliminated first, and what projectiles can be dashed through. When Matterfall is at its best, its moment-to-moment intensity is fantastic. In addition to your primary blaster, you can unlock 12 slottable augmentations, including four secondary weapons, by finding civilians hidden in each level, and you can equip any three at a time. Housemarque does a great job of making each augmentation offer a substantial change in how you approach combat. For example, my personal favorite combo involves one that increases the chance that an enemy will drop a Matter Bomb, and one that allows me to detonate bombs by dashing into them, leading to a style of a gameplay that’s focused on massive area-of-effect damage. Or, if you’re the type that prefers a simpler approach of just run-and-gun, there are augmentations that simply increase your gun damage and health.   Matterfall can be a tough game at times because of how much it throws at you at once, but between your dash, powerful secondary weapons, and screen-clearing Matter Bombs you’re more than well enough equipped to deal with its difficulty. It’s in a sweet spot of neither feeling too easy nor too frustrating. The real challenge comes from trying to maintain a high multiplier, since each hit you take knocks your multiplier down a level. And that leads into the biggest issue with Matterfall: it’s just not that fun to replay levels and try to improve upon your high scores. For one thing, restarting a level causes long load times of around 30 seconds, which wrecked the flow of repeated attempts. Meanwhile, many levels are brought down by frustrating platforming segments that slow down the pace and can unceremoniously ruin a good run with failures that are unrelated to the main test of skill of combat. On top of that, levels are just too long and padded by long stretches of running to make score chasing a good time. It’s such an obvious missed opportunity, and the fact that there’s no challenge mode, arcade mode, or a survival mode – any of which would have been a welcome way to take the most exciting parts of Matterfall and condense them into a singular replayable and score-driven experience – just makes it more disappointing. Matterfall succeeds in adapting Housemarque’s trademark style of fast, action-packed, arcadey action to the 2D platformer genre, but it feels like a puzzle half solved. There’s virtually no content here after you finish its exceptionally short campaign, outside of some harder difficulty modes and a global leaderboard to climb, and its level design isn’t well-suited for replay value. It’s a ton of fun while it lasts, but once it’s over it’s hard to not be left with a feeling of “Is that it?”
Heidi Kemps	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	 He’s had his fair share of ups, downs, and loop-de-loops, but Sonic has proven to be one of gaming’s most beloved and enduring icons. With Sonic Mania, Sega brings Sonic back to his classic 2D sidescrolling roots, taking direct inspiration from the 16-bit games that originally propelled Sonic and friends to superstardom. Sonic Mania is proof that no matter how much time passes, great gameplay is always in style. Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles are back to fight Eggman’s forces the best way they know how: running, jumping, spindashing, flying, and gliding their way to victory across twelve zones. You’ll see classic zones from Genesis-era Sonic games, like Chemical Plant, Stardust Speedway, and Lava Reef, alongside all-new areas like Studiopolis and Mirage Saloon. These new zones are particularly impressive: the theming and level design in each is colorful and creative, and I was  eager to run around and explore, finding all sorts of challenges (and easter eggs) within. Take, for example,  the glittering neon lights and electronic contraptions of Studiopolis, an area themed after a television studio in a big city. One route might have you thrust into the guts of a popcorn machine after being beamed around like a satellite signal, while another will send you speeding through the city’s underground subway passages.  But even the old zones are packed with plenty of new tricks. They’re bigger, more elaborate, and filled with traps and gimmicks both old and new that tickled my nostalgia bone and surprised me. Sonic 2’s Chemical Plant Zone was always been a fun romp filled with high-speed tunnels and ramps, but with the addition of chemical jelly goop that bounces you around and lets you cling to walls, it feels fresh and fun in a whole new way. Even the old zones are packed with plenty of new tricks.  The zones aren’t the only things to get an overhaul, either. Reworked Sonic stages look more beautiful than ever, packed with vibrant color and dazzling visual flourishes, while the new zones’ artstyle meshes perfectly with the 2D pixel art of classic Sonic. Everything, down to the smallest of background elements, is more detailed and features more movement than ever before. That goes for the enemies, too -- Eggman’s new “hard-boiled heavies” are depicted with lots of quirky personality, making them interesting and unique villains without speaking a shred of dialogue. The soundtrack is also top-notch, packed with remixes of classic Sonic tunes alongside all-new compositions.  Sonic Mania has all the the crucial elements that go into making a great Sonic adventure: big, elaborate stages, responsive controls and movement physics, interesting and engaging tricks and traps, lots of hidden nooks and crannies to discover, and hazards that challenge you to stay alert and act fast. I replayed many of these stages over and over, finding little nuances and secrets that eluded me the first, second, and even fifth time around. And there is incentive to replay these stages, as there are numerous hidden special levels you’ll need to conquer to collect the Chaos Emeralds and see Sonic Mania’s ‘true’ ending. In special levels, you chase a UFO through a 3D landscape by collecting speed-enhancing blue spheres and rings. It’s a fun concept, but it can be tough to see barriers that block your way on the ground, and collision detection on some objects seems off. Making matters worse, colliding with a bomb can start a chain reaction that sends you careening uncontrollably into other sets of obstacles, which can make otherwise good runs turn bad very quickly. Also returning are bonus stages from Sonic 3, which you’ll find at the checkpoints scattered across the zones. These stages don’t unlock emeralds, but do unlock bonus features once you’ve completed a set number of them, like a sound test, a debug mode, and even hidden sub-games. They started out easy, but grew satisfyingly challenging, and completing them all perfectly took quite a bit of time and practice.  Not every throwback to an old Sonic game is welcome, though. Chances are that if there was something you saw in an old Sonic game, it’s in Sonic Mania somewhere -- even if it wasn’t a particularly good element of an old Sonic game. For example, it’s neat to see a callback to Sonic 2’s Sky Chase Zone, but let’s face it -- the forced autoscrolling and wonky controls in Sky Chase Zone were not very fun then, and they’re still not great now. And that incredibly annoying “keep the lights on” mechanic from Sonic 3’s Sandopolis Zone remains just as incredibly annoying  23 years later. Not every throwback to an old Sonic game is welcome, though.  And while the game’s boss fights are generally pretty cool, some of them have a tendency to drag , like the Studiopolis midboss and a revamped version of Sonic 1’s end boss. I know old Sonic games didn’t have checkpoints between multiple bosses, but it wouldn’t have hurt to have added them to Sonic Mania. And finally -- Sonic’s new drop dash move? It’s a little  weak and slow, and actually pretty hard to use - I stuck mostly to spindashing. (Annoyingly, you can unlock options to use the Sonic CD speed-up and the Sonic 3 instant-shield technique instead, but only in a mode that doesn’t save your progress.)  Still, even when Sonic Mania stumbles a bit, it’s only on little speedbumps in the road. For every issue I had, it didn’t take long before I was  enjoying myself again, eagerly anticipating what sort of wacky wonders the game would throw at me next. It truly is the classic throwback longtime series fans have been clamoring for, but there’s plenty to love here even if you didn’t grow up with a Genesis. Sonic Mania is a stellar example of a retro revival done right.
Samuel Claiborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/mega-man-legacy-collection-2-review	" Mega Man 1-6 found a winning formula and stuck with it, and helped to define the NES’s greatest years. Mega Man’s next four games -- those in the Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 -- may span several console generations but don’t stray far from that original formula. The selection of games in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 is slim: this package only includes four Mega Man games, the DLC for Mega Man 9 and 10, a concept art gallery, and a handful of brand new, remixed stages and boss rush challenges. What links these Mega Man games together, aside from their kooky robot cast and sequential numbering, is their unrelenting, old-school difficulty. In fact, they’re some of the hardest Mega Man games ever made. That’s welcome for old-school fans like me, but Legacy Collection 2 lacks some now-expected features to make it more accessible for modern audiences. In the first first Mega Man Legacy collection that challenge was made a little more forgiving for modern audiences with a “save anywhere” feature, and others, like the Disney Afternoon Collection include a handy instant rewind. Mega Man Legacy Collection 2 doesn’t include either, and they’re sorely missed. You can save your game and return to a few pre-determined spots in each level, and turn on an easier ""Legacy Mode"" that gives you a few more hits per level, but together are still an inadequate substitute. Here’s a quick take on each game in Mega Man Legacy Collection 2:   Mega Man 7 is the weakest game of the bunch. Unlike the twitchy platforming of previous games, the SNES sequel is slow and clunky. Jumps and dodging feel all wrong, and waiting for the charge shot slows things down even more. However, it’s worth playing for the colorful, 16-bit sprites, like this huge polar bear that slaps ice at you. IGN reviewed Mega Man 7 retroactively in 2008.   PlayStation’s Mega Man 8 has aged surprisingly well. It picks up the pace a bit with an awesome auto-fire attachment, and the 32-bit art is straight out of Capcom’s golden era of fighting games. The laughably bad voice acting and cutscenes are more entertaining than annoying. Read IGN's original Mega Man 8 Review (from 1997!) here.   Mega Man 9 is a 2008 retro de-make that apes the graphics and structure of Mega Man 1-6, and it’s the hardest Mega Man ever made. Unlike its predecessors, instant death is everywhere. Bottomless pits, spiked walls, and quickly moving platforms render your arsenal useless. The level design is brilliant, however, and the impossible becomes possible, even easy, after many plays. But without save states, the sparse checkpoints become your biggest adversary. Read the original Mega Man 9 Review here.   Mega Man 10 is a direct sequel to 9, with the same classic look and feel. It adds an easy mode to help you learn the levels, and the bosses are the looniest bunch yet: Sheep Man fortifies his domain with evil mouse pointers and Pump Man pumps his own pump (his head, thankfully). The tunes in both 9 and 10 are top notch. Read the original Mega Man 10 Review here. Especially next to the first Mega Man Legacy Collection’s six games and nicer save system, The Mega Man Legacy Collection 2’s package of four included games is ultimately a step backward. While the games are mostly good, none of them top Mega Man 2 or 3 -- and for the record, I think 3 is the best. 8, 9, and 10 are worth revisiting for a dose of retro platforming challenge, but know what you’re up against going in."
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	" I spent the majority of my six-hour playthrough of Hellblade: Senua’s Sacrifice grasping for a touchstone to understand the experience. It unfolds like a beautiful, dark, tense visual novel, placing the excellently raw, human performance of its main character front and center on her journey into the land of the Northmen. Her story is one of confusion, sadness, fear, and loss, and it’s punctuated by moments of beauty, and strength that has left a lasting impression on me. It follows the titular Senua, a celtic warrior, who embarks on a mission to the homeland of the Northmen in order to penetrate the depths of their version of hell, the mythological Norse land of the dead called Helheim. It's bound by threads of historical fiction, historical non-fiction, mythology, and metaphor all admirably weaved together to create a unique backdrop that's ripe for exploring the darker tones and themes Hellblade tackles.  But as impressive as its story is, Ninja Theory’s smart design reinforces the sensory nature of the harrowing tale through subtle and intuitive mechanics. Even before the game begins, you're prompted to play with headphones in order to capitalize on the binaural audio design (simulated three-dimensional sound). This is used to great effect as the voices that plague Senua are in a constant chatter, dancing around her head in creepy ways that feel as though you're never alone.  Voices that plague Senua are in a constant chatter, dancing around her head in creepy ways that feel as though you're never alone. And in truth, you never really are alone in Hellblade, for better or worse. These voices speak directly to Senua, each other, and perhaps even to you. They impart advice, they argue about her actions, they tear her down and pick her up at the best and most inopportune times. This fact, coupled with the excellent original score, the never-faltering voice work, and the ambient sounds both real and imagined make for an audial experience that's as vivid and liberal as anything that happens before your eyes. Visually Hellblade is a gorgeous game to take in – sun-soaked rocky beaches, vividly distorted streaks of color and light, and deep darkness that strangles the screen, there's a variety of hues, saturation, and exposures that convey meaning in most areas. This variety is further improved when playing on the PS4 Pro, which makes use of an ""enhanced resolution"" or a smoother, more immersive 60 frames-per-second.  And while Ninja Theory is no stranger to including full-motion video in the past (Enslaved's use of Andy Serkis comes to mind), Hellblade's use takes it to another degree by splicing in real footage of secondary characters' performances through a heavily distorted filter that creates impactful scenes between real and animated characters without feeling out of place. I was consistently, pleasantly surprised by the number of ways Ninja Theory was able to present these moments, all without breaking the immersion of the world and story. Its incredibly smart use of audio and visual distortion and trickery to convey the frightening effects of psychosis, hallucinations, and delusion, are married with the gameplay elements for an experience that rarely ever grapples over whether it’s a game or a story.  Hellblade revolves around Senua’s perception of her environment, drawing connections between her beliefs and the geometry of the world. For example, there’s no HUD in Hellblade - yet that chorus of voices shout panicked advice at Senua in the heat of battle. ""Behind you!"" one of them screams seconds before an enemy stabs at Senua's back. There’s no combat tutorial either. Your first moments of do-or-die battle begin without warning. There’s no objective markers or mini map, which are only occasionally frustrating when backtracking to look for the collectible lorestones scattered throughout the world. Hellblade is a game that you’re not supposed to trust, because what you see, or hear, or feel, is rarely truthful. And because of that there are moments of terrifying tension that gave me an amount of anxiety and panic that’s borderline uncomfortable. For example, in one section I guided Senua through a pitch-black area filled with shapeless hair-raising creatures that would lunge out when she got too close. These moments evoke the vibes of a horror game that are sparse enough to be shocking when I haplessly wandered into them, but effective enough that I worried for Senua's safety with that ever-present nagging of permanent death.  Yet most of Hellblade revolves around Senua’s perception of her environment, drawing connections between her beliefs and the geometry of the world. You’ll scour each area, lining up beams, or trees, so the shapes of the world around her take on significance and unlock the next door that blocks her progression. As new puzzle elements are slowly added – like fractured walkways and doors that require a precise viewing angle to be reassembled, or portals that force you to enter entirely different versions of the world – these puzzles take on new layers of depth, and meaning.  These moments are profoundly rewarding when you uncover something new. And many of these moments are profoundly rewarding when you uncover something new – like a hidden path that can only been seen through a specific portal – because they're reinforced by the story that's made all this impossibility plausible. Surprisingly, combat in Hellblade is more of a palate cleanser than a core element. It punctuates the story with wave-based enemies that block progress until defeated, making use of Senua's light attack, heavy attack, parry, dodge, and charge. Though these moves do combine together to create a varied enough skill set when facing the same half-dozen enemy types, progression feels stunted since new abilities only slightly modify the core of the combat, rather than redefine it.  The simple nature of the combat design struck me as obligatory for the sake of interactivity – giving you another way to interact with the world outside of perception – coupled with the fact a warrior should be defined by battle. But there were only a few fights where large groups of enemies were thrown at me that I ever felt threatened and it's only near the end of the journey when enemy numbers and difficulty spike unexpectedly that the combat depth eventually becomes more than the sum of its parts. And yet, like most of Hellblade, combat is still a tense experience knowing that dying too many times (in or out of combat) will cause your save to be deleted and you’ll be forced to start from the beginning. While that might sound draconian in execution, its tie-ins to the story are concrete, reinforcing a system where failure carries meaning rather than simply acting like a gimmick to artificially inflate difficulty. And though I don't think I ever got close to having my save data destroyed, every time I got close to dying carried much more weight and impact with this knowledge. Hellblade: Senua's Sacrifice is a masterclass of atmosphere, storytelling, and the marriage of mechanical and conceptual design. While there are moments that feel shoehorned in to remind us we’re playing a videogame, the care and attention Ninja Theory has clearly poured into Senua and her story has created something amazing. This is a game everyone should play, and I’m thankful for the opportunity to have lived inside the mind of Senua, however briefly."
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	 Countless games try to make you feel like a John Wick-style action hero, a whirlwind of bullets and fists against a horde of thugs that would quickly overwhelm a mere mortal. Superhot VR is one of a very few to pull it off in a believable way. By slowing time in the world around you until you move or shoot, it creates an awesome illusion that you’re thinking and reacting at superhuman speeds. Over a few short hours, Superhot VR’s campaign puts you through a rapid-fire sequence of quick battles where you stand more or less in one spot as bright-red enemies charge you with guns, knives, and fists. If time were moving normally you wouldn’t stand a chance – they come at you from every direction, moving quickly. Even though they stand out clearly against the stark-white, untextured backgrounds, it only takes one hit to kill you, and you’d have to be an actual action hero to avoid them. But as long as you hold still, you have all the time in the world to decide how to handle the situation. It’s not until you move – raising an arm to aim, ducking your head, picking up an object, or firing a gun – that they spring into full-speed motion. That feeling of control is empowering.  Shooting, stabbing, punching, or even shattering bad guys with your mind feels great, and watching them shatter at my feet as I sidestep their bullets like Neo from the Matrix or block them with my own guns, snatch the weapons out of their hands when they get close enough, and deal out precise double-fisted pain is about as rewarding as an action game gets. The fact that a dying enemy will effectively throw his gun at you so you can catch it out of the air and use it against his friends is a very smart way to keep you from having to move too far (which is great if you have a limited VR space), and also feels like you’ve pulled off an amazing move.  I love watching them shatter at my feet as I sidestep their bullets like Neo. The one aspect of the controls that doesn’t feel smooth and intuitive is throwing weapons and random objects within reach at enemies. Timing the release is awkward and tricky to get the hang of, and I’ve had the most success by basically shoving things at enemies instead of the natural throwing motion. But when they connect, it’s awesome to beat a guy with a shotgun by tossing a bottle at his head, or getting one last kill out of an empty pistol by chucking it at someone. Some scenarios are easy, letting you show off by, for example, punching two guys at once as they charge you from opposite sides, or reaching into their chest, making a fist, and yanking out a la Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom. A few have surprising environmental hazards, like a speeding truck you have to avoid. But others are no joke: you’re just as fragile as these glass enemies, which means some levels are pretty tough because even one grazing hit from a bullet will end your run and send you back to the start of a sequence of fights. Unless you’re being extremely meticulous about watching for threats and moving only the bare minimum, you’ll probably catch some bullets you didn’t see coming – it can be especially difficult to see a bullet coming at you straight on, since the red contrail effect behind the tiny black projectile isn’t visible from that angle. Sure, it’s frustrating when you repeatedly die near the end and have to kill the same five guys over and over to get to the trouble spot, Groundhog Day-style, but the quick respawns make it as painless as possible.   Even minimal movement tests the limits of the PSVR’s single camera. Superhot VR is a standing game that usually doesn’t require you to move your feet more than a step in any direction or turn more than 45 degrees right or left – though if you have a room-scale setup, it’ll let you make use of it. However, even minimal movement tests the limits of the PSVR’s single camera, which doesn’t cover a huge area and is difficult to set up in a way that allows you to reach the floor and aim a gun upward at a target on a balcony above you. The bigger issue is the flaky hand tracking of the Move controllers, which led to some unfair deaths. Remember, this is a game where time moves when you do, and if it thinks you’re moving when you’re not, you’re probably going to get shot in the face very quickly. Superhot VR also looks significantly sharper on the Oculus Rift or Vive than on the PSVR, but that’s not terribly important in a game with such a low-detail art style. The short campaign is tied together by a charmingly weird VR-within-VR story that flashes perplexingly cryptic messages at you, posing questions like who’s really in control here and why it chants “super… hot… super… hot” at you when you finish a stage. It never answers any of them, but it’s certainly a unique approach to a campaign that doesn’t take itself too seriously. While each of the stages takes place in a different location, their textureless look makes it easy to miss and difficult to figure out what they’re actually supposed to be unless there’s a major distinguishing feature (such as one fight that takes place on among the passenger seats of an airliner). When you’re done with the story mode, there’s an infinite survival mode in which to test your Superhot skills and rack up as many kills as you can. Smashing your way through endless waves of bad guys until you get cocky and make a mistake is a great way to keep on enjoying this amazing use of virtual reality. Superhot VR’s fantastically clever time-manipulating concept empowers you with the superhuman reflexes of a slow-motion action hero. Shattering waves of glass-like enemies while moving your face out of the path of incoming bullets is a thrilling challenge in both the cryptic story mode and the endless mode that follows.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	" Sundered has a great understanding of H.P. Lovecraft, which by all appearances is the main literary inspiration behind this semi-roguelike 2D platformer in the tradition of Metroid and Castlevania (or Metroidvania). In the 1930s the horror writer claimed atmosphere and mood were the great aims of his ""weird fiction,"" and Sundered delivers both in bundles, weaving that evenly into the minimalist, Limbo-like music or the occasionally stunning hand-drawn set pieces that define this world. Smart sound cues impart tension before trouble arrives. Throughout it all a being speaks with the hero in a voice that sounds like Shakespeare spoken through cabbage with a sore throat, suggesting a Cthulhu-like presence but leaving its form to the imagination. Mood, in fact, is often strong enough here that it can prop up Sundered when it sags. The austere story itself works well in part because it keeps its details close to its chest. Much like Journey, it starts with a lone, hooded wanderer among sandy ruins, but the massive dark arms that pull her down to the underworld hint at encounters with more sinister powers than what Thatgamecompany showed us. Eshe, as she's called, becomes trapped in this strange land peppered with consonant-fetishist names like Klir'luiph'tag'echt Ph'aeshaeglehwgaeyah. It's a similar tale of possible redemption, but one centered more on escape than pilgrimage. It's not always silent—sometimes the Cthulhu-like voice advises Eshe or relates the story's details in cryptic, poetic language whenever you whack glowing black spheres in crystal caves—but it wisely keeps these moments brief. Mood rightly is the star here, and it follows Eshe as she completes the classic Metroidvania tasks in the vein of unlocking shortcuts or encountering shrines granting new abilities like gravity boots and grappling hooks.  Sundered can turn heads when it wants to. Its visual wonders range from the towering statues of wispy robed aliens to the fine details of the hand-drawn smoke from explosions. Yet the bosses steal the show. They're monumental: you’ll face foes like dudes on giant tentacled thrones and ghoulish robotic spiders taking up so much screen space that Eshe seems barely bigger than a stack of pixels (and it's a testament to the strength of the platforming that she's still easy to control). If only there were more screenshot-worthy moments like these. Sundered takes an uncommon approach to procedural generation in that rooms for bosses, shortcuts, and new abilities remain static while the passageways connecting them randomly rearrange themselves after every death. The idea seems sound, but the downside is that these humdrum collections of ledges, tunnels, and pitfalls lack all the personality of their planned counterparts, and the contrast is glaring. Rarely did I sense I was traveling through new territory on second visits, save when the realignment made the trip to a boss take three times longer than it did on the previous attempt. And that's no fun.  Each zone serves as a welcome break from the previous one. Fortunately, there’s some visual variety – you end up working your way through three major zones that differ widely in their aesthetic, ranging from an underground research facility reminiscent of Shadow Complex to a towering cathedral and an underworld where dark tentacles slither from ledges. Each zone serves as a welcome break from the previous one, thanks in part to the environmental quirks in each. In the facility, you have to unlock gates with a massive energy gun, and in the cathedral you parkour up spires while struggling against strong winds and rising putrid clouds threatening to pull you into oblivion.  According to the loading screens, you're supposed to be able to work through these levels in any order you choose, save for some spots that are locked behind ability gates requiring discoverable items like the gravity boots, dash, and grappling hook before moving onward. (Annoyingly, Sundered's map doesn't hint at which abilities the locks require, which means you could make the long trip to try out the lock for nothing if you've forgotten the layout since your last play session.) I found, though, that there's a clear progression in difficulty from the facility to the Cthulhu caves to the cathedral, and I wasted many hours preparing to fight one tough boss because I kept missing the passage to the easier ""first"" one.  Sundered is a hard game, to a degree that isn't apparent at first. Yes, hours. Sundered is a hard game, to a degree that isn't apparent when you make your first forays into the depths and slice individual monsters. But that illusion of an easy fight shatters quickly. Enemies spawn randomly in Sundered, which means you'll withstand everything from long periods of comparative silence to harrowing battles with hordes that unrelentingly swarm you from all directions. This constant threat keeps Sundered at once exciting and frustrating. Forget the individual monsters: the gongs and screams that herald a horde's approach deliver Sundered's true moments of horror, particularly when you've spent 10 minutes on a precarious climb up a cliff and are many minutes away from the safety of the central hub. ""Not now,"" I'd find myself pleading. ""I've come so far."" This chaos of combat can be fast-paced and frantic fun. Fully upgraded, Eshe can both dodge enemy attacks and harm enemies by rolling, and Sundered offers few greater pleasures than lining up a row of monsters and blasting them with a huge cannon. But it can also be a little too chaotic. In the thickest hordes, the animations and effects fire off so closely that it's hard to tell what's happening, which gets especially annoying when cultists cast floating bombs near you when you’re already practically buried under baddies. The battle covers them so completely that I often didn't even see them at all until they went off. At their worst, horde fights essentially devolve into blind button mashing. Inevitably, I died in some of these pileups, and it happened more often than felt entirely fair. That said, the only real punishment for death is the often long trek back to the spot where you were, if you want to return at all. All enemies and treasure pods drop shards that you use as an upgrade currency, but you keep them at death rather than dropping them as in Dark Souls. Death, in fact, is a convenient way of getting back to the hub so you can use the shards in the ability tree, a sprawling affair which branches leading largely to passives for everything from greater melee damage and stronger shields. The skill tree is also where Eshe can equip up to three perks dropped from bosses and mini bosses, which generally provide situational advantages and neatly allow for shifts between shard farming and other combat modes. Some are better than others, of course. One, which restores Eshe's precious shield each time she kills an enemy, seems all but indispensable. I like the design, as I found it always made those less-than-fair failures a little more bearable since I knew my next trek through would be a smidge easier from the upgrades. At the same time, unfortunately, the approach allows Sundered to devolve into a bit of a grind in its comparatively weak middle hours. Sometimes, as in the hidden floating bombs, Sundered can feel a little unfair, but it's never unmanageable. But Sundered offers another option to make things easier: a chance to use the Elder Shards that drop from bosses to exchange part of Eshe's humanity for augmentations to her core abilities. One mutation harms enemies that hit her shield; another lets her drift across long spaces in the guise of a gargoyle. It's both a roleplaying hook — the ending changes depending on how many shards you destroy or consume — and an interesting decision that alters gameplay, in that destroying the shards keep things more challenging. Someday I may even replay it to see what happens if I destroyed all the shards. After 20 hours of this madness, though, it's time for a break. Sundered takes the 2D Metroidvania platforming formula augments it with some successful ideas that all but reward you for dying. Its procedurally generated levels are hit and miss, as the dynamic parts come off as bland in comparison to Sundered's impressive hand-drawn areas and epic boss fights. In addition, its randomly appearing enemy hordes sometimes lead it to devolve into mere button mashing and random deaths, but the knowledge that I’ll come back a little stronger each time makes it hurt less."
TJ Hafer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/pyre-review	 Watching Pyre’s emotionally gripping story unfold, precisely and enjoyably punctuated by exciting, tactical, real-time battles, is to witness just about everything I look for in a video game executed all but flawlessly. Developer Supergiant’s latest is an experience on par with watching a world-class musician perform a difficult piece with equal parts talent and soul. And speaking of which, the music is superb. The intricate but easy to follow story casts you as the Reader, an unseen character flung into the center of momentous events that are shaking the foundations of a finely crafted fantasy setting best described as some kind of beautiful cross between Dr. Seuss and H.P. Lovecraft. Like Bastion and Transistor, it’s an imaginary world where the dark and the whimsical mingle like they’ve always belonged together, subverting familiar stereotypes and treating lore nerds to layers and layers of detailed, expertly penned history and legend to uncover.   Interactions take place in a delightfully hand-drawn overworld. Your task is to put together a kind of mystical sports team to compete in an arcane ritual called The Trials, which are the only way for criminals exiled to a bleak frontier called the Downside to earn a pardon and return to the shining Commonwealth from whence they came. Interactions with the diverse, lovable, many-layered party members and the constellation of memorable opponents and side characters who surround them take place in a delightfully hand-drawn overworld that you navigate via something approaching a visual novel, similar to the style of the campaign of a Fire Emblem game. Choices you make here will uncover elements of your comrades’ pasts, steer your journey down branching courses with meaningful consequences, and ultimately decide both the course of the world above and the one below. Branching storylines have become common in games, but it’s rare that one integrates momentous, gut-wrenching choices with the other elements of its gameplay as deftly as Pyre does. It’s hard to explain exactly what I mean without spoiling some large parts of the story, but I’ll share an example of how a choice I knew I would one day have to make became the emotional heart of the experience for me – even more so than the main plot. Rukey Greentail is one of your first companions and quickly became my star orb-runner in The Trials, with his speed and agility forming the cornerstone of my playstyle. The strategies I’d developed all had him at their center. He was my secret weapon. But by chance, while following an optional objective on our travels I overheard Rukey praying to the stars for something he really wanted in his heart of hearts. Something I felt like I would be a monster to deny him. The catch? Granting him his wish would remove him from my roster forever. I struggled with the decision mightily through many Trials, and of all the earthshaking choices I made throughout the last act, the one that left the greatest emotional impression on me had to do with Rukey’s wish.  It’s so masterfully plotted, setting up situations where gameplay considerations must constantly be weighed against tugs at my own heartstrings. And the number of ways each character’s story can go had my head spinning with the possible paths I could follow in my next playthrough. Between all of the fates I could choose for certain characters over Pyre’s 20 hours and a Mass Effect 3-style progress tracker that determines how well your ultimate plan is enacted, the number of possible endings seems expansive.  The Trials feel more than a little like a fantasy world version of NBA Jam. If the outstanding choice-focused visual novel portion was all Pyre had to offer and conflicts were resolved with simple dice rolls, it would probably still be an amazing game. But instead, we get The Trials: a hectic, highly tactical, real-time battle system that feels more than a little like a fantasy world version of NBA Jam in which the object is to have one of your three characters run or throw an orb into the enemy pyre until their points are depleted. It’s sort of like a combination between football and basketball where the ball carrier is vulnerable to “banishment” – being removed from the match for a short period of time – by coming into contact with an enemy player’s aura (which varies in size based on their stats) or being hit by a special attack. The trick is that while there are three characters on a team, you’re only able to move one at a time. This gives rise to a whole range of tactics based on positioning your inactive teammates to passively defend your pyre by obstructing the other team. There’s no lack of diversity, visually or mechanically, when it comes to the playing fields. Some have moving obstacles or blocks that can be pushed around to create a makeshift defensive perimeter. Others feature chasms that must be jumped, flown, or teleported across. One even pits you against living mobs that move around semi-randomly to make it difficult to plan your plays with any kind of certainty. Strategies and players that seem useless on a flat field can rise to all-star status depending on the terrain, making knowing when to use them crucial. And each arena has a unique visual personality, from the volcanic, imposing Nest of Triesta to the angelic and stately Fall of Soliam where the campaign’s ultimate challenges, the Liberation Rites, take place.  There's a MOBA-like range of interactions between opponents. Each of the eight characters you can recruit in the campaign has highly differing mobility, aura size, respawn time, and special abilities, which makes for a MOBA-like range of interactions between opponents. Small, fast characters like Rukey can outmaneuver an enemy team easily, but typically don’t deal as much damage to the enemy pyre for scoring a goal as their larger, slower counterparts like the bull-horned Jodariel. Some characters can fly over the heads of the enemy, forcing them to make well-timed jumps to prevent a goal. Some can block off areas of the field with deployable aura totems, while others can explode or teleport short distances. The possible team compositions are many, and the tactical considerations add depth and meaningful challenges to each match – especially considering each of the nine other teams competing in The Trials has its own set of unique players and strategies. Depending on the opponent, arena, and your playstyle, you might plant two defensive characters with large auras on your pyre as living barriers (placing them close together combines their auras) and have a single speedster solely responsible for ball-running - but since a character who just ran a successful dive doesn’t respawn for the next round, this means having to count on the fact that you can out-score the enemy team with a roughly even number of goals, or somehow score with one of your tanks when you’re a man down. Creating an aggressive squad that blitzes down the field by passing the orb back and forth frequently is vulnerable to having it snatched by a flying character who can go on to score behind their backs. The campaign even features a number of handicaps you can unlock at the start of a match that grant you more experience, and make up for the fact that the AI, while it puts up a good fight, just can’t compete with an experienced human player. Everything about The Trials feels precise, strategic, and exciting. There’s a 1v1 multiplayer mode with the ability to play against bots or other humans that allows all of the compositional diversity of the story campaign and then some. One of my only disappointments with Pyre was discovering that the head-to-head mode is local only, so you can’t challenge your steam or PSN friends across the world to a match. This is a shame, because the mind games and unorthodox strategies you can develop and run into playing against another human bring The Trials to another level of tactical depth and tests of reflexes.  Sneaking in that final goal to win a match by inches when my own pyre only had five health left was the kind of tense moment that made me stand up from my desk and run my hands through my hair, wondering if I could start parading around the room cheering without my roommates calling the cops. These close victories are made even more gripping in the context of the campaign, where the outcome of a match could decide the fate of a character you’ve come to know and love.  It’s all wonderfully united by a common mood. Behind all of that, Pyre delivers exactly the heartbreakingly beautiful instrumental and vocal backing tracks that Supergiant has become known for. Each song feels even more integrated into the story than in Bastion and Transistor, with each enemy squad you face having its own stylistically distinct but tonally consistent theme. The main theme is twangy and aspirational, whereas one group of enemies that is basically a pack of bloodthirsty talking dogs are heralded by aggressive, ‘80s-style electric guitar rifts. Another cadre of opponents, malevolent witches who worship evil beings hinted at in the lore, bring a spooky, somber, atmospheric motif along with them. Yet it’s all wonderfully united by a common mood that evokes a fallen world trying to be better. The art, likewise, never ceases to impress. The character designs are imaginative and expressive, from the hulking, curly horned demons to the quirky, goblin shopkeeper who sells trinkets to boost your team’s performance in The Trials. The variety of surreal, dreamlike landscapes you’ll travel through in the Downside look like they were pulled from a children’s book and then tweaked to be just a bit darker, just a bit weirder, to the point of coming across almost foreboding. Likewise, each arena in which The Trials take place has a vibrant and unique character, in addition to varied terrain that must be accounted for in planning your tactics. From the art to the music to the story to the tactical gameplay, and even to how they’re all woven together so artfully, Pyre is an adventure that excels in every area of its design other than limiting its multiplayer to local only. It’s an epic journey that made me feel thrilled, devastated, and awed, and its tense moments had me tugging my collar both in and out of its fast-paced mystical sports arenas. With an emotionally charged ending that saw so much I’d striven for come to fruition, but was still tinged with tragedy and melancholy even when I did almost everything right, I won’t be able to get Pyre out of my head for a long time. This is Supergiant’s best work to date, and that’s saying something.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/20/black-the-fall-review	 You'll be forgiven if you look at a screenshot or video of Black: The Fall, rub your eyes and, for a moment, think you're looking at Inside. In fact, I spent my first several hours of playing Black a little angry at the gall it had to so blatantly follow in Playdead’s footsteps. Some of that faded away as it introduced a few ideas of its own, but Black never comes close to living up to the comparison it forces you to draw. Who knows if Black was in development prior to Inside's release or not, but in coming out a full year later, one can't help but compare one to the other. Like Inside (and I mean exactly like Inside), Black: The Fall is a monochromatic side-scrolling puzzle-platformer where your nameless protagonist is dropped into a massive, gloomy industrial complex full of gruesomely lethal traps with no context or explanation whatsoever. Black does, at least, add a couple new wrinkles to its puzzles: early on, you’ll acquire a laser pointer used to take control of enemies or cause distractions. Soon after that, you get a robot dog sidekick who you’ll need to solve some of Black’s more difficult puzzles and is The Fall’s most interesting gameplay hook. Those puzzles run the gamut from dead simple to multi-layered challenges. It’s a good mix.  The times I did get stuck, the solution usually ended up being some subtle environmental interaction I’d just mistaken for part of the background rather than a failure of puzzle-solving logic on my part. Also, its rough animations and mediocre graphics stand out more than normal because you can’t help but compare it to Inside’s near-perfect polish. Again, Black makes it all but impossible not hold the two up, side-by-side. Though Black deserves credit for adding new puzzle mechanics along the way, it could’ve easily seen its 6-8 hour runtime chopped in half and still gotten its message across. That entire time I found myself wondering if, like Inside, Black would have anything to say. When I finally discovered its message at the end of the campaign, it did inspire me to look up the real-life issue it was drawing attention to and learn more about it. I applaud it for that. Sure, it could’ve done so with a bit more subtlety – it's a bit heavy-handed at the very end – but at least Black does have a point to make. It’s just a shame that it wrapped that in a game that’s so shamelessly and distractingly derivative.
Heidi Kemps	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	" The original Final Fantasy XII was a great game that came out at the wrong time. Launching on the PlayStation 2 distressingly close to the release of the PlayStation 3 and Wii meant that it was overlooked and underplayed by many. Those who did stick with it, however, were rewarded with a superb RPG adventure, filled with beautiful visuals, an engrossing world, and a unique free-roaming approach to exploration and combat. Now Final Fantasy XII is back as The Zodiac Age on PlayStation 4, polished with a high-definition coat of paint and a host of minor – but mostly positive – changes, giving players both old and new a second chance to experience the world of Ivalice. Final Fantasy XII’s refreshingly down-to-earth story focuses on the struggles of characters caught up in a web of politics and war, rather than a stereotypical cataclysmic “saving the universe” sort of JRPG adventure. The focus on the characters and their small but important roles in a larger struggle makes the various twists, betrayals, and triumphs of the story feel more impactful. It’s helped along by one of the best localizations ever, which makes reading reams of dialogue learning more about the world feel rewarding on its own. This is a game where I thoroughly enjoy talking to each and every NPC, which is especially impressive when you consider that a playthrough can range from 60 hours to over 100, depending on your pace.   While the story is linear, the world is semi-open and allows you to explore large portions of the map from the beginning with only a few restrictions. Wandering off the beaten path can yield rewards like treasure and high-grade loot, but it also offers the risk of wandering into the territory of high-level monsters who can easily eat your party for lunch. The rewards for exploration are manyfold: areas that look like dead ends can contain noteworthy treasures, high-level enemies might drop loot that opens up new items for sale in the bazaar, and secret bosses lurk in totally optional areas that you would otherwise completely pass by.  FFXII cleverly alleviates the problem of CPU-controlled party members behaving badly. Combat takes place directly on the map and is an interesting variation on the real-time, menu-driven battles of previous Final Fantasy games. You only control one party member at a time – the other characters are all directed by the CPU. Thankfully, Final Fantasy XII cleverly alleviates the problem other RPGs have of CPU-controlled party members behaving badly through pre-programmable commands called “gambits” which let you direct characters on how to act when certain situations arise. For example, you can tell an ally to use healing items and spells when your characters are hurt or suffering status ailments, target high- or low-hp enemies, or use elemental skills when an enemy vulnerability is known. Set up your gambits well frees you up to spend your time focusing on more interesting things like positioning in order to maximize area-of-effect attacks, while still issuing extra commands to your comrades when necessary.  ""]  It forces you to give every character a distinct purpose in the party. All of that is virtually identical to the original version of Final Fantasy XII, but one of the biggest and most meaningful changes in The Zodiac Age is the complete revamp of the progression system that determines everything from the armor you can equip to the skills you can use. Called “License Boards,” these grids open up things like passive skills, magic spells, and weapon and armor equip abilities through spending points you earn. In the original version of FFXII, every character could unlock all of the potential skills available on their license board, which made different characters play very similarly over time. With the revamped License Boards of The Zodiac Age, characters instead pick two boards (from a pool of 12) that correspond to classes like Knight and Black Mage, each of which has a more limited and specialized skill grid. While this makes potential skill pools far more limited than the original version, it forces you to give every character a distinct purpose in the party, and that prompts you to be more thoughtful and creative with both assigning classes and spending license points. Another new addition is the Trial Mode, an optional challenge that puts you in a brutal rush of 100 consecutive battles, starting from the easiest sewer rats and ending in a fierce run of free-for-alls against the most notorious foes in Final Fantasy XII. While you can try it at any time, it’s designed primarily as post-game content – you’ll need an incredibly high-level party, some fast reactions, and a carefully selected array of gambits and skills in order to succeed.  ""] Final Fantasy XII has also received quite the visual overhaul for The Zodiac Age. While it’s more of a high-res texture remaster than a full-on HD remake, it still looks amazing, filled with breathtaking vistas and fantastic creatures -- a testament to how strong the original game’s art design was. A gameplay speed-up function (either double or quadruple speed) also makes things like wandering through towns or farming loot in areas with easy-pickings low-level foes less of a chore. While most of the additions and enhancements are very good, there are also quite a few missed opportunities to improve various interface issues the original version had. For example, the speed-up function is nice, but it still feels like a chore to wander through a big city to get to a particular location at any speed. Why not add fast-travel in towns instead?   Other additions don’t feel well implemented. For example, you can press L3 to get a full map overlay of the current area you’re in – but there’s still a chunk of screen real estate in the upper right being taken up by a redundant area minimap even when you turn this on. Also, while most of your funds are earned through looting items from monsters, you still have to manually sell these items one by one at the store, which is more time-consuming and tedious than it needs to be. Perhaps the most egregious oversight are the hunts: Finding the clients and areas where hunts take place is still a royal pain in the butt, as they aren’t marked on your standard questing map even when you have acquired information on where things are located. It’s understandable that some monsters should be trickier to hunt down than others, but if I’m told it’s lurking in a particular area, why shouldn’t my map reflect that knowledge? Final Fantasy XII’s relatable roleplaying adventure has aged remarkably well, and The Zodiac Age remaster improves it further in meaningful ways. The storytelling, visual design, and gameplay feel just as fresh and interesting as they did over a decade ago, and the various new enhancements and adjustments will give new players a chance to experience the magic for the first time and fans of the original something enticing to return for."
Joseph Bradford	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	 As I drop out of hyperspace flight, the whine of my engines resonating throughout the cockpit of my Cobra Mk III spacecraft as they screech to a halt, a Methane Dwarf star stares back at me. The purplish light of the star bounces off the dashboard of my spacecraft, filling the area with a melancholy glow. This peaceful moment leaves me awestruck as I take it in, making me hesitant to move on to the next leg of my journey. Elite Dangerous is a game full of drastic swings between peaceful, poetic moments like this, others that are full of danger and action, and some of the most boring stretches of empty space I’ve ever navigated. Though this deep and vast space fighter sim has been out (first on PC and then on Xbox One) for a few years now, Elite Dangerous has finally brought its 1:1 scale model recreation of our Milky Way Galaxy to the PlayStation 4. At least in this version of the 3rd millennium, this is a place rife with political intrigue, trading empires, space fighter combat - all separated by  tracts of empty light years. Elite Dangerous can be played fully solo with just the stars to keep you company, or it can be played  online in its Open Play mode. The latter is a persistent online universe where you’re constantly bumping into other players, known as Commanders, but interacting with other players is pretty limited. You can group up and run missions, trade routes, or simply explore together, but the vast majority of human interaction boils down to piracy and bounty hunting.  It’s up to you, Commander, to decide how to start. What’s not easy, however, is learning how to play Elite Dangerous. The learning curve is tough, especially when it comes to piloting your craft or simply trying to figure out what the heck to do next. Sure, you start off with tutorials teaching everything from basic flight, combat situations, and even landing procedures (the bane of many commanders’ experiences), though those can only go so far. Once you jump into the shared online universe for real, however, you’re thrown into the cockpit of a basic Sidewinder spacecraft, in a space station, orbiting a planet in a random star system with no direction as to how to proceed. It’s up to you, Commander, to decide how to start. I suggest searching YouTube for some starter guides, because otherwise Elite Dangerous risks blowing its precious first impression on its deep trading system, or even to learn more about the political struggles which hang over every corner of civilized space. This level of freedom is often teased in open-world games, but with Elite Dangerous it’s fully realized. You can become a prolific trader, capitalizing on trade routes between stations and amassing millions of credits with each trip you take. If piracy is more your thing, more power to you: you can hunt down unsuspecting pilots, steal their cargo, and sell it to some shady dealer in a fringe system, risking bounty hunters in every flight. If you enjoy the solitude and simplicity of traveling light years beyond the borders of civilized space you can explore the unknown, bringing back cartography data of a far-off star no one has heard of before. Some will be content to simply stick to one role the whole time, but I realized early on that I was going to bounce between play styles depending on my mood. I found myself mostly specializing in trade with the occasional bounty hunting when the constant travel started to wear on me. Wisely, Elite Dangerous doesn’t put any barriers in your way when you want to change things up.   Elite Dangerous becomes increasingly satisfying. There is no overarching campaign to complete, though there are political intrigues and storylines to be found in every starport. It's up to you how to shape these stories, good or bad. It’s daunting, especially to those accustomed to a more focused space adventure like No Man’s Sky - which is open world but had a defined goal to work towards at the end - or Wing Commander. But as each layer is peeled back, the gameplay of Elite Dangerous becomes increasingly satisfying, leaving me with the feeling that even the time spent traveling from one dot on my heads-up display (HUD) to another isn’t entirely time wasted. I find it fulfilling to pore over trade data I’ve logged, maximizing the route to take in order to make the most money off a trading haul. I also love to study the Galaxy Map – a dizzying display of systems, trade routes, and power struggles – in order to find potential conflict zones I can take part in. Some of these moments can be a challenge to enjoy, though, since the PlayStation 4 version suffers from some pretty crippling performance issues, even after the patch that cleaned up the frequent screen tearing. Most severely, framerates plummet when blasting into a busy star system or arriving at a large, complex space station. The latter causes further annoyance since these issues mess with the responsiveness of the controls, making landing safely (which is difficult under the best conditions) a struggle not against game mechanics, but input lag.   Learning how your ship handles in stressful situations can go a long way to surviving. It helps that Elite Dangerous is one of the most beautiful space games I’ve played. The inside of each ship’s cockpit is intricately detailed, with a level of care usually reserved for racing sims. Effects - such as the lessening of light pollution as you move away from a nearby star, making nebulae, stars and more become more visible as you continue to fly away - are subtle, but help to reinforce this convincing sense of place. Each spacecraft handles distinctly, from the quick and speedy Eagle to the slow and lumbering Hauler, and learning how your ship handles in stressful situations can go a long way to surviving in the long run. The biggest part of that is combat, which also feels great. Combat in Elite Dangerous isn’t just a “point and shoot” affair. Each instance is different, bringing with it a bevy of on-the-fly decisions that can make the difference between winning and ejecting into cold space. One time I dropped into the system of Eravate and immediately headed to the Nav Beacon, and was greeted immediately with the sight of a group of players and AI ships alike engaged in a space battle with a poor soul sporting a pretty large bounty (which you build up through acts of piracy). I’d upgraded my ship a few times since starting out, so I sent my Cobra Mk III into high gear to engage and collect a portion of the spoils. Soon I was staring down a large Anaconda-class ship and settled in for a bumpy fight.  My Cobra’s hardpoints lashed out, sending beams across the enemy ship. His did, too, and my shields were gone in what felt like an instant. Shields gone, I had to figure out how to survive against this massive ship while staying in the fight. I kicked my throttle into gear and performed a quick-axis turn by turning flight assist off, keeping my eyes on the enemy while moving out of range of its weapons. Thankfully, a ship upgrade I made in the previous station meant my shields recharged faster, which allowed me to get right back into the fray. Throttle still fully engaged, I turned back on flight assist to stabilize my fighter as I set my ship's power to focus on its weapons, and gave it everything my beam weapons could. Its shields were now down, and with the Anaconda weakened I used my cannons and multi-guns to tear apart its hull ‘till it met its demise. A bounty of 201K credits flashed across my heads-up display, ready to collect at the nearest starport. Even with all these moments in mind, though, it is hard to shake the fact that for much of your time spent in Elite Dangerous will be spent traveling in essentially a straight line - whether from port to port, system to system (or even planet to planet with the $30 Horizons DLC). It’s easy to fall into a routine, but that routine largely becomes dull and uninviting. Thankfully, Elite Dangerous on PS4 launches with the Arena mode, giving a reprieve from the mundane moments of interstellar travel. The game modes in the CQC (or Close Quarters Combat) Arena are nothing to call home about when it comes to objectives: you can take part in either team or free-for-all deathmatch, or a capture the flag mode. But the constant action keeps me engaged. Within the Arena, there is a separate progression system: you’re not bringing in your incredibly outfitted ships from the main game, but ranking up and unlocking new ships, weapons, and items to take into combat. Ranking up doesn’t take too long either – within about five or six deathmatch rounds I found myself with a few unlocked ships and loadouts to rival some of the better fighters in the Milky Way, which left everything else to a test of pilot skill. Space is big and empty, dotted with small points of brilliant light. Elite Dangerous is much the same way: it can at times be boring or mundane, as much of it is spent flying from point A to point B. Thankfully, whether you’re soaking in the cosmos around you, banking large sums of credits from a well-planned trading haul, or surviving a harrowing encounter with space pirates in dazzling ship-to-ship combat, Elite Dangerous has plenty to keep me excited to come back. And when those long-haul sessions become too much, Arena mode is there to inject some much-needed action at a moment’s notice.
Jonathon Dornbush	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review	 As someone who played the first three Crash Bandicoot games over and over again, the Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy delivers exactly what I wanted. The platforming, for better and occasionally worse, retains the demanding, and punishing challenge of the originals coated in a polished, modern sheen that makes even the most familiar levels feel fresh. And just as Naughty Dog’s original trilogy sucked me in years ago, Vicarious Visions’ remakes have me itching to collect every crystal, gem, and relic yet again. That’s in large part due to the impeccable technical work Vicarious Visions has done in retaining the tough but rewarding platforming of Naughty Dog’s original trilogy, while drastically updating everything around that foundation.   The HD visual upgrade isn’t a matter of smoothing over some rough edges and tweaking lighting. All three entries have the glow of a Saturday morning cartoon, with jungle foliage more lush, fire and water effects more dazzling, and futuristic cityscapes glowing with — though never distracting enough to make me lose more lives — and everything from futuristic city scapes to temple ruins glow with a beauty I didn’t expect.  The visual updates matter to the gameplay as well. And Vicarious Visions has smartly made the visual update matter to the gameplay as well. Enemies who may have previously been difficult to read now have better tells that don’t rob the experience of its difficulty. I can remember angrily throwing my controller as a kid after encountering the flamethrower-toting lab assistants of Cortex Strikes Back or the spiky-headed lizards of Warped. The remakes improve on their designs, however, to make any of my deaths absolutely my fault, not the game’s. The trilogy sounds better than ever too, thanks to an HD update to Crash’s soundtrack, which has always been an infectious earworm of drums and marimba. While not the exact same tracks as the original game, the new score captures the soul and energy so well that I seriously need this soundtrack on its own now. But it’s the little touches that really impressed me this time around. The way the patter of Crash’s footsteps changes from sand to concrete, or Polar’s yelps mixing with the cries of whales bring the wacky, weird, and beautiful levels to life.   Even with the facelift, the original Crash Bandicoot is easily the weakest of the bunch. Crash’s limited moveset allows for less intricate, and interesting levels. And the overreliance on waves of enemies rather than platforming challenges makes for a much more repetitive experience, especially when put side-by-side with Cortex Strikes Back and Warped. There’s still fun to be had with the original entry, though, and it’s easy to see the solid foundation on which the next two games were built. And Vicarious does include some needed quality of life tweaks like box counters and time trials that make for a more fleshed out experience. But for those jumping into the trilogy for the first time, the original Crash won’t leave the best first impression.  Cortex Strikes Back stands the test of time as the best of the three. Having years to reflect on them and returning now to the trilogy in this new form, Cortex Strikes Back endues as the best overall package. There’s an excellent blend of truly challenging core platforming and extra objectives — secret levels, Death Routes, and extra gems all make a return. The second entry offers a smart balance of maddening difficulty but also makes me feel that overcoming every obstacle will take just one more try — even if it really takes a dozen more. But I always knew any lives lost in Cortex Strikes Back were due to my ability, not some cheap enemy or poorly laid out jumping challenge. Naughty Dog also clearly learned lessons about depth and structure in between the first two Crashes. I often found myself misjudging the distances for a jump in the first game, while I never had that issue in Cortex or Warped.   That better balance epitomizes what made these games such great platformers over a decade ago, and what has allowed the second and third entries to stand the test of time. The trilogy rounds out with the also-fantastic Warped, which doesn’t strike quite as great a balance between design and difficulty. Levels like Future Frenzy and Tomb Time are a blast to explore, with more crates to smash and a smarter pace to the obstacles peppered throughout stages. But they’re never all that difficult — as much fun as it is to play through longer, more labyrinthine levels, they’re never quite as punishing as Cortex’s levels. That’s in part due to Crash’s upgraded arsenal. It’s fun to have a double jump, extended spin attack, and a wumpa fruit rocket launcher, but they can make collecting additional gems and even just completing levels a breeze. The challenge comes mostly when Warped switches things up, particularly with vehicle levels. Coco’s aerial levels are boring, with the task of shooting down blimps or fighter planes offering almost no difficulty. The real struggle comes, however, with Crash’s underwater and racing levels. Swimming in Crash becomes frustrating because of how loosely he controls underwater, making minute movements almost impossible as he drifts through the water. And for all my love of Crash Team Racing, its roots in Warped with certain racing levels are a chore to play thanks to stiff steering controls.   The N. Sane Trilogy delivers one OK experience and two great ones, and they’re all made better by Vicarious Visions enhancing the solid foundation Naughty Dog created years ago rather than trying to drastically change it. There’s plenty of great material to discover for those playing for the first time, and hints Vicarious Visions has added to loading screens never feel like a cheat but instead a simple gesture toward more obscure aspects, like death routes or colored gems, that makes them more understandable. Added time trials to Crash 1 and 2 offer plenty of new challenges for veterans, though, and as someone who spent hours whittling down my speedruns in Warped years ago, I found myself immediately doing the same with the first two Crash games. The last major addition comes in the ability to play as Crash’s sister Coco, which amounts to a fun but superfluous addition. She’s charming to watch kick butt and keep a level head as opposed to her wackier, older brother, though she never required me to change how I approached levels. She’s functionally identical to Crash, but with an entirely different set of animations that can be fun to discover and compare while playing. I didn’t want the Crash Bandicoot: N. Sane Trilogy to break what wasn’t broken. Thankfully, Vicarious Visions clearly didn’t want to either, and the studio’s reverence for the original maddening yet rewarding challenges that still remain fun is clearly on display. On one hand, that leads to the frustrating limitations of the original Crash Bandicoot persisting 20 years later. But it also results in the incredible visual and aural overhaul and the gameplay tweaks to earlier entries, like time trials and crate counters, that Naughty Dog added later in the series. Those additions make the overall package so much more cohesive while never forgetting what made, and what still makes, so much of Naughty Dog’s original trilogy a blast to play.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	" ""Revolution"" is such a nice, punchy word. Generally, it's even a positive word, or so we're generally led to think as we're on the ""right"" side of a bevy of revolutions ranging from the American to the sexual. But let's be honest—change isn't always good. However noble intentions may be, sometimes a revolution ends up making things worse than they were before. And that, sadly, appears to be what happened with Valkyria Revolution. In a wider sense, the ""revolution"" here would be the act of yanking the Valkyria series away from its tactical origins in order to create something that's better described as a Dynasty Warriors-style RPG. The approach never works quite as well as it should. Valkyria Revolution has a rather fascinating narrative premise as its foundation, but all developer Media Vision builds on it are overlong, weakly animated cutscenes with frequent loading screens and a merely moderately enjoyable combat system. It's possible its weaknesses grew out of a need to make Valkyria Revolution less graphically intensive to accommodate a simultaneous release on the Vita, but the approach makes the PS4 version I played suffer greatly for it.  In outline, at least, the story's fascinating. It takes place in an alternate timeline from the Valkyria Chronicles series proper, which--well, more on that later. This, appropriately, is the tale of the tiny nation of Jutland's revolution for independence from the Ruzhien Empire (read: Russia) and it's framed as a conversation between a student and his professor a century in the future. The professor tells the ""true"" story of war as opposed to the version that's been accepted by history, and it cleverly lets you revisit old cutscenes by looking through the professor's scrapbook. The revolution clearly worked out well for Jutland, but this prosperity grew out of the schemes of the so-called ""five traitors"" who orchestrated world events partly out of simple revenge for injustices suffered at their orphanage when they were young.  In outline, at least, the story's fascinating.  The problem, then, is not so much the content of the story but how it's told. Valkyria Revolution often feels as though it's three-fourths painfully bad cutscenes and one-fourth gameplay. Some of these cutscenes drag on for as long as 15 minutes, but only rarely does the action rise above watching a bunch of characters standing around a table with nothing moving but their mouths. Often you won't even see the speakers speaking as the camera's pointed at the back of their heads, as though to save on even that degree of animation. Also, you either have to sit through the whole cutscene or skip it entirely: there's no option to skip over lines of dialogue if you've read the subtitles faster than the character speaks them. Adding insult to injury, an endless parade of short loading screens interrupts the flow as one cutscene transitions to another. All this, all while the characters are spouting politics that sounds as though it was ripped from accounts of Europe on the verge of the first World War or Bismarck-era Germany. Even as a degree-holding historian, I found the presentation often couldn't hold my attention, and I find this especially shameful since Valkyria Chronicle's somewhat realistic World War II elements were so appealing. The action-oriented combat doesn't do much to make up for it. It has its moments, particularly when you jump into the midst of a enemy bunch of soldiers with Amleth – he of the imitation Buster Sword – and cut them all down in one tidy swing. And generally, I'm a person who prefers big swords to big guns. But gosh, it's repetitive, regardless of whether I'm in many story missions or in the ""free"" missions I too often found myself grinding for stay strong enough to handle the story missions. But there's very little in the way of variation: It's always about jumping into maps with often low-resolution textures, plowing through a bunch of bad guys, and then beating a boss. The ability to switch between up to four squadmates of different classes makes battles a little more interesting, as do the flashy animations that contrast so starkly with the stodginess of the cutscenes. Yet outside of those moments you start to see the many other flaws, such as the way sidearms like rifles feel almost worthless compared to the big melee weapons wielded by the heroes. The AI can be moronic, with squadmates outright ignoring collective orders or running off to fight distant enemies. As for the enemies themselves, each new one rarely looks much different from the last, and they all stand around waiting for you to hit them. In appearance and in action, the setup reminds me of nothing so much as the enemies in the MMORPG Star Wars: The Old Republic.  The AI can be moronic, with squadmates outright ignoring collective orders  Magic was in short supply in Valkyria Chronicles, but here it's everywhere. After all, the reason the Ruzhien Empire wants Jutland in the first place is that the Jutish folk have a massive stash of ragnite, the substance that powers all this magic. The resulting spells add spice to the combat with fireballs or causing tremors to erupt beneath enemies' feet, and Revolution tries to wedge in a dash of Chronicles' tactical combat by forcing you to press the triangle button every time you use them to stop combat. Like so much about Revolution, it's a nice touch in theory, but the constant juggling ruins the flow of combat.  On top of that, an ""emotional"" combat system attempts to add depth by lowering enemy defenses by striking fear into them with swift surprise attacks, but it rarely seems beneficial enough to warrant tactical consideration. Valkyria: Revolution drowns in this shallowness. Unlike Valkyria Chronicles, there's little to distinguish it from the mass of generic Japanese RPGs already available, and at times it almost comes off as a parody. It's entertaining enough, partly thanks to the broad strokes of its story, but it's also eminently forgettable. So much of what made the Valkyria series great — the cel-shaded, hand-drawn art style, and the roughly realistic world where magic feels almost as otherworldly as it would in our own — gets cast aside in favor of 3D models that would look more at home in Star Ocean and magic that's as common as booze in a frat house. It's a revolution that's better read about than experienced. Valkyria Revolution tells a decent tale of war, but the strength of that story is dulled by overlong, boring, and poorly animated cutscenes. It sacrifices the unique historical setting and art style of the Valkyria Chronicles series proper in favor of generic JRPG elements that fail to leave a strong impression, and its hack-and-slash combat offers little in the way of strategy and ruins its own flow with an poorly matched magic system."
TJ Hafer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/23/nex-machina-review	 When a top-down shooter like Nex Machina comes along, I’m reminded that even in this age of procedural open worlds and emergent storytelling, you don’t need a lot of buzzwords to have a good time. Its five stages of simple, fast, sometimes frantic bot-blasting can be daunting to the unprepared. But when I got a good run going, the responsive controls and exciting, sci-fi graphics made my frustrations with its sometimes nasty death penalty worth it. Each stage is divided up into rooms where you have to defeat several waves of robotic enemies, optionally saving defenseless humans to increase your score, before proceeding to the next. The baddies are both visually interesting and clever in their design, and every world introduces new ones so the combat never feels repetitive. Like in one of developer Housemarque’s previous games, Resogun, saving the human hostages adds a sense of urgency and encourages you to take risks and get aggressive.  One of the main twists that separate Nex Machina from the typical top-down shooter is that as you progress through a level you’ll accumulate a set of power-ups that can come in any order. These include increasing your weapon spread, granting you a single-hit shield (normally you die from taking a single hit), and upgrading your dash from a speedy escape tool to an attack that deals explosive damage. Getting fully powered up is fun and rewarding, but it lacks variety since a fully powered-up character always has the same set of abilities in each of the five levels.  Getting fully powered up is fun and rewarding The way the powerups work with death also lends itself naturally to a sort of failure spiral that I wasn’t especially fond of. When you die, you drop one power-up and have to get back to the place you died to recover it. Corpse runs are a fine challenge, except that if you lose all your lives and are forced to use a continue, you lose all but one of your power-ups. That creates some ridiculously tough situations because the difference between a full brace of power-ups and none at all, especially on some of the stage bosses, is absolutely night and day. More than once, this forced me to restart a level because I died at or just before a boss, after having slogged through over a dozen extremely challenging rooms, and simply didn’t have enough mobility or firepower to have the slightest chance of coming back from that to win. It’s a sort of artificial spiral that punishes you for failure with more failure, making subsequent attempts more difficult than the first, which doesn’t make a lot of sense. Expect a lot of restarts to get that one, perfect run on higher difficulties.  The art really steals the show from level to level, acting as a bit of a balm on the grind of getting demolished over and over as you learn the ropes. Each environment, from the depths of a smoldering volcano to a brutalist, dystopian cityscape, has a strong sense of personality and is filled with little details that add to the ambience without becoming distracting. The enemy designs are simple but effective, with distinct silhouettes that let you quickly distinguish which ones are dangerous in which specific ways while there’s utter chaos unfolding all over the screen. The explosions for the various special weapons and death animations for bosses and minions are also highly satisfying, and supported by impactful sound effects. Depending on the difficulty level and your own skill, it might take you anywhere between three and 10 hours to beat Nex Machina’s arcade mode, in which you play through all the levels in order. But beyond its first playthrough, it’s set up to be a great platform for challenge-seekers and high-score chasers. The most interesting of these is arena mode, which challenges you to complete a single level with some kind of modifier (enemies are sped up, or having to complete the level in a limited time), awarding you bronze, silver, and gold medals for meeting certain score thresholds. You’ll also be ranked on a global leaderboard for each challenge and earn XP to level up your profile, all of which seems like an exciting way to engage the community with an ongoing quest for bragging rights. Despite the frustrations its upgrade system often caused me, I had a good time navigating Nex Machina’s array of twin-stick shooter challenges. The appealing art, energetic soundtrack, and pixel-perfect gamepad controls made me own every failure and look forward to whatever might come next. Arena mode seems to be where most of the lifespan on this one will come from, and I look forward to seeing people who are better than me at it pull off some crazy runs to climb the rankings. Nex Machina is not for the faint of heart, but a recipe to delight those looking for an attractive, arcadey challenge to overcome.
Darry Huskey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	 Tekken 7 is a love letter to this long-running franchise and its staggering complexity. Yet somehow it still manages to be accessible to just about anyone wanting to mash buttons, and its huge amount of customization unlocks constantly give you something to strive for beyond its silly and slightly cliched story. In a pretty good time for fighting games, with Injustice 2 knocking it out of the park, Killer Instinct continuing to give us quality content years after its release, Street Fighter 5 hitting its stride after a rocky start, and a new version of Guilty Gear Xrd air-dashing our way, the King of the Iron Fist Tournament will not be outdone. On the surface, Tekken 7 is familiar, taking place on the series’ signature three-dimensional stages which allow you to move to your opponent’s sides as well as forward and back. Attacks are inspired by Asian martial arts and other fighting styles from around the world, placing most of the emphasis on strikes and very little on the projectiles you typically find in other fighting games. Movement is more deliberate, and carelessly jumping or dashing can be disastrous.  The introduction to Tekken 7’s pace comes from The Mishima Saga, the ambitious new story mode created for the console and PC versions (as opposed to the arcade). The Mishima Saga explores the healthy and emotionally stable relationships within the Mishima clan, where sons are obsessed with murdering their fathers and fathers can’t help but throw their sons into the nearest lava pit. Heihachi, his son Kazuya, and his grandson Jin all maneuver trillion-dollar corporations with militaries more advanced than most industrialized nations while trying to take each other out. While The Mashima Saga does attempt to portray Heihachi in an understanding light by giving motivation for his infamously chucking Kazuya into an erupting volcano decades ago, it is hard to find sympathy for any of the scions of the Mishima family.  There is a certain charm to the entirely over-the-top nature of Tekken’s lore. However, there is a certain charm to the entirely over-the-top nature of Tekken’s lore and its embracing of anime tropes, and the short character-specific chapters included in The Mishima Saga help lighten the mood while also serving up nostalgia. When King battles Jack, Jack uses its artificial intelligence to adapt to King’s fighting style, so the famous luchador uses maneuvers borrowed from his long-time friend Marduk and from his rival Armor King. When Yoshimitsu attempts to infiltrate the Mishima Dojo, he finds Leo and battles the young girl before having a change of heart and catching a knee in the groin for his troubles. While it certainly isn’t sophisticated, I feel no shame admitting watching Yoshimitsu crumple to the ground had me chuckling while smiling and shaking my head.  The Mishima Saga takes an approach similar to the story mode in Injustice 2, changing points of view between Heihachi and his progeny, Tekken Force rebel Lars, and special guest Akuma - yes, that Akuma. I found this approach to the story slightly frustrating in Injustice 2, as being thrust suddenly into the boots of a new character meant I had to stop to learn them, and the same could be said of Tekken 7 and The Mishima Saga. However, Tekken 7 does offer the ability to use simplified inputs while playing The Mishima Saga to perform a handful of pre-selected attacks, easing the transition into playing a character with whom you might not be familiar. Also, while there are multiple points of view, there is a manageable number, so I didn’t need to spend a huge amount of time learning moves in order to progress. At the same time, The Mishima Saga’s short, three-hour duration and slimmer cast made the events of the story feel important only to the Mishima clan itself, rather than all the fighters in the King of Iron Fist Tournament. Other fighters are given a brief time in the spotlight with optional side missions contained within Mashima Saga mode. While I found some of these, such as Yoshimitsu’s ill-fated excursion into the Mashima Dojo, entertaining, I was slightly disappointed to see so little focus on anyone other than Heihachi, Jin, and Kazuya and their struggle for power over the Mishima Zaibatsu and one another.  Tekken 7's customization options set a new standard. Where Tekken 7’s content does not disappoint at all is in its character customization options, which put it truly in a class unto itself and sets the new standard for letting you express yourself. Cosmetics are modifiable on an unparalleled level, going beyond thousands of individual fashion pieces to include attack effects, colorful auras, portraits and tile backgrounds, and multiple alternate costumes whose top and bottom pieces can be mixed and matched. You’re even allowed to choose from hundreds of options for the frame art around your health bar; it’s something so simple, yet it adds another cool way to make yourself unique when playing online.  Extra content is unlocked by completing matches in online Tournaments, Treasure Battle, or by spending Fight Money, which you earn simply by playing. The sheer amount of content in character appearance alone would give a completionist a hell of a lot of fights to finish in order to collect all the hats, shirts, accessories, costumes, and alternate artwork. Hwoarang starting up the Superkick Party in a Bullet Club t-shirt? Too sweet. These alternate looks partner up with an often-overlooked element to the Tekken characters, which Tekken 7 delivers: even old faces look new, rather than sticking to the tried-and-true costumes and designs from previous games. Hwoarang has an eye patch. Lars wears new armor. Heihachi sports a samurai-inspired look. King looks heroic in a cape. While characters like Street Fighter’s Ryu and Sagat, King of Fighter’s Iori, or Guilty Gear’s Slayer and Sol have classic, iconic looks, I appreciate that Tekken takes a chance by reimagining the visual design for even their most veteran names. When I see Yoshimitsu wearing armor that looks like it was designed by H.R. Giger, I know I’m playing Tekken 7.  Tweaks have been made to encourage newbies. Underneath the excellent cosmetics, some tweaks have been made to the combat mechanics that should encourage newbies. (If you’re a newbie you might not understand this – but that’s okay, you don’t need to benefit from these changes). Relative to the phenomenal Tekken 6, sidestepping here is slower and not as useful for baits or defense, while forward and back movement is improved. This places more emphasis on short and middle ranges, which feels more comfortable for those approaching Tekken from experience with spacing-focused games in Street Fighter or King of Fighters. While sidestepping is slightly less useful and no longer a universal weapon against certain characters who lack strong tracking attacks, careful and expert usage can still open up opportunities to capitalize on mistakes. It also helps characters with traditionally slower sidesteps like King or Paul to not feel so disadvantaged in defense.  New damage scaling has reduced the amount of damage longer combos do, with launcher damage down from Tekken 6 and total damage dropping sharply from the fourth hit of a juggle onward. However, continuing to practice combo execution is a must, as wall-carry combos are still crucial even if they aren’t doing as much damage. The changes are slightly more forgiving for the newer faces among us who might throw out a poke only to whiff and find themselves getting severely punished. The movement and damage changes are a smart way to encourage people to learn Tekken 7 without sacrificing the complexity that is the series’ trademark.  Tekken 7 is the best the series has ever been. Rest assured that this is still, pound for pound, the most technical fighting game on the planet. While the combo system has been changed to be more streamlined by replacing traditional Bound bounces from previous versions with Screw Attacks, there is still ample opportunity to get lost exploring the artful flow of each match. Scaling changes mean most of a combo’s damage is front-loaded, forcing difficult choices. Do I punish with a down-forward 2-leading into a longer combo which will carry me closer to the wall, or do I get in some damage with a shorter combo off an up forward 3? I found optimizing my performance to be a near-zen exercise of evaluating conditions, making changes and choices in mere moments accommodating distance, scaling, positioning, health, and even the stages themselves. No other fighting games master imparting a feeling of each fight growing organically, living and breathing like Tekken, and Tekken 7 is the best the series has ever been. Perhaps most admirable of all, despite the ultra-demanding execution required to master Electric Wind Godfists or to visually recognize frame advantage and know the difference between a 12-frame and 14-frame punish, Tekken 7 still manages to be something you can pick up, press buttons, and play. No matter who you are or what your skill level, you can always just pick ole’ Eddie and start tapping away at the kick buttons. It’s the push to take your skills to the next level that requires you to immerse yourself in Tekken 7’s intricacies. The action goes down with a soundtrack of drum-and-bass bangers so awesome it left me disappointed when I fired up Spotify and came up empty-handed after a hopeful search. The main menu theme, “Solitude,” sets the mood from the moment you fire up Tekken 7.  “Empty Your Mind” from the Dragon’s Nest stage, “Metallic Experience” from the Mishima Building stage, and heck, even “The Motion” from the Warm-Up Space had me nodding my head along with the beats and beatdowns. Quality music would be enough, but Tekken 7 takes it an impressive step further by including the soundtracks to every single Tekken ever released (including both Tekken Tag Tournaments) and allowing you to substitute in any of your favorites or to create a custom playlist of your favorite songs from old Tekkens and the new one. Including all the Tekken music is a cool touch and marks a reoccurring theme within Tekken 7 of celebrating Tekken as a whole. [Note: this Jukebox Mode is a PlayStation 4-exclusive feature.] You can use your Fight Money to purchase marketing and concept pieces, original art, and all the video cutscenes for every Tekken. This is a nostalgia motherlode, and viewing some of this material quickly pulled me back in time to memories of years spent with Tekken, whether hours of matches of Tekken 3 with friends in high school, countless quarters sank into Tekken Tag Tournament machines, or getting destroyed repeatedly by the Bay Area Tekken scene when other Street Fighter players and I tried to transition into Tekken 6. Online multiplayer between strong connections has been smooth with minimal frame delay, though we've seen some weaker connections drop during matchmaking. On a whim, I accepted matches on mid-ranged connections with players from Asia and was pleasantly surprised to find that, while latency was not as low or steady as more local matches, the fights were still enjoyable. Certain characters do require unforgiving execution within a short window of frames, such as the Mishimas with their infamous Electric Wind Godfist, but Tekken 7 helpfully allow you to practice in Training mode while simulating the delay you would expect at various connection strengths. Tekken 7 truly is a hallmark, a fighting game crafted with obvious affection. It strikes a fine balance between accessibility to series newcomers and retaining much of its technical traditions. The soundtrack is an electronic treat, and while the story can at times seem a bit cliche, the fact that it never takes itself too seriously lets it bring in a tremendous amount of flexible character customization. Its dedication to the details helps push it into the position of my favorite fighting game of 2017 so far.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	" Stepping onto the bridge of the USS Aegis in Star Trek: Bridge Crew is a dream come true for a lot of Trek fans. It lets you experience the fantasy of manning a Federation starship with three of your friends (or solo, awkwardly), and like most multiplayer VR games it’s hilarious to mess around with as you learn how things work. But by the time I gained beyond a cadet’s level of understanding of its systems, it became clear that there’s virtually no depth to this simulation. The attention to detail on the two bridge sets is great, from the captain’s chair to the consoles and the viewscreen. Some liberties are taken with the Aegis’ control panels to make them more video game-friendly than what we see in the modern Trek movies, but the Original Series Enterprise bridge is impressively accurate. I wish I could get up and wander around the bridge – or the entire ship, really – and take it all in, but you’re unfortunately glued to your seat in one of the four positions.  Using the virtual touch-screen controls in front of you feels awesome – while you can play with a gamepad if you don’t have Oculus Touch, Vive, or PlayStation Move controllers, you’d be missing out on a big part of the experience of reaching out and touching Star Trek. Considering there’s no panel there in real life it feels a little more like Minority Report’s holographic controls than Star Trek, but that’s cool too. The one thing I found frustrating was the captain’s chair buttons, which are clustered together so closely that it’s easy to accidentally call a Red Alert when you’re trying to answer a hail.  Bridge Crew isn’t really about serious simulation in the first place. Character models and effects (like the fires that start around the bridge when you take damage) are a lot less attractive than the ship itself and don’t do much to help immersion. But Bridge Crew isn’t really about serious simulation in the first place – it feels more like an elaborate theme park ride. Sure, you can do some hardcore roleplaying if you like, but in my experience playing with both friends and random matches the mood on the bridge quickly becomes that of a comedy. Especially during the first couple of times playing through the handful of available half-hour missions, Bridge Crew is a little bit magical – it’s like living out a classic Star Trek blooper reel where Scotty forgets to turn on the warp drive, Chekov can’t figure out how the shields work, and Spock’s head turns around almost 180 degrees. Because many of the basic work of operating a starship is made up of multi-part tasks, elements of which are divided between stations, there has to be a fair amount of interplay between crewmembers. The engineer has to charge warp coils before the helmsman can engage, the tactical officer has to scan an anomaly so the helmsman knows whether to avoid it, and whoever’s operating the transporter can call out how much longer they need the shields to remain down. That creates good roleplaying moments even among people who aren’t into that sort of thing. (Nerdy side note: for all of the technical accuracy in this game it's bewildering that it refers to short warp jumps between locations in the same solar system as ""impulse."" That's not how that works!)  However, communication is frequently interfered with by some unreliable Uplay voice chat, which has a really bad habit of cutting out seemingly at random, causing a lot of “What was that? You cut out after ‘Set course for…’” and “I can’t hear anybody right now. Just gesture at me if you need more power.” Talking with the same group over Discord was flawless, though Bridge Crew won’t let you completely mute the in-game chat. That makes it basically impossible to use an alternate VOIP service. The silver lining is that Uplay allows you to play with any Bridge Crew owner, be they on Oculus, Vive, or PSVR.  Combat is disappointingly simple, and that's most of what you do. About 80% of what you’re doing in Bridge Crew’s missions is combat with Klingon ships, or trying to steer around enemies in low-power mode to avoid detection. And while it’s not always easy to win, it’s disappointingly simple, especially relative to older Star Trek combat simulations like Bridge Commander or Starfleet Command. There’s no need to rotate through phaser arcs as they charge because there’s only one. You don’t have to keep your strongest shields toward the enemy or try to hit their weakest ones because there’s only one shield strength number for your whole ship (and there’s no way for the engineer to recharge them in combat, either). There are few enemy ship types to deal with and no significant difference in how to handle them: scan them, disrupt their systems (which can disable shields, weapons, or engines for a few moments), and fire away. The most complexity I’ve seen is when you disable a larger Warbird’s weapons while going after a smaller Bird of Prey to quickly reduce the number of enemies firing at you. And in multi-ship battles, there’s no way to coordinate with other Starfleet ships, so you can’t even prioritize targets effectively. Another issue is that most of the job of combat falls on the helm and tactical positions: helm steers and keeps enemies in your 180-degree phaser arc while tactical scans and fires phasers and torpedoes. The captain, meanwhile, has very little to do except shout out ideas for what they should do and hope the crew feels like following orders. Even when you answer a hail and talk to an ally or enemy captain on screen, there’s never a dialogue choice or decision to be made. The engineer has the job of allocating power to different systems, at least, but that station doesn’t even have a sensor screen to see what’s going on (presumably so that you have to listen for your crewmates calling out for more power). You also have to repair systems, but that involves little more than a lot of watching progress bars fill up, with no opportunity to feel like a miracle worker.  If there’s so little for each player to do, it seems like a missed opportunity to not have minigames of some kind to pass the time while those progress bars fill up, such as subsystem targeting, transporter lock-on, or system repair – all of which have been represented on screen in various Star Trek movies and episodes.  You can play everything completely in single-player. You can, of course, play everything completely in single-player, or with less than four, by jumping between seats and giving broad commands to an AI crew. It’s totally playable, and I was able to beat most of the campaign solo, but I’ve found that going in with any less than two makes the power and systems juggling required in combat and especially stealth a hassle. I was detected a number of times because my helmsman wasn’t smart enough to avoid an enemy ship on his own. It’s also a shame the AI crew won’t respond to voice commands (you have to use a contextual menu to give them orders) though Ubisoft says there will soon be an experimental trial using IBM’s Watson technology to allow them to respond to conversational orders. After the campaign are the Continuing Voyages, which are randomized versions of the same defend, rescue, and research missions. The randomization doesn’t add much to it, though – even though you’re warping to different locations on the star map you’re still only ever going to find one of a few different types of encounters when you arrive there. And while some of them have pitched battles with three or four Starfleet ships going at it with even more Klingons or pirates, others have next to nothing between you and the anticlimactic ending. These are getting old quickly, and playing as the TOS Enterprise bridge doesn’t help – I love the nostalgia and loyal depiction, but using the old physical switches to navigate and target enemies is just a worse way to play. There have also been some bugs, which I will describe in terms Star Trek fans can understand. One, which I call the The Next Phase bug, froze our controls while a Federation ship fought Klingons on its own. Both ships were unaware of us until one player dropped, snapping us back into reality. In another, our captain’s sensor screen showed Klingon warships directly ahead, but the helmsman and tactical officer showed clean scopes. He was declared to be hallucinating and removed from command (which you can’t actually do, so we all quit out to the menu and restarted). Let’s call this one the Shore Leave bug. Star Trek: Bridge Crew feels like a promising first draft of a fantastic Trek simulator, but it only goes boldly for a few hours. After the novelty of finally sitting on a beautiful Federation starship bridge wears off and you’ve exhausted the handful of mission types, all that’s left is the goofy physical comedy of messing around with your friends or strangers in VR. That’s nothing to scoff at, but with such a basic combat system and so much time spent twiddling virtual thumbs in two of the four chairs, Bridge Crew’s needs a refit before it’ll be ready for anything close to a five-year mission."
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/danger-zone-review	 On paper, Danger Zone looked set to be a Burnout fan’s dream come true. In it, Burnout’s original creators would take a fresh crack at the gameplay that defined their careers – all while the actual Burnout IP collects dust on EA’s shelf. And while it does perfectly recreate the memorable Crash mode from a gameplay mechanics perspective, it omits almost all of Burnout’s summer-y, tongue-in-cheek personality, and alternate modes. The result is a bare-bones game that’s good for a few hours of fun, but lacks staying power. Danger Zone does indeed only consist of one mode: Crash Testing, which includes 20 Crash Test Junctions. Each Junction is an intersection you launch your car into at high speed, and they have to be approached strategically to inflict maximum damage and collect as many power-ups as possible. Who should you hit first? Where should you fling your car using the mid-air Aftertouch controls after triggering your Smashbreaker explosive? All that experimentation makes it feel more like a puzzle game than a racer. Know too that you’ll fail, and fail often; the Retry button will get a workout. And though loading times aren’t too bad on PS4, they’re just not quite quick enough to be painless.  When you get a good run, medals ranging from bronze to platinum are awarded based on your score, with built-in leaderboards serving as a passive nudge to keep you playing for a higher cash total. And that’s...about it. There are no new cars to earn. Plus, there’s no summary screen to give you a big-picture look at how you’re doing across the three Test Phases that make up the campaign, there’s no soundtrack to speak of, and every junction is set inside the same drab, gray concrete virtual simulator. With no sunshine, no busy, realistic metropolitan intersections, and (I can’t believe I’m saying this) no DJ Stryker, Danger Zone just comes across as lifeless.  Furthermore, the lack of car deformation is disappointing. Sure, your ride will get scuffed, scraped, and scarred to Hell and back, but the lack of proper damage modelling – in a game purpose-built for crashing cars into other cars – is quite unfortunate. Though, to be clear, it nevertheless remains fun to smash into cars and cause giant explosive pile-ups. It’s as if Danger Zone, taken as a whole, simply reanimates Burnout’s body but can’t bring back its soul.  Danger Zone is a simple and barebones game that manages to recapture some of the car-smashing action of the classic Burnout series, but not enough of the joy. Though Burnout’s Crash mode was always the star of the show in those games, it turns out that Road Rage, Burning Lap, etc. defined Burnout just as much as Crash did, as well as its personality. Their absence here is felt deeply, though to Danger Zone’s credit it’s priced accordingly at just $13. As such, it’s worth a look for Burnout veterans, as long as you calibrate your expectations appropriately.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	 On the surface, Rime is a gorgeous, melancholy adventure of a lone wanderer in the similar fashion as memorable games like Ico, Journey, or The Witness. But just under that layer of beautiful art, mysterious locations, and wonderful music, is a game with very few new ideas. Instead, almost all of its puzzles are shallow and ultimately uninteresting versions of things we've seen and done in other, better games. Rime's basic premise is simple and familiar: you wake up on a magical island after a shipwreck, and have to solve a variety of environmental puzzles over the course of the six-hour adventure to piece together just what the heck happened. Your nameless adventurer character doesn’t have a ton of personality beyond looking like a cross between Ico and the main character of Journey, but your guide through Rime is little magical fox who’s just about the cutest critter ever. He doesn’t do a whole lot, but he helpfully points you in the direction you should go in – which I found especially useful in knowing where not to go if I wanted to explore everything in an area before progressing.   As you jump, climb, and swim across the beautiful and varied world, you’ll complete rudimentary tasks like collecting keys, moving crates, and carrying around battery-like orbs. Those puzzles generally feel more like household chores than challenges you actually have to think about, and rarely have that much-appreciated “aha!” moment of revelation. The only exception are a handful of hurdles that involve interesting uses of light, shadow, and perspective. But even when I was bored by what I was doing, I never got tired of looking at Rime. Each area of the island is beautiful in its own right, brimming with color and style. Much like the island in The Witness, Rime’s dreamlike art and architecture made spending time in the world a joy, and the absence of a HUD meant that every frame of my adventure was enjoyable to look at. That said, the lack of cohesion between the four areas makes the whole thing feel like series of separate levels, as opposed to a single place with a real sense of identity. You leave a lush, green forest, wait through a load screen, and suddenly emerge in a sun-drenched barren wasteland, with no transition in between. And while you can wander a bit off the beaten path in search of various collectibles, these never reward you with more than a JPEG on a menu screen.   While I enjoyed exploring the world in an aesthetic sense, I wasn’t so keen on some of the design and performance issues. Even though the art style is fairly low-detail, the framerate became choppy on a pretty regular basis on PS4, even during cutscenes. The camera seemed to occasionally get stuck in strange places, particularly in underwater swimming segments. And I found myself far too often having to complete banal climbing challenges that required no critical thinking to solve the problem. I have to admit that the mysterious allure of Rime's story definitely had me hooked, though, and I was compelled to see what was at the end of the winding road. While the payoff wasn't quite as satisfying as the endings of some of Rime's clear inspirations, I appreciated the open-ended nature of the world and its inhabitants for allowing me to come up with some of my own answers. But at the end of the day, neither those questions nor the answers were enough to make Rime a memorable experience after the credits rolled. Rime’s superficial beauty and interesting mysteries provided enough enjoyment to make me willing to put up with its shallow and familiar elements under the hood. While nothing about Rime is necessarily bad, you can find more interesting versions of nearly every single element of it in other, better games.
Mike Rougeau	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/farpoint-review	 Farpoint is one of the first games developed for PlayStation VR that feels like more than a tech demo, a proof of concept, or a traditional game with VR features slapped on as an afterthought. That works to its advantage, because while it would be a mediocre shooter if you played it on a normal screen, in VR it feels good, especially when you play with the new PlayStation VR Aim Controller. Like any good VR game, Farpoint makes concessions for the limitations of virtual reality. For example, in story missions enemies only ever come at you from the front, which lets you play the whole game without having to turn around much. By traditional shooter standards it’s boring design, but in Farpoint it helps stave off the motion sickness some people experience in VR and avoids issues with moving outside the bounds of where the PlayStation Camera can detect you or your controller (which can be a DualShock or the gun-shaped Aim). And unlike something like The London Heist or Until Dawn: Rush of Blood, Farpoint doesn’t feel like a simplistic shooting gallery because you can move around its environments freely. There’s also a wide variety of foes that behave intelligently in combat, and big levels that encourage you to pop from cover to cover as your enemies gain ground and try to flank you.  If you’re comfortable in VR and want an extra degree of control, you can fiddle with the options and enable using an analog stick to turn left and right. If you can stomach it I strongly recommend choosing the “smooth look” option. That becomes more or less necessary in Farpoint’s challenging co-op missions, but even VR lightweights should be able to handle the campaign.  What makes Farpoint noteworthy is the phenomenal feel of its gunplay. What makes Farpoint noteworthy is the phenomenal feel of its gunplay. There’s a deeply satisfying rhythm to handling these guns, and you see their intricate moving parts clicking and sliding as you methodically empty their chambers, tap the reload button, and physically tip the Aim Controller up and back toward your shoulder to swap back and forth between your two equipped guns. But the highlight is hefting the surprisingly light Aim Controller (or a DualShock, clumsily) up to your face and closing one eye to line up your weapons’ sights feels intuitive, snappy, and natural – it’s better than any other shooter I’ve played in VR. The precision rifle and shotgun in particular feel like a match made in heaven, perfectly complementing one another as you snipe distant jetpack-wearing aliens and pull the shotgun out in panic when leaping spiders pop out of the ground in front of you. With a utilitarian rocket-equipped assault rifle and a less useful alien plasma rifle and spike launcher (very much in the vein of Halo’s Needler) rounding out the selection Farpoint could have used more weapon variety, but it nails the basics so well that it’s easy to recommend for that alone.   The story ends so abruptly I was surprised to see the credits. At around five hours to complete, Farpoint’s story campaign doesn’t overstay its welcome. As you fight to rescue a pair of scientists stranded on an alien world the story takes some predictable turns, mostly conveyed through awkward fixed-perspective cutscenes. Those are well written, but watching a video doesn’t play to VR’s strengths. Then it ends so abruptly I was surprised to see the credits start rolling. Farpoint also feels unfinished in other, stranger ways, like in its poorly thought-out menu interface. If you select the first mission the opening cutscene doesn’t play, and if you select the cutscene directly it simply plays all the cinematics in order and skips all the gameplay sections. To play the full game again from the beginning – if, for example, you want to show Farpoint off to a friend – you have to select the opening cutscene, watch it, then quit back to the menu and select the first mission, waiting through multiple lengthy loads. That can be chalked up to clumsy interface design, but other issues popped up that definitely weren’t done on purpose: at one point I had to close the game due to a reoccurring bug that made my whole view go totally black, and when I opened it back up I’d been sent back several checkpoints, like it hadn’t saved. Yet I was stuck equipped with the spike launcher I’d picked up later in the level, which was terribly ill-suited to the sniper-filled canyon I had to fight through first. With literally no way to simply restart the entire level, it was a huge pain to catch up to where I’d been.  Farpoint’s campaign will feel short because it is; that said, holding a plastic gun at attention for hours on end is just as tiring as you’d expect, so it’s not something most people can sit and play all day. However, a handful of bonus modes, including two-player online co-op missions and scored arcade-style challenge levels complete with leaderboards, keep things interesting even after you’ve wrapped up the main missions. The co-op missions are unique and challenging, with multiple difficulty levels and successive waves of enemies that will keep you on your toes even with a partner. There are hectic moments when one player dies, and the other has to scramble to either get the revive or finish the encounter solo, creating some intense fight-or-flight sensations. And you can even entertain yourself in the main menu by walking around a unique space station environment, turning the various gun models around in your hands to peer at their every little detail, and flinging tchotchkes into a distant porthole for points. Farpoint is more than a proof of concept or another tech demo for virtual reality. Despite its predictable and unsatisfying story and hard-to-ignore bugs, it’s a full-fledged sci-fi shooter that feels fantastic to play with Sony’s high-quality PSVR Aim Controller (and slightly awkward without it). Several smart control options and design choices cater to a variety of different types of players, and the gunplay is second to none in VR. If I were to recommend one shooter to a PSVR owner, this would be it.
Caley Roark	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	 Playing Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3, if you’ve played games from similar series like Far Cry and Sniper Elite, gives a constant sense of deja vu. Its mechanics mostly competently echo those more popular franchises, but it doesn’t do any single thing notably better. Most of the time a new game in a thriving genre has a unique idea that distinguishes it and gives it a reason to exist, but not Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3. Yet, despite this lack of innovation, it still executes its open-world stealth combat well enough that it ends up being a fun and tightly constructed game that doesn’t overstay its welcome. Or it would be, if not for numerous graphical and technical problems. As a literal army of one, I used various familiar mechanics to take down my targets at will, including tagging enemies, conducting interrogations and hacking and destroying security systems. From time-bending “scout vision” to deploying remote drones straight out of Ghost Recon: Wildlands, nothing about Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 feels novel or unique.   It’s a martini short of being a decent James Bond game. Then I realized this is a game that’s aiming backward, not forward. In many ways, it feels a little like a throwback to games I enjoyed on the original Xbox – it’s a martini short of being a decent James Bond game, a la 2002’s Nightfire. Strip Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 of it’s open-world environment and what’s left is series of linear missions that are fairly short, objective-based, and generous with checkpoints – things that made action-adventure games satisfying before most of the genre went open-world. Variety keeps these tight missions from getting repetitive. In one, I was covering an agent on the ground. In another, I had to steal a wine truck to infiltrate a mob wedding. No two missions felt exactly the same. Throughout Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3, there’s a good amount of stealth, platforming, and gunplay to keep everything fresh. Of course, a linear menu of missions would be too old-school, so Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 scatters these adventures over various regions full of things to collect, outposts to clear, hostages to rescue, and side missions to complete. A Most Wanted list also keeps you on the lookout for targets of opportunity. I never felt overly compelled to tackle any of these items, out of interest or necessity, though I appreciated that there is more to do once the 26-mission campaign is over after about 12 hours. To its credit, Sniper: Ghost Warrior doesn’t force you to complete any of this side stuff to unlock the next phase of the main campaign. It also populates the map with fast-travel points, so even the very dull driving isn’t a constant necessity.   What kept me coming back, mission after mission was the basic action. On the default difficulty, taking down a sniper from 200 meters or two unaware soldiers with one shot really gave me the feeling of an action movie hero. There is something very cool about lining up a shot, making small adjustments for wind and elevation, slowing time by “holding your breath,” and pulling the trigger. A slow motion “bullet cam” shot is the finale to most sequences of this type; these were repetitive, but never got overly annoying. Even when I had to go loud, the assault weapons felt appropriately powerful; most unarmored enemies can be downed with one or two hits. Likewise, the tension was elevated thanks to my own fragile health. While not as slick or exact as established first-person shooters, the assault-style action was always satisfying. Again, thanks to the varied mission structure, you’re coerced to occasionally leave your sniper’s nest to engage troops directly.  Usually, the enemies provided some good, convincing moments. Usually, the enemies provided some good, convincing moments, except for when the AI has them acting strangely. Once, a missed shot alerted a guard who then proceeded to spin in circles looking for me. Largely, though, the AI is competent and offered a reasonable challenge. Enemies tended to only find me when I made an overly aggressive move or if I accidentally blundered into an impromptu ambush. Those looking for a very difficult challenge might be disappointed, but I found that the AI was generally fair and didn’t cheat by magically finding my hiding spot.  Beyond the combat, the other elements of Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 were adequately playable. Even something as tricky as first-person platforming, which can be a nightmare when done poorly, was fine – with one sizable exception. Three times during my campaign I fell into inescapable parts of the landscape, forcing me to reload. And that’s an especially harsh penalty because load times can be excessively long, especially when you open up a new region. I clocked a load from the main menu at over four and half minutes. It also straight-up froze three times, which is unusual for a console game.  I never felt that being stealthy was ever out of my control. Like the platforming, the stealth elements weren’t normally frustrating. In general, sneaking around in Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 is easy enough with patience. A small map indicates where enemies are looking and an on-screen alert warns when you are in view. By paying attention to both, I never felt that being stealthy was something that was ever out of my control. Even elements like hiding spots and noise distractions went largely unused because they usually weren’t necessary. In fact, a lot stuff in of Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 is underutilized. Most parked vehicles are “locked,” meaning I typically drove the same SUV throughout most of the campaign (though I preferred fast-traveling). A set of skills, appropriately named “Sniper,” “Ghost,” and “Warrior,” unlock based on your gameplay style. For instance, long distance kills give you XP in the Sniper category, while a kill streak nets you points in Warrior. This is a neat idea, but with only nine skills in each area, it feels shallow.   I never needed much more than the starting sniper and assault rifle. In addition to a broad selection of sniper rifles, assault rifles, and pistols, a nice mix of grenades and gadgets round out what you can play with. I liked going low tech with some throwing knives and gas grenades. Despite this decent array of weapons, I never needed much more than the starting sniper and assault rifle with a few mods tacked on. The modification system is pretty basic, allowing the swapping of scopes, magazines, attachments, and camo. Despite these limitations, I was usually excited to see what upgrades I unlocked at the end of each mission. Graphically, Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 can look underwhelming at times, specifically when looking at cartoonish character models and textures. For a game that takes place entirely in a remote and barren part of Georgia (the country, not state), trees and vegetation look particularly bad. I also experienced some minor frame rate drops, usually when jumping into a scoped view. And, while the draw distance is respectable, the detail of the surrounding areas isn’t remarkable. On the other hand, the few weather effects and dynamic lighting looked good enough to help create a believable environment.  Also unremarkable is the campaign’s story, which is full of standard action tropes and fairly predictable. In fact, the entire premise of the plot reminded me of the Bond film Goldeneye, where two agents get separated during a flawed infiltration mission. Of course, there is also long-lost love interest who gets thrown into the mix, reminiscent of Raiders of the Lost Ark. But honestly, I’m doing a disservice to those films by mentioning them here, because all of them execute on those ideas better than Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3’s limp story does. Thankfully, there aren’t many cutscenes, which again keeps the focus on the most enjoyable part – completing the missions. As enjoyable as these missions can be, they’ll be enjoyed alone for the time being. As of release, there is no multiplayer of any kind, despite being a previously advertised feature. While there is a lot to collect and do, the lack of multiplayer definitely hurts Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3’s long-term replayability. Sniper: Ghost Warrior 3 is by no means a great game, though its value is raised by short and varied missions, fun action elements, and an ability to make me feel like a legit action hero. Regardless of how much it borrows from other games, I can’t deny that I had a good time blowing through missions and enemy troops. However, the poor graphics and technical issues like long loading times and crashes occasionally ruined the fun. And, minus any sort of multiplayer, there’s not a lot of reason to go back.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	 What Remains of Edith Finch sits alongside Kentucky Route Zero as one of the finest magical-realism stories in all of video games. A first-person, story-driven experience akin to Gone Home and Firewatch, it tells the incredible, tragic, and constantly surprising multi-generational history of the Finch family. As you explore the the gorgeous labyrinthine home, you’ll go on a guided history of each family member, delve into what may or may not be a familial curse, and ultimately learn how each one succumbed to it. Developer Giant Sparrow (known for The Unfinished Swan) has once again created something truly special. In the two hours it took me to fully explore I ran the emotional gamut from feeling completely devastated to full of an energetic light to annoyed by noticeable performance dips, especially when I approached the house for the first time. The only challenge is finding a way into each locked room of the house, generally through the use of secret passages that make the whole thing exude the charm and imagination of a pop-up book. While exploring the house, the last living member of the Finch family, Edith, narrates with stories of the house, her family, and how the incredible lives they lived untimely came to an end.   While the whole thing is pretty much devoid of any friction preventing you from progressing (there are even fewer puzzles here than in the aforementioned Gone Home), the joy of Edith Finch is in fully immersing yourself in the final moments of each Finch’s life. Once you find a specific momento in each of their rooms, you’re treated to a story of their death, told through fantastical allegories. Each one is presented through a completely different gameplay experience that continually subverted my expectations. With each one, nothing is safe when it comes to art style, perspective, or gameplay genre. I don’t want to spoil them because I got so much joy out of never knowing where the next memory would take me. With the exception of one awkward sequence where you control animals from a first-person perspective, there’s a dreamlike nature to the way these sequences not only bend the rules, but completely obliterate them. While each story is ultimately about death, it’s wonderful how full of life each and every tale is. Even something as heart-wrenching as the death of a child is presented with such exuberant creativity and magic. While experiencing the final moments of their lives is unquestionably tragic, they way they embrace it and welcome whatever might come next filled each story with light. The eccentric family themselves reminded me from The Tenenbaums from Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums, or the Glass family from J.D. Salinger’s various works. Learning how they they were all related and how the various deaths impacted each surviving member is something that I won’t soon forget.   One thing I absolutely love about the house itself is how incredibly lived-in in feels. It doesn’t come across as a set designed around the idea of a video game level, but rather a home that a dozen members of an impossibly creative family lived in over several generations. Part of this comes at the cost of interactivity – there’s very little in the house you can actually touch or manipulate. Like a museum, there’s a “look, but don’t touch” policy here. But honestly, this didn’t bother me given how much I enjoyed the act of meticulously looking at every beautiful detail of the world. Though it only took me just under two hours to complete, the second the credits stopped rolling I immediately restarted What Remains of Edith Finch. Each of the vignettes is so distinct and surprising that I didn’t have enough time to absorb and dissect what I had just played before being whisked away to the next one. But after fully piecing together the threads of the family and sifting through the allegories of their final moments, I was left with a beautiful, heartbreaking mosaic that exudes life, even when mired in death.
Heidi Kemps	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	" When Dragon Quest Heroes hit the scene in 2015, it delivered a solid mashup of two very different genres: classic RPGs and hack-and-slash action. Now, Square Enix and Koei-Tecmo have teamed up again to deliver another monster-mashing, magic-slinging, army-crushing action-adventure in Dragon Quest Heroes 2. While it improves on the original in some ways, it stumbles a bit in the quest to transition Dragon Quest from its RPG roots into an action game. Dragon Quest Heroes 2 begins with the lead characters, a pair of cousins, suddenly thrust into a surprise conflict between two formerly peaceful kingdoms. As they adventure forth, they meet new friends and unravel evil conspiracy to bring all of the world’s kingdoms to war and fulfill an ancient prophecy. The story’s a marked improvement over the weak, ""Oh no, the monsters are evil now"" plot of the first Dragon Quest Heroes, and it develops in interesting ways. The characters it introduces are likable, the storyline – though somewhat predictable – kept me wanting to see what happens next, and the top-notch English localization added a lot of life and humor to both crucial story scenes and incidental dialogue. Characters from other Dragon Quest games will also pop in throughout the course of the story, and as a longtime fan of the series seeing familiar favorite characters appear and join my merry adventuring band was quite a treat, even though the story focus remains squarely on the all-new Dragon Quest Heroes 2 cast.  The story’s not the only thing that’s seen an improvement. The flow of the moment-to-moment gameplay has been changed to more resemble the role-playing adventures that inspired it. Rather than just hopping from mission to mission from a hub or menu, there’s a semi-open world you can explore at your leisure, once you've unlocked each region. You also progress through areas like towns, forests, fields, and swamps much like you would in a traditional RPG, battling your way from destination to destination in a way that feels very natural. It helps that it looks good, too: the environments are distinct and lively, and both the characters and iconic Dragon Quest monster designs are lovingly rendered to look better than ever before.  It’s clear that inspiration was taken from traditional RPGs. There are a lot of different objectives in the critical story missions, as well. These include the usual Warriors-inspired missions where you canvass a large battlefield and mow down hundreds of enemies, but also big boss fights, maze-like dungeons, protection missions, raids on enemy territory, and even a bit of stealth. It’s clear that inspiration was taken from traditional RPGs when coming up with some of the obstacles and objectives in these sections: things like poison marshes, castle mazes, and red-hot damage floors come from decades of RPG tradition.  The problem is that what might work in a slower-paced, menu-driven RPG doesn’t translate well to a hack-and-slash game built on fighting enemy hordes constantly. Things like teleporter puzzles and switch puzzles plopped in between fights bring the sense of action and tension to a screeching halt. One particularly egregious portion has you trotting across the whole of a town multiple times to identify a monster masquerading as a soldier, forcing you to run around and chat up a bunch of boring NPCs over and over until you finally get a few scraps of the fighting you crave. These numerous long stretches of non-action in the middle of action portions tested my patience more than even the tankiest beasts I went up against.  There’s little in combat that’s truly new and noteworthy. If you’ve played a Warriors game before, you’ll know what to expect in terms of the combat in Dragon Quest Heroes 2: big, flashy combos that mow down lots of little enemies at once, special skills unique to each character, and big attacks you can use after you’ve been fighting for a while that will absolutely devastate the battlefield. There’s little here that’s truly new and noteworthy, but there are some nice new improvements to the way your characters develop.  For starters, your two main characters eventually earn the ability to change classes, which gives them access to different weapons and fighting skills and allows you to choose how they fight. Earning skill points and improving weapon proficiency in different classes lets you customize character abilities, and additional skills and buffs can be learned through mastering weapons. You can stick with a class you really like throughout the whole of the 30 to 35-hour campaign, or spend some time doing sidequests to build up skills across a bunch of different classes and switch between them as needed.  The best medals are ones that let you transform into monsters. Monster medals – items that let you summon tamed enemies to aid you in battle – are a big part of the original Dragon Quest Heroes, and they make a vastly improved return in the sequel. As in the original game, some medals allow you to summon a NPC monster that will help you by fighting at your side. Other medals bestow special abilities or status buffs when they’re used. The best medals, however, are ones that let you actually transform into monsters temporarily and use their powers for wanton destruction. These transformations can be immensely useful, providing not just strong special attacks but also movement options like flight and super-speed that can aid you in crossing hazardous terrain and reaching targets quickly.   It’s a lot of fun to crush monsters alongside a friend. Finally, co-op multiplayer (which the first Dragon Quest Heroes notably lacked, especially relative to other Musou-style games) adds the ability to fight alongside up to three other players through either story battles or short dungeons to gather materials. It’s a lot of fun to crush monsters alongside a friend, and having other players in the mix is a huge boon in quests where covering a lot of ground and defending multiple areas is necessary. There are some caveats, however, that make multiplayer messier than it should be. A lobby system that allows you to easily search for players and quests meeting your criteria is only available in the optional Interdimensional Labyrinth dungeons; for story mission multiplayer, you are restricted to joining in only on missions that you have already completed, and have to wait to be matched up with a player who chooses to ask for help. If you want to join a friend’s story missions, you both have to set up a passcode ahead of time and enter it when you want to hop in. Perhaps most annoying is that you'll be kicked out after every completed co-op story mission, requiring your host to re-invite you and for you to manually rejoin every time. Ultimately, though, whether you're by yourself or with friends the fighting still gets a bit wearisome after a while, because it so frequently boils down to beating down hordes of boring weaklings before facing a much bigger threat that actually poses a challenge. Cluttered battlefields also pose a bit of a problem, as it can be a rather difficult to discern at a glance what’s an enemy and what’s a friendly helper – it’s embarrassing to go in swinging at a monster only to realize it’s one you actually summoned. A somewhat clunky camera and targeting system doesn’t help when things get really messy, either, though most of the time you’re so busy slashing up a storm of hundreds of annoying little enemy boogers that it doesn’t matter what you’re looking at. Dragon Quest Heroes 2 feels like a step forward in some ways, but a step back in others. The new additions to combat are nice, but the attempts to bring more RPG elements to the story missions don’t always work out for the best – at worst, they wind up transforming an enjoyable action game into a boring slog. At least it shows that Omega Force is willing to try new things with their long-established formula. Let’s hope that their experiments go a little better next time."
Mike Rougeau	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/full-throttle-remastered-review	 There’s plenty to appreciate in Full Throttle Remastered even if you didn’t play the original back when it was released by LucasArts in 1995. It’s a darkly humorous adventure set in a Wild West-like near future, where the last cowboys (biker gangs) are struggling to stay saddled before the march of encroaching technology (hover cars). A clean new art style and remixed sound make this old hog feel refreshed, although with its questionable puzzle logic and technical issues Full Throttle definitely still feels like a 22-year-old adventure game. Our protagonist, Ben, is the John Wayne of the future: tough as nails but always ready with a quip loaded in the chamber when that’s what the moment requires. With a colorful cast of supporting characters he embarks on a gritty quest for vengeance and salvation, one in which he’ll be knocked off his bike countless times, purposely light himself on fire, and throw concentrated poop in other bikers’ faces.  As a classic point-and-click adventure, Full Throttle mostly involves selecting objects around static environments and telling Ben to interact with them using his eyes, mouth, hands, or feet. It’s a unique system that gives you interesting options without feeling overwhelming.  It’s testament to Tim Schafer’s skillful writing that we get to know Ben well. It’s often funny, as well. “Something tells me the bridge is out,” Ben mutters as you direct him to examine a bridge that, moments earlier, you witnessed explode in a dramatic fireball. It’s testament to Tim Schafer’s skillful writing that in addition to the humor you get to know Ben pretty well over what really amounts to a pretty short game, at around six hours. And that includes time spent developing excellent side characters like Maureen the mechanic and the dastardly Corley Motors executive, Ripburger. It all goes down with a great, clean-looking new art style and totally remastered sound. If you’re a Full Throttle fan already you won’t want to miss Remastered for that reason alone, especially because you can easily see exactly how faithful any given frame is by switching back to the old graphics and sound with the press of a button. There’s a weird satisfaction in doing so, and you might find yourself flicking between the old and new styles frequently just to see how far we’ve come since the days of gigantic pixels. That also makes it evident how vastly the sound has been improved, from the quality of Full Throttle’s original songs (get ready to have one or two of those stuck in your head) to the new mix that thrusts the dialogue by skilled voice actors like Mark Hamill and Roy Conrad into the forefront where it belongs.  It could have used some technical polish, though. Although it no longer looks or sounds as old as it is, Full Throttle Remastered includes stuttering scene transitions and severe frame rate drops during action sequences I didn’t expect to see in a 2D-animated game.  Many puzzles are well designed, but just as many make absolutely no sense. Those issues are irritating but are easy enough to look past if you’ve got the gumption and the grit to see the story through to the end. But if there is one thing that will stand in the way of your riding off into the sunset, it’s the ridiculously unintuitive “adventure game logic” that marked so many old LucasArts adventures. Many of Full Throttle’s puzzles are well designed and thoughtful, but just as many make absolutely no sense, like one where you have to steal multiple boxes of mechanical bunnies that keep magically reappearing every time you screw it up. Those require either a big time investment in trial-and-error or a quick trip to an online guide for a spoilery answer. If you haven’t played Full Throttle before and are determined to see the credits roll on Remastered, don’t be ashamed to look some solutions up, and don’t be surprised when your reaction is less “Ohhh!” and more “Huh?” Ben also gets in high-speed highway duels, clumsy action scenes that have aged poorly despite revamped controls for the Remastered edition. On the other hand, Full Throttle rewards you for paying attention to everything that’s going on. This world is full of tiny details, many of which become important long after they’re introduced. It would be good to remember, for example, that the Cavefish, a rival biker gang, navigate by the reflective bumps in the road because the helmets they wear make them otherwise blind. That’s both a good world detail and one aspect of a puzzle solution later, which is part of Full Throttle’s biggest strength. Full Throttle Remastered mostly succeeds on two fronts: As a fresh way to revisit an old classic, and as the ideal entry point for players who haven’t yet smacked rival bikers with a two-by-four on the Mine Road or figured out the combination to Old Man Corley’s safe. There are a couple of sticking points for both old and new players, including some technical issues and (especially for the latter) that questionable “adventure game logic” which is anything but logical. Nevertheless, there’s never been a better time to hit the open road with Ben and his gang.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	" Trove is a massively multiplayer roleplaying game created with the same brightly colored voxels that define Minecraft, and it's an appropriate choice for what it is. Much like the buildings, landscapes, and even characters formed with these blocks, it lacks clear focus, especially when compared to its genre peers. Somehow it manages to exude a degree of flawed appeal even with these shortcomings, although I've found that its pleasures leave the best impressions in small doses. You can dig through these voxels all you want with a mining laser, but no matter how deep you dig you'd be hard pressed to find a story lurking underneath. Trove kicks off with a cutscene discussing some sort of spat between the sun and the moon, but it drops the concept almost immediately. Roleplay suffers as bit as a result, particularly if you're like me and enjoy having some kind of reason for slaying thousands upon thousands of foes.  No, Trove is more interested in loot than storytelling. Endless, nearly unmanageable loot. It seems to think of itself as an MMORPG with Minecraft trappings, but in structure, it owes far greater debts to Diablo 3's Adventure Mode than World of Warcraft. Seconds after the throwaway cutscene it casts you into a hub that becomes your eternal starting point for every login, and from there it's all about leaping through portals into procedurally generated zones peppered with dungeons and bosses ready to scatter loot. If loot grinds appeal to you, so will Trove, at least in the early hours when the experience is fresh and the environments unfamiliar. Each new piece has the potential to boost your damage or resistances by a significant amount, and Trove keeps the hunt fun by even working in boosts to your ability to jump for longer, which helps with the jumping puzzles around many dungeons. The loot's even fun to look at because most pieces are made by players of the PC version that’s been around since 2015, allowing the aesthetic to shift from rather appropriate Viking helmets to burgers perched ridiculously atop one's head, because why not? Early on, the settings for these loot hunts are almost as visually entertaining as the loot itself. The procedural generation creates a hodgepodge of different styles for each zone, which means you might be trotting on your free starter mount through a candyland with hostile birthday cakes one second and immediately slip into a Tron-like futurescape where purplish light races up through crevasses in metallic structures the next. And, naturally, it all looks like a huge Minecraft project. Such a statement should imply that Trove's simple looks make for a technically smooth experience. But that's not always the case, as strange performance issues pop up, especially at peak hours. Most of the time it plays well enough, but sometimes I'd found myself rubberbanded back into a barrage of fireballs in a dungeon that I was sure I'd avoided. That’s annoying, especially in a game that's so fond of jumping puzzles.  But fortunately, Trove isn't just about fighting. That Minecraft look isn't just for show—you can travel throughout the world collecting blocks of different colors with which to make your own home, as well as special blocks that allow the use of tools such as a loot collector that unlocks new appearances for gear and weapons and grants materials to upgrade other gear. You don't get a lot of room for building your house, but that's because Trove lets you move it anywhere you wish. One of the main attractions of Trove is that it scatters homesite plots all throughout the generated worlds you visit, and you can place your own home on any one of these that's open and use it to refill potions or craft new items. Some player-built plots are boring, but others are wildly inventive. I've seen everything from houses that look like McDonald's restaurants to towering skyscrapers that seem to touch the digital sky. For the most part, Trove handles its transition to consoles well. The tutorial's more robust than it was when I played on PC, for one, and I'm especially fond of the combat scheme for the controller. Based on those elements alone, I'd say Trove comes off as stronger on consoles. Unfortunately, its biggest design flaws pop up immediately anytime you venture away from combat. Consider the text in menus and UI elements – it's so miniscule that I had to move my chair within three feet of my television to play. Trove also maps some important menus to the thumbstick toggles, which resulted in at least two deaths when they popped up when I was in tense moments in dungeons. And chatting with other players gets frustrating. If you want to say anything beyond preset responses and requests, you'll need to hook up a Bluetooth keyboard. At least it gives you significant choices for how to play, if not how to communicate. Trove offers a whopping 14 combat classes, although only the first one is free. (I got two class tokens you can use to unlock any class you wish from just playing, though, so I wouldn't worry too much.) It's a shame they each only come with a handful of abilities, but there's a great deal of variety among them. I spent hours, for instance, with the Neon Ninja, which deals some massive damage but comes with a teensy health pool that makes it a pain to solo with. Later I switched out and played a tanky Relevant, a headless chap who storms into dungeons with spears and shields and only rarely even has to use a potion. Combat itself is simple but filled with unique abilities suited to group play, such as the Neon Ninja's dash that roots enemies in place for a few seconds so other players can beat on them in comparative safety. Trove wants you to switch out classes like this, and generally, it's a good idea. Much like the jobs in Final Fantasy XIV, you'll still have to level each individually, but having the option to switch out to something else in a particularly tough encounter can really boost your effectiveness when playing in groups. Having multiple classes in your stable also allows you to easily participate in the challenges that pop up for completing dungeons in a particular zone and granting bonuses for two random classes, thus unlocking ""Dragon Coins"" for endgame content. Moderately entertaining player-versus-player arenas with a capture-the-flag mode also exist, which makes this a wise design for players who prefer to have different classes for their PvP and PvE activities. But the dungeon experience is largely the same regardless of what you play. Everything above holds up well for the first few hours, and then Trove devolves into a repetitive grind. The setting might shift from winter wonderlands to Old West saloons, but the objective rarely deviates from the pattern of venturing into a dungeon and killing the boss for loot and XP, over and over and over. Sometimes I'd even run from dungeon to dungeon and find myself fighting the exact same boss I'd just fought over in another spot. If Trove has one significant failing as an MMORPG, it's that it has little depth. There's enough boss and dungeon design variety to keep it interesting for those first 15 or so levels, but it only works in short bursts. Playing as I did, hours on end, my mind couldn't help but wander and think of all the other wonderful things I could be doing. It's also decently social, but you might have to work with it. The tutorial eventually prompts you to join a club (essentially Trove's name for guilds), but you shouldn't expect it to be an easy process. For much of my playtime the chat channels were crammed with people stuck on that step of the tutorial asking for an invite to a club, and eventually, I joined the despondent chorus, taking time in between dungeon runs to tap out a plea on my keyboard. I made jokes, I said ""please,"" and I answered questions other players had in chat. But I never got invited. This is strange, as usually in other MMORPGs you'll find people who're willing to invite just any old person to fill their ranks. That's a shame, as I would have loved to have seen Trove's ""Club Worlds,"" which are essentially zones that clubs can turn into a world all their own, or the Shadow Tower, a ""raid"" of sorts that pits eight players against multiple waves of enemies. On the bright side, Trove makes it easy to cooperate with other players even if you're unguilded, as dungeons rewards are shared with anyone who happens to be in the same dungeon. One of the best things about Trove is that it doesn't try to wheedle money out of you at every opportunity. You can play almost the entire game for free, and most of the stuff on the cash shop amounts to little more than cosmetic upgrades. The problem is that, almost as if to make up for that, the stuff that's actually on sale can be wildly expensive. Most of the items on the store (including the ability to unlock a new class) cost credits to buy, and the smallest pack starts at $5, but it's barely enough to buy anything. The next step up is a $20 pack. So if you intend to spend, I hope you're sitting on a little golden trove of your own. Played in long sessions, Trove can quickly grow mind-numbingly dull and repetitive, and its performance issues can sometimes be a pain. But played in short sessions, it's a decently fun way to pass the time, either by building structures, battling bad guys, or experimenting with new classes."
Mike Rougeau	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	 There’s a decent arena shooter hidden deep within the wrinkled, lined pages of Drawn to Death. But it’s not worth flipping through page upon page of wretched jokes, schoolyard insults, and lame attempts at edginess in order to find said decent game. Drawn to Death is simply a mess that can’t provide a single good reason to give it a deeper reading. There’s nothing inherently wrong with the concept of a game that springs to life from the pages of an angsty but creative teenager’s notebook doodlings. Every time you launch Drawn to Death you get a view of this character’s classroom, stodgy teacher droning on in front and cute girl glancing back and smiling, before he looks down at his notebook and the main menu appears.    Drawn to Death just doesn’t feel good to play. The overall aesthetic draws equally from Paper Mario, the 2009 Wii game MadWorld, and ‘90s skateboard decks, and surprisingly it’s Drawn to Death’s strongest feature. Menus, characters, levels, weapons, explosions, and everything else, resemble scribbles done in ballpoint pen – and while that sounds like it should be a disaster, it actually works on the screen. Characters somehow pop against backgrounds on maps that look like folded paper, and combat rarely gets too chaotic to follow (although that can also be partially attributed to the paltry limit of four players per match, which is arguably not a good trade-off). It’s all downhill from there, though. Drawn to Death features a handful of intricate maps and creative modes, a half dozen deceptively complex characters, and a large variety of weapons that are admittedly fun to experiment with. There’s a shotgun, for example, that can sprout ax blades if you pull the trigger with precise timing, and a coffin that catapults corpses, which you reload by literally yanking a new one out of the dirt.    Horribly unbalanced. That sounds great on paper, but Drawn to Death just doesn’t feel good to play. You move sluggishly and float through the air like a sheet of paper drifting on a light breeze, and the time-to-kill – the average length of time it takes to kill an opponent – is absurdly long. Everyone has way too much health, and as a result almost every weapon feels as dinky as a paperclip slingshot. There’s not even splitscreen multiplayer, which a game with a four-player limit definitely should be able to support. Perhaps worst of all is the fact that there’s no way to remap controls; jumping is mapped to “X,” and there’s no way to switch to a bumper-jumper style. In a game that clearly wants you to spend more time floating and double-jumping through the air than on the ground, requiring you to take your thumb off the aiming stick to jump is unforgivable.   Drawn to Death is also horribly unbalanced. There are a few weapons – like the Russian Jackhammer and the Star Laser 3000 – that easily outperform everything else. Likewise with the character roster; each of the six avatars available at launch has a sizeable arsenal of unique moves, abilities, and special attacks, and some are just garbage compared with others. Alan, a seemingly pedophiliac teddy bear with a chainsaw, automatically regenerates health, turns invisible at will, and has powerful special attacks. Meanwhile, Johnny Savage, a guitar-wielding cockney punk, is basically useless because his unique abilities – a ground-slam and guitar attacks – require far too much precision to be reliable. That level of blatant disparity is a bad look for this type of game.  A host of bugs and network problems certainly don’t help. Each character has a set of pros and cons when facing others; one specific character’s melee might do extra damage against another specific character, but one of their abilities might be negated by a different character. These match-ups come off as mostly arbitrary, something you have to memorize instead of being able to understand them intuitively. A comparable but better game, such as Overwatch, achieves the same thing organically and through common sense; The high-flying Pharah is strong against the close-range Symmetra not because of some numbers game but because Pharah is usually out of range of Symmetra’s gun.   A host of bugs and network problems certainly don’t help. In some matches opponents will wind up somehow floating out in the single-ruled lines of nothingness above the map, able to gleefully snipe you with no chance of reprisal. Other times foes simply won’t take any damage from your weapons. Buttons often seem unresponsive, sometimes requiring multiple presses just to switch weapons. And the interface during matches could use some serious work, as it’s currently too hard to tell how much ammo you have left or when your abilities’ cooldowns are up.  Sophomoric and crass. A lot of these issues, from balance to bugs, can be patched, and hopefully will be if Drawn to Death can attract a loyal audience – and one willing to spend money on its microtransactions to earn new character skins and taunts or unlock all the guns immediately (which I never felt the need to do). But its tone is so incredibly hostile – so needlessly mean-spirited – that many players will likely shut it down for good without getting much farther than the tutorial.    Sends the same handful of taunts and insults your way multiple times per match. Drawn to Death isn’t just sophomoric or crass – there’s nothing wrong with some South Park-style shock humor. The real problem is the constant and unending barrage of discouraging abuse it hurls your way at every possible opportunity. Within the space it takes to complete the tutorial you’ll be fully aware of how ugly, stupid, unskilled, and utterly worthless its characters think you are – not to mention what a good French kisser your mom is – and Drawn to Death will never, ever let you forget it. “You died,” the cartoon frog mentor says if you die during the tutorial, “and I’m genuinely sad. I’m not surprised, mind you, because I think you’re stupid. But I am sad.” It’s as if developer The Bartlet Jones Supernatural Detective Agency has taken the kind of in-game chat awfulness that makes so many of us take off our headsets and mute everybody when playing online, and made it part of the game itself. It doesn’t even mix things up, sending the same handful of taunts and insults your way multiple times every single match. You can head into the options menu to turn off the horrendous narrator voice that interjects several times per match with bizarre non-sequiturs that seem to channel creator David Jaffe’s own stream-of-consciousness rants about the video game industry. But there’s no off switch for the scant handful of endlessly repeating lines of dialogue your characters hatefully spew dozens of times per match.   All of this is really a massive shame. Despite all its flaws as a shooter there’s some depth and rewarding complexity in Drawn to Death, if you take the time to read between the lines. Unfortunately, it can’t help taking a dump on the page and shoving your face in it every time you try. With a look this distinctive, Drawn to Death could have hit the ground running. But as a decent shooter it merely limps, thanks to a number of unfortunate design choices, a lack of options, and rampant bugs. Intricate levels, varied weapons and unique characters may have looked good on paper, but any positives Drawn to Death has get scribbled over and obscured by the constant barrage of un-funny abuse it insists on endlessly spewing in your face.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	" Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition is an update of 2011’s Bulletstorm. Here’s what we said when we reviewed the original version back then:   Bulletstorm demonstrates the value of ""why"" for action games. Taken out of the context of its fiction, People Can Fly would have something fun but forgettable on their hands, but the way Bulletstorm fits together results in something cool and memorable. Multiplayer failings notwithstanding, Bulletstorm shines as a single-player shooter. Despite its crass humor and wang-flinging bravado, it's got some real character and heart to it. I'm not happy about the story's sequel-bait belly flop of an ending, but I'm excited to see where Grayson and Bulletstorm go next. - Arthur Gies   Though it may not feel as edgy as it once did, especially next to modern gory popcorn shooters like 2016’s Doom (which also revelled in a heavy metal sensibility) there’s still plenty of gleefully homicidal fun still to be had in Bulletstorm. This remaster adds a significant graphical upgrade that makes some of its original moments sing.  Though its campaign is six years old, Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition looks at home on this console generation in Unreal Engine 4. Textures are detailed, lines are sharp, and a new lighting system has brightened things up significantly. This is particularly noticeable in Bulletstorm’s darker environments, where brightness brings life to previously muddied tones, and in its plentiful gore, where individual intestines can be picked out in among the previously blobby viscera. The upgrade has lent a lot to Bulletstorm’s moments of spectacle. Large vistas and frenetic escape sequences that looked pretty good in 2011 now look much more impressive and feel more urgent; particularly in 4K on PC and PS4 Pro. There’s a feeling that developer People Can Fly has given these moments their due in this remaster.  Elsewhere, Full Clip Edition shows its age. While it runs a lot more smoothly than the original at 60fps, I noticed framerate judders when moving into new environments from a checkpoint, and frustrating invisible walls, sticky environments and the lack of a jump button speak to the most inflexible kind of linearity of that was once a mainstay of the shooter genre. Its adjective-abusing gross-out humour seems less daring than it did in 2011, too; kind of like watching an old episode of South Park and finding it tame and slightly embarrassing compared to the new stuff. Its main distinctive ideas, though, are still a ton of fun. Its central mechanic, the leash that allows you to pull objects towards you, remains the catalyst for all sorts of creative mayhem - turns out kicking a guy into a cactus is still a lot of fun six years later - and its powerful and fun weapons make finishing blows feel crunchy and satisfying. The planet Stygia, a pleasure capital turned ruin, feels cohesive and lived-in, a testament to People Can Fly’s worldbuilding at the time.  Considering its foundations remain as strong as they ever were, it’s a shame that there’s not a huge amount of extras in Full Clip Edition to make returning Bulletstorm fans feel like they’re getting something new. A handful of new challenge maps for its score-based Echo mode and packaged add-ons from the original don’t add much beyond what’s already accessible (including Bulletstorm’s original - and rather disappointing - Anarchy co-op mode). The only thing that’s actually notable is a pre-order bonus that lets you play as a Jon St John-voiced Duke Nukem, a fun and completely off the wall addition considering nothing else in Bulletstorm’s cut-scenes have changed (characters still address the Duke by the name of Bulletstorm’s protagonist, Grayson). It’s a shame, then, that this bonus isn’t available for everyone. Bulletstorm: Full Clip Edition is a great-looking remaster of a still fun, ridiculously over-the-top shooter from last generation that pokes fun at the genre while introducing its own distinctively violent, melee-heavy playstyle. On the other hand, it’s almost completely devoid of new content, which makes it less attractive for returning fans who were hoping for anything more than a facelift."
Andrew Goldfarb	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	 In stark contrast to the slow burn of epic-length cutscenes that greet you in previous Persona games, Persona 5 starts its long journey with a bang by throwing you directly into a fast-paced foot chase through a vibrant, stylized Tokyo casino. That’s a bold move, and it’s emblematic of the entire experience. As we’re introduced to the complex yet approachable turn-based battle system in those opening moments, series fans will recognize not only returning systems from Persona 3 and 4, but also long-absent elements like ranged weapons and negotiation that haven’t been in a Persona game in over a decade, adding more depth and variety to combat. Persona 5 is the culmination of everything the JRPG series has been building to, with familiar elements dialed up to 11 and some welcome new surprises added into the mix. In what’s by far the series’ strongest story to date, Persona 5 puts you in the capable shoes of a high school student who spends his evenings saving the world. By day, you’ll attend class, answer quiz questions, and live the life of a typical teenager, but after school you'll see the clever concept of invading the minds of corrupt adults who are up to no good and battling psychological demons in order to change their hearts.  These stand-out dungeons take place in “palaces” created within the mind of each target, and Atlus takes advantage of this to set them in diverse and outlandish places. Unlike the procedurally generated halls of Persona 3’s Tartarus or Persona 4’s Midnight Channel, Persona 5’s labyrinths are fully hand-built and feature unique puzzles and mechanics that vary with the theme of each dungeon and never repeat. A museum, for example, has very different security measures than a Medieval castle, and you’ll find very different enemies in a pyramid than you might in a spaceship. Assembling pieces of secret codes to solve a bank vault’s cryptogram or positioning tiles to interpret hieroglyphics feel almost like entirely different games. This gives each palace a sense of identity tied to the target and provides some smart, unpredictable story moments and challenges.  Persona 5’s sense of scope is staggering compared to Persona 3 or 4.  Persona 5’s sense of scope is staggering compared to the dungeons in Persona 3 or 4, with palaces easily double or triple the size of those games’ areas. While Persona 4 has you run through linear hallways until you reach the top of a dungeon, Persona 5 has branching paths, networks of hidden rooms, doors that require puzzles to open, and even excursions to other parts of the cognitive world outside of the dungeon itself. Starting each new dungeon is a bit daunting, but solving puzzles and progressing to each new area offers a wonderful sense of accomplishment. While chemistry between the characters never quite reaches the heights of Persona 4’s Scooby Gang vibe, Persona 5’s more cohesive main story does allow each character to shine in individual moments instead, exploring troubled pasts like the loss of a parent to add weight to present day scenarios. This series has never shied away from exploring serious subject matter, and here it shines light on abuse by teachers, drug sales, suicide, and a host of other issues that are handled well and are at times extraordinarily moving. Each character’s motivation for joining you is relatable and unique, and even each palace’s target has believable conviction. An unrepentant drug dealer, for example, reveals an origin that doesn’t necessarily justify his crimes, but fleshes him out into more than just a bad guy caricature.  Battle in Persona 5 is a familiar turn-based formula, with melee attacks, ranged weapons, and magic attacks based on one of eight elements. A bit like catching Pokemon, you collect Personas that you’ll use to fight, and each has its own unique set of skills as well as its own set of strengths and weaknesses. While each of your party members has one permanent Persona to use, the protagonist has the lone ability to hold multiple Personas at once. This means that you can acquire additional Personas to use as you progress, and collecting multiple Personas with different abilities is a fun way to tailor your play style to the type of combat you prefer. You can also fuse combinations of Personas to create new ones, which allows you to inherit certain skills until you’ve created the Persona that’s right for you.  Seeing HD versions of long-time enemies like Jack Frost is a treat for longtime fans.  Enemy designs are varied and colorful, ranging from humanoids that could almost pass as party members to extravagant complicated monsters, and seeing HD versions of enemies like Jack Frost is a treat for those that have been following the franchise for 20 years. Personas themselves also feature a bit of voice acting, which adds a nice extra layer of polish to negotiation during battles. Exploiting enemies’ elemental weaknesses is pretty standard fare (ice is weak to fire, etc.), and swapping between multiple Personas to keep up with the ever-changing vulnerabilities of foes you encounter helps keep combat from becoming too repetitive. The ability to swap between Personas allows you to choose the right element for any given occasion, which becomes important in battles against enemies who are invulnerable to all but one type of attack. As combat becomes more challenging and exploiting enemy weaknesses becomes imperative, smartly using the new Baton Pass ability can allow for devastating chains and exponential damage increases that completely turn the tide in battle. Baton Pass allows you to hand off your turn to another party member after earning an extra battle action by hitting an enemy’s weak point. That gives you the opportunity to chain together multiple passes, adding a new element of strategy to combat. This is a game changer, as you not only have to make sure you have a Persona with the right element to take down an enemy, but also that you’ve selected party members with skills that can keep the chain going. Of course, like any good JRPG, Persona 5 needs a place to allow you to grind to higher levels by fighting enemies over and over. While you can’t return to palaces once they’re complete, you can continually return to a (singular) area called Mementos. Mementos is a large, separate dungeon that returns to the format of procedurally generated hallways like in previous Persona games, and new, deeper levels are unlocked as you beat more palaces. It’s a welcome change of pace in that it provides straightforward battles with no puzzles in between, which is a nice break after working through a particularly challenging dungeon. Since you can’t return to palaces, Mementos also serves as a great place to recruit Personas that you may have missed in previous dungeons. Personas you previously encountered will begin to turn up in new layers of Mementos after you’ve beaten the palace where they originally appeared. Combined with the ability to fuse Personas into new combinations, this thankfully prevents any Personas from being truly missable.  Missions like these were surprisingly moving in some cases, or ended with unexpected humor in others.  Mementos is also home to Persona 5’s side missions, which involve triggering smaller-scale changes of heart in enemies like school bullies or clingy exes in order to receive bonus cash and items. These missions aren’t much more than short vignettes and didn’t really provide deep enough stories to make me care about the minor characters, in most cases. That said, a few stood out as particularly effective, such as a pet lover fighting against animal abuse or workers fed up with the exploitive practices of their boss. Missions like these were surprisingly moving in some cases, or ended with unexpected humor in others. The most elaborate side missions are those that you earn through Confidants, which are party members or other characters who you’ll form relationships with and level up over time. These Confidants will occasionally introduce you to additional tangential characters whose heart you’re required to change in Mementos in order to continue progressing your relationship with that Confidant. These were generally great and helped to reveal a neat twist in the corresponding story, such as a sympathetic person actually being sinister or unexpected connections between characters.   Persona 5 is a solid modern turn-based JRPG first and foremost, but it also quickly becomes a captivating time-management simulator. When you’re not saving the world, your time after school is your own. You’re able to visit hub districts within Tokyo for activities like training at the gym, fishing, working a part-time job, batting practice, seeing a movie, or just heading home to study, play a retro game, or read one of dozens of books. These activities are a gigantic improvement upon the comparatively limited amount of things to do in Persona 4, and a fun way to expand your personal stats like Charm, Guts, or Kindness.  On top of social activities, you also have 20 Confidants to spend time with, forging bonds with fellow students or other citizens of Tokyo. As you level up these bonds you’ll earn relevant stat increases and gameplay advantages that are surprisingly robust. Spending time with a speech-giving politician, for example, might help your negotiation skills, while training with an arcade’s light-gun expert helps your expertise in ranged weapons, and a local board game champion will give you new strategies in battle. Balancing Persona 5’s many activities with maintaining these social links (each of which can only be advanced on specific days) is a welcome challenge and will require methodical notetaking for anyone who wants to maximize each day of the calendar.  Persona 5 gives every decision a fantastic amount of weight.  Confidants themselves are voiced and come in a wide range of ages, genders, and circumstances, with noteworthy stories for each. I found myself almost as interested in some Confidants’ stories as I was in the main plot, which offers even more incentive for dedicating time to hanging out with those people. As in previous games, many of the Confidants can still advance into intimate relationships at their highest levels, though it was disappointing to see that Persona 5 still doesn’t offer same-sex dating, despite plenty of sexual tension between the protagonist and a few of the male Confidants. By offering so many options and only a finite amount of free time, Persona 5 gives every decision a fantastic amount of weight. Choosing to work part-time might give you extra cash to buy better weapons, but it comes at the cost of ranking up a Confidant or increasing your stats. Spending time with a specific Confidant might help you learn a skill that fits your play style, but it means sacrificing learning more about a different character whose story you might be more interested in. Maximizing the skill you’ve been grinding away at or finishing a side story after multiple in-game months of watching it progress are tremendously rewarding experiences, and even lamenting the opportunities you missed adds a unique layer of replayability that makes starting a New Game+ all the more enticing.   Aside from the dozens of activities available, the very act of exploring Persona 5’s Tokyo is a delight. From city lights at night to crowded subways during your school commute, every part of this world is bursting with vibrant color, and every detail feels meticulously thought out and eerily accurate to real-world Tokyo. The anime-like art style is complemented by full animated cutscenes that are absolutely gorgeous and help to punctuate major story events.  Each area of Tokyo feels completely distinct, with the major hubs of Shibuya, Shinjuku, and Akihabara each offering aesthetic differences on top of locations reminiscent of their actual real-life counterparts. Shinjuku features a seedy dive bar in contrast to Shibuya’s family-friendly diner, and Akihabara is home to an arcade and shops for buying games and electronics. As the subway-themed map begins to fill in, you get a sense of just how much there is to do in Tokyo compared to Persona 3 and 4’s relatively tiny Tatsumi Port Island and Inaba.  The very act of exploring Persona 5’s Tokyo is a delight.  All of this is further enhanced by Persona 5’s impressive sense of style. I found myself flicking back and forth in menus over and over simply to appreciate the slick transitions. Sharp design choices permeate even tiny details of gameplay, like scene changes that vary based upon your mode of transportation as you leave each area, or a free-flowing results screen after victory in battle. It almost feels strange to highlight since the incredible style is immediately apparent after looking at it for even a few seconds, but I can’t overstate the number of times that I marveled at the gorgeous effects like ambushing an enemy and flowing directly into battle, or went out of my way to explore on a rainy day to appreciate weather effects or small touches like pulling out an umbrella as you leave a building. Persona 5’s dynamic acid jazz-inspired soundtrack also helps to highlight everything from quiet moments to bombastic boss battles, helping to tie together an overall experience that feels truly special. Persona 5 is a massive, gorgeous JRPG with well over 100 hours of gameplay for completionists. With more to do than ever and the series’ strongest story to date, it stands out as an extraordinary, memorable experience and easily one of the deepest JRPGs of the last decade. Its sprawling dungeon design and stylish, fully realized world are an absolute joy to explore, and even after three playthroughs and the Platinum trophy, I find myself itching to go back to try different dialogue options with Confidants or revisit particularly fun puzzles. This is a new gold standard for Japanese RPGs and by far the best entry in the series yet.
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/dark-souls-3-the-ringed-city-review	 You’d expect the finale of the Dark Souls trilogy to be a grand, apocalyptic affair, and as far as its haunting new settings and frightening boss fights go, The Ringed City certainly delivers. But for all the cool new gear, spells, and thrilling tests of skill and endurance it throws at you, this final DLC adventure for Dark Souls 3 has its strongest moments tucked away in the quieter corners of its carefully crafted world. This is the end of Dark Souls as we know it, and with it comes a host of exciting lore implications that tie back to previous games in the series. Most of those moments trigger startling revelations about this beloved world's past, but also a few thought-provoking questions about its future… even at the end of everything. Watch the first 13 minutes of Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City below.  Your journey to the legendary Ringed City actually begins in the Dreg Heap, a dreary, ash-covered ruin that resembles a tangled mass of old kingdoms, folding into themselves. The verticality of this strange place brings a terrifying scale to the opening moments of your journey. One of the first things you do upon your arrival is drop down a series of ledges, before later falling several stories straight into the stained glass window of a fallen church. The dizzying heights and mangled architecture of the Dreg Heap is disorienting, bordering on the surreal, and I often found myself stopping just to take in the awe-inspiring views between bouts of battle with its equally corrupted residents. But your downward progression towards the Ringed City feels compellingly thematic, too — a literal descent towards the end of the world, as everything that ever was and ever will be crumbles into oblivion. Check out The Ringed City's terrifying first boss below. (Spoilers.)  Remnants of Lordran and Drangleic are around every corner, sometimes buried deep inside item descriptions or environmental details only the most observant may notice. Other times, the connections are startlingly direct. My careful exploration often gave way to unexpected revelation as I realized the true nature of where I was, or where I was going. But even if you aren’t invested in Dark Souls lore, there is still a satisfying handful of secrets, shortcuts, and side paths to break up the relatively linear progression of the main journey. I found at least two illusory walls, and several well-hidden detours, where formidable NPC invaders or a new weapon or spell lay in wait.  New +3 rings not available in NG+3 iterations are handy finds. Even after the initial 7 hours it took to beat the first time (albeit at a slow pace), I spent several hours after trying to complete an NPC sidequest and grappling with a particularly tough riddle. I’ve also found myself coming back to track down the plentiful new gear offered up, which includes a set of massive dual greatswords, a dagger that extends into a crystal bladed sword, and a staff infused with the corpse of a “mad king.” Certain armor sets recall characters and enemies in previous Souls games, and new +3 rings for those not available in NG+3 iterations — such as Havel’s Ring and the Wolf Ring — are handy finds. The Giant Door Shield might take the cake as the silliest offering in the otherwise dreary DLC: dual greatshields that lock together to create a massive double door, which you can plant in place to absorb hard hits or charge into crowds of enemies like a battering ram. (I look forward to the inevitable Giant Door Shield-only runs.) Check out the ridiculous Great Door Shield in action below.  The enemies that roam The Ringed City aren’t incredibly new or imaginative, but they are at least relevant to the tale being told. Hollow-eyed insect men scurry around a marsh of sunken churches, lashing at you with glowing birch branches as they preach of doomsday. Intimidating Ringed Knights who patrol the streets with dragon-headed greatshields were particularly fun to face off with. (And yes, you can get their armor set.) Perhaps the most interesting new foes are the haunting angel-like creatures in the Dreg Heap, which demand a more restrained, problem-solving approach to overcome. They also have some of the coolest lore implications if you know where to look — yet another way The Ringed City forces you to take your time, despite how compact it is.  Environmental obstacles spice up exploration in cool ways, including a stealth section. Occasionally, it throws way too many enemies at you at once rather than setting up more interesting encounters. Fighting my first Harald knight was fun, but facing six at once while being bombarded by projectiles from smaller enemies was more annoying than engaging. But The Ringed City demands patience, even moreso than usual. That’s especially true in a certain familiar swamp area, which introduces an element of stealth not typical to the Souls series. Bringing the acute attentiveness and patience learned from this early section into the rest of the DLC makes even its toughest hurdles manageable. One of my favorite of its environmental obstacles, aside from being visually stunning, initially makes the Anor Londo archers look like child’s play. Check out the second boss of The Ringed City below. (Spoilers.)  The four bosses you’ll encounter (three required and one optional) each bring some interesting element to the battle — whether that means an alterable second phase, a startlingly vast arena, or even an interesting multiplayer element. While playing pre-release means I wasn’t able to test it myself, one of the boss fights ties into a new covenant introduced in The Ringed City, which will enable the boss to summon loyal members into other players’ battles. That means you’d be fighting player invaders alongside the boss (think the Looking Glass Knight fight in Dark Souls 2), which could feasibly grant longevity to The Ringed City for fans of PvP. Dark Souls 3: The Ringed City has found a way to revisit the past without a cheap reliance on nostalgia, wrapping up the story of Dark Souls in a way that will be satisfying for fans who enjoy digging into the rich lore the series has been building for the last few years. But you don’t need an encyclopedic knowledge of the Souls series to appreciate the satisfying twists and turns of this short, but exciting adventure, with its abundance of haunting, secret-filled locales and terrifying boss fights.
Caley Roark	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/mlb-the-show-17-review	 “The one constant through all the years...has been baseball.” Or, to frame James Earl Jones’s Field of Dreams quote in another way, baseball is a game that stubbornly sticks to tradition. New rules like pitch clocks aren’t rushed into practice without years of deliberation. With the sport itself remaining relatively static, it’s hard to fault MLB The Show 17 for maintaining its deliberate march toward perfection. Yet, last year, the game took its biggest step this generation, with major additions to the career mode and a total revamp of its card-based Diamond Dynasty. For a series that seems to constantly tweak and not rebuild features, these changes were a big deal. Certainly, I thought, a second year of huge upgrades would be asking too much.  However, I was surprised to find that MLB The Show 17 does, in fact, take major strides to make the game more authentic and, in turn, more fun.   The expectations are set high early, with a surprisingly good opening video; it’s definitely worth watching at least once. From there, the menus have been given a fresh look. They continue to be easy to navigate and put the stuff used most often right up front. In-game, lighting has been improved, which is especially notable after the attention it has received over the past few years. Day games are especially vibrant. I continue to be impressed by the MLB The Show 17’s ability to communicate the time of day and year based solely on changes in the sky and lighting.  The game is full of new animations, which do more than look nice. They have a definite impact on how you and the AI play the game. For instance, infielders read the runners in order to put an appropriate amount of velocity on their throws. No longer will you see a runner beat out a throw because the fielder casually took too long. In the outfield, defenders don’t take robotically precise routes to the ball anymore. I’ve seen outfielders get a poor jump on a fly ball, then compensate and make a great catch. I’ve also witnessed a fielder close in too quickly to the ball, only to watch it skip to the wall for extra bases. These animations are very subtle sometimes, but noticeable if you’ve been a regular fan of the series. Add to these new animations a large increase in hit variety, and you’ve got a very authentic looking and playing baseball game. Sony touted a big jump in the number of different types of hits you can get, and they didn’t exaggerate. Floating line drives, spinning grounders, and wind-blown fly balls look and act very realistically. My favorite type of hits to watch are bloop singles that fall just out of reach of any fielder. I don’t recall seeing this type of hit in past versions of The Show.    New MLB Network broadcast elements also increase the game’s authenticity. One particularly neat aspect is Showtrack, a stat-driven overlay that appears on some replays. For example, I hit a long home run and was treated with an illustration of the path of the ball, exit velocity, hang time, and distance. It looks exactly like something you’d see on TV. If there’s one complaint regarding the presentation of MLB The Show 17, it’s that the transitions reveal some framerate issues. To be fair, these are the only performance hiccups I’ve seen so far, playing on a regular PS4 and standard HDTV. The MLB Network stuff also brings new commentary, thanks to on-air personalities Harold Reynolds and Dan Plesac. Initially, I felt that there wasn’t a lot of connection between long-time announcer Matt Vasgersian and the new guys. Their lines seemed to exist in a vacuum. But the more I’ve played, the more I noticed conversational exchanges between the three. Vasgersian still dominates as the play-by-play guy, but both Plesac and Reynolds offer timely and accurate information. There seems to be a new focus on explaining batters’ past performance against each pitcher, which is neat.  Unfortunately, repetitive lines of dialogue continue to creep in. In fact, during one game Harold Reynolds described both starting pitchers by using the same exact lines. With a limited amount recorded content, repetition is something that will likely be more noticeable the more I play. Still, this is probably the best team of broadcasters The Show has had, thanks to their fresh and interesting dialogue. The three-man crew ably brings the feel of real TV baseball onto the PS4.   The three main modes of play return: Road to the Show, Franchise, and Diamond Dynasty. Added to the mix is the new Retro Mode, an attempt to replicate old 16-bit baseball games like Ken Griffey Jr. Presents Major League Baseball. While I loved those old games, this mode falls flat for me. For one thing, splash screens, text, sound effects, and music are delivered with old-school charm, while the players and animations are still current gen. And as good as the current gameplay is, it doesn’t quite fit in with the loose arcade setting of the past. I get that the mode is likely designed for local multiplayer sessions with your buddies, but I can’t see any other reason to revisit it. Road to the Show contains one of my favorite new additions so far: the entire career mode is now framed as a baseball documentary. An off-screen narrator describes the important locker room decisions players will have to make.  For instance, my AA catcher, who honestly wasn’t that good at catching, was asked to move to the outfield. I agreed; the team was stacked with catchers and lacking power hitting outfielders. I could have complained about or refused the move, and my story would have played out differently--with me likely riding the pine or being shipped to another city. It’s fun shaping the player’s personality as well as his skills. All of this is presented as though I was the focus of an “30 for 30” style show. In all, I found the entire documentary idea novel and interesting. Franchise mode is relatively similar to last year, but the “Critical Situations” feature is the new star. While simming, if something big is about to happen, the game will pause and allow you to take control. Thus far, I’ve been given chances to walk off a game in extra innings, close out a tight contest, finish a complete game, and try to complete a batter’s cycle. This feature should allow users to get through more seasons without missing the big moments. As for Diamond Dynasty, the core components of this card-based mode remain intact. The goals and reward system have been tweaked, with more ways to earn XP and currency throughout the game. Franchise mode itself is given a whole “ladder” of ways to earn points and cards for use in Diamond Dynasty. In fact, for a new user the number of options might be a bit overwhelming.  I’m intrigued by the promise of timed events with specific entry requirements. Hopefully, these events will give life to the variety of cards that typically never make it into my starting lineup. On the other hand, I’m disappointed that the Conquest game within Diamond Dynasty is unchanged. This odd mix of Risk and baseball was fun last year, but felt like it needed one or two more twists to keep it interesting; I don’t see myself reinvesting a lot of time recapturing the USA, especially since my team has been effectively reset. Finally, while my online experiences have been limited thus far, they haven’t been flawless. I had some noticeable lag between swing and contact, and in one instance my fielder kept glitching out while waiting for a fly ball. Neither issue affected the game as a whole, and the rest of my online matches have been fine. Overall, MLB The Show 17 builds on last year’s version, which many cited as the best in the series, by adding some key features and improvements. Most notable are increased hit variety, MLB Network integration, and the RTTS documentary. All of these additions make the game feel more like real baseball. This authenticity makes games more fun to play, as it’s easier than ever to become invested in every pitch.
Joe Skrebels	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/rain-world-review	 Rain World is astonishingly good-looking and absurdly cruel, a 2D action-platformer that thrills almost as often as it makes you throw down the controller in despair. Almost. Guiding a character only referred to by the developers as a “Slugcat”, your travels across an obtuse, ruined world combine elements of stealth, survival, and even hints of shoot-‘em-up to great effect - but the structure of the game itself works against its sometimes brilliant moment-to-moment play. During development, the game became a consistent source of Twitter gif fodder for its almost uncannily fluid character animations, achieved through a mixture of pixel art and procedural generation. In playing, Rain World has lost none of that charm. It’s the first thing you notice, in fact – Slugcat clings onto poles, shimmies through cramped ventilation and pounces across gaps not only beautifully, but reactively, taking into account the angle you began at and adjusting accordingly. Enemies follow suit, with everything from carnivorous, camouflaged plantlife to enormous, gas-spurting vultures acting and reacting with spectacular, horrible grace.   The backdrop of a world ruined by ecological catastrophe wrestles for your attention, too. Flooded subterranean chambers shimmer with reflected ripples, overgrown architecture is dappled with shifting shadows of clouds and enemies hovering out of sight. Each single-screen area looks meticulously crafted, dotted with almost unnecessary levels of detail to make them feel not just like video game levels, but a truly abandoned place. It is, without doubt, one of the best-looking 2D games I’ve ever played. Rain World’s basic gameplay rhythm is one of survival and reconnaissance – using Slugcat’s jumping prowess and whatever weaponised debris you can find, discover a safe room (as thinly spread and desperately welcome as Dark Souls’ bonfires), scout out enough food to hibernate safely, return to the safe room to reset the day cycle and save your map, then begin it all again. There’s no stated goal beyond this – a practically wordless storyline suggests that you’re guiding your Slugcat back to its family home, but what direction you head in across its sprawling map is up to you.  It’s refreshingly hands-off. The game’s enemies – many of whom can kill in a single hit – have patterns of behaviour (even sub-species have different abilities – pink Komodo-like lizards can climb when green ones cannot, for example) to be learned and exploited. Certain plants grant different effects when eaten, while others seemingly only offer a gross little bonus animation that lets you vomit them back up at any time. Story’s told almost entirely through environmental detail, single images during hibernation or flashing holograms projected by a strange worm companion that seems to be observing you throughout. It’s the kind of game that lends itself to excited conversation and wiki deep-dives, and the urge to explore is strong. At first. Progression into new regions and ecosystems is dependent on you hibernating several times without dying. However, with food sources somewhat randomised (areas packed with prey nests might be simply empty on one cycle of play), the process of just collecting it can become a chore. Couple that with random enemy placement – meaning learning how to progress through trial and error is out of the question – and it becomes a grind. Add to that the fact that a new save point might be several rooms into a brand new area, and that dying there will not only take you back to before you unlocked it but force you to eat and hibernate again before even entering the new area again. Well, then it becomes something else entirely – boring.   Oh, and I haven’t mentioned that if you spend too long without hibernating, it will begin raining so hard that simply stepping in a downpour crushes you to death, and the entire world will eventually flood. Any one of these systems by itself would be tough but fair, but in combination the odds are stacked so high against the player that it risks toppling the entire structure of the game. I have no doubt that a few will enjoy the cruelty of Rain World’s systems (I can feel the “git gud”s coming even now) but, in a game that makes exploration its true reward, to be forced to trudge through the same areas a dozen times or more is antithetical at best. There’s definitely bravery in turning pure player skill into the means of progression, but the cost is simply too high when it goes wrong – not least when player skill is sometimes not the problem.  Enemies are presented as persistent beings, stalking across multiple areas by using the same entrances and shortcuts as you – except when they teleport across the room through no discernable means. Worse, even the game’s best elements can take their toll. Those procedural animations can become imprecise in action – while being chased by an enemy, I have more than once accidentally climbed into a useless hole – turning myself into a potted treat for a beast – instead of climbing through the escape tube placed directly next to it, simply because of the angle I approached at. Rain World is a maddening thing, because of quite how special it could have been. Beautiful environments, incredible animations and enticingly hazy mechanics are fantastic, but the sheer cruelty of how it’s pieced out to the player transcends challenge and becomes an unwanted trial.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	 Not only is Psychonauts in the Rhombus of Ruin a great story that bridges the gap between the 2005 original and the upcoming sequel, but it’s an entertaining, intuitive VR adventure game to boot. Written by renowned adventure game designer Tim Schafer, Rhombus of Ruin is every bit as funny, charming, and personable as the first Psychonauts. Reuniting with Raz, Lili, Milla, and Sasha was fantastic, especially given the new dynamic of seeing the kids as recent graduates of Whispering Rock Psychic Summer Camp, and now equals with their teachers. I really loved watching Raz and Lili’s cute, awkward relationship grow, as well as gaining a bit of insight on what the new threat in Psychonauts 2 will be.   That said, the immediacy of the story and complete lack of introduction to who the characters are will make the events carry little weight for newcomers of the series, as well as folks who might not’ve played Psychonauts in over a decade. Rhombus of Ruin implements the same first-person, node-based movement of VR games like Batman: Arkham VR. In essence, you can look around in all directions, point to various predetermined spots in the environment, and warp to them to survey the environment from a different angle. This works really well within the fiction of Psychonauts, because over the course of the three-hour adventure Raz uses his Clairvoyance ability to mentally project himself inside the bodies of other characters/animals in the world. This gave me a slew of unique perspectives from which to view and solve puzzles without leaving me disoriented or nauseous, even in the slightest. Rhombus of Ruin pulls a Castlevania: Symphony of the Night, in that it shows you all of your cool powers from the start before stripping them all away for plot reasons and making you recover them one by one. It provides a nice dangling-carrot element that propelled me forward since I always wanted the next fun ability. There’s a playful nature to using these abilities from a first-person VR perspective  that I really appreciated. Whether it was using Pyrokinesis to set some books on fire and see how the characters reacted to my chaos or using Telekinesis to toss objects across the room, I found myself lingering in scenes just to see what sorts of optional trouble I could get in. I really appreciated the fact that Rhombus of Ruin responded to my weird decisions.   While the simplistic controls make for a smooth VR experience, it also means that the “puzzles” that impede you in the world just barely fit the definition of the word. Interacting with the environment is accomplished by just looking at an object to target it and then hitting the corresponding button on the DualShock to initiate said power. And, unlike some of Tim Schafer’s classic adventure games like Grim Fandango and Day of the Tentacle, at no point was I stumped by any of the mental hurdles placed in front of me. My one big disappointment with Rhombus of Ruin is that it’s so centrally located around one area — a Bermuda Triangle-esque underwater wreckage of vessels — and doesn’t display the diversity that made me adore the original game. Most of your time is spent underwater or in submerged vehicles, save for one awesome trip into the mind of a familiar character. Compared to the first game, which had us popping from Vaudeville theaters and Napoleonic board games to psychedelic discos and abstract recreations of the JFK assassination, Rhombus ironically feels one dimensional. I really wish it would’ve let me pop into the headspace of more of characters that I’ve loved and missed for the past decade. Despite the fact that this is a first-person VR adventure mostly devoid of the combat platforming that made the original Psychonauts so memorable, it still carries the same spirit. The wonderful writing and solid use of VR make it a fitting continuation to the series that left me pining for Psychonauts 2, especially when it ended after three hours and visiting just a handful of locations.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	 After trading fisticuffs with a Transformer, cartwheeling around a bullet-spewing tank controlled by evil clowns, and using a moose to buck my way through killer robots, it’s safe to say that there are very few games – if any – quite like Nier: Automata. At different times it’s a hack-and-slash, an RPG, a shoot-‘em-up, a brawler, and even a text adventure. But no matter which style it is at any given moment, this dazzling hybrid delivers 30-plus hours of fantastically fun action, remarkable locations, and a story so weird I doubt I’ll forget it anytime soon.   Nier: Automata takes place in a desolate but stunning futuristic dystopia where humanity has fled to the moon after an extraterrestrial invasion, leaving behind an army of androids to fight the aliens’ more primitive but prolific machines. It’s a world where lush green tendrils of ivy coil around the massive skeletal remains of crumbling skyscrapers and tears of rust streak down the sides of old factories, with rotund buildings and looming cranes dominating the skyline. Automata’s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing.  Automata’s striking art style and enormous sense of scale are mesmerizing to look at on the PlayStation 4, but especially on the PlayStation 4 Pro. It doesn’t go above 1080p on the Pro, but colors appear fresh and vivid, while better lighting and shading bring the world into sharper focus. I did encounter a few hiccups that knocked the frame rate below 60fps and witnessed a fair share of texture pop-in, but they only pockmarked Automata’s lovely features ever so slightly. That, or I was too enchanted with the soaring, chorus-filled soundtrack to really notice; Automata will definitely be joining its predecessor’s score on my playlist. The story that takes place amongst the tumbled remains of abandoned superstructures is bizarre and entertaining, if somewhat haphazard. First as an android named 2B and later as other characters experiencing the same events from different perspectives, your job is to fight the alien machines and bring an end to the war. The quirky, full-tilt drama that unfolds as you bounce between Earth and the moon is an intriguing one, touching on existential themes like the meaning of life and humanizing those on the other side of war. It works, for the most part, due to a couple of bonkers plot twist and well-done voice acting that helps sell the more outlandish bits of allegory.   Like its predecessors Nier and Drakengard, Automata does have an unfortunate tendency to wander into uber-convoluted territory, and this is where problems start to arise. Try as I might, I couldn’t always understand what was happening,  even after I played through several of Automata’s multiple endings. There are also some emotional moments that struck me as forced. It's as if the game's lead writer Yoko Taro wanted to make me cry and was casting about for ways to make that happen. (To be fair, one event did have me pretty darn misty-eyed.)  I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier. The bigger issue was the disconnect I felt from 2B and her fellow androids. Their personal dramas take too long to unwind, which prevented me from fully investing in their fates. Why should I weep or cheer for them if I’m not given a reason until 20 hours in? With that said, I was happy to see familiar faces from the original Nier pop up to help clarify the connection between it and Automata. Their presence brought about a welcome sense of nostalgia and helped bring closure to Nier: Gestalt's open-ended finale. I didn’t feel much of a rapport with the heroes, but I definitely enjoyed playing as them. There’s an incredible sense of freedom that comes with effortlessly surfing sand dunes in the desert and shimmying up the concrete remains of office buildings in Automata’s open world. Parkouring plays a big role here, and it’s highly enjoyable thanks to ultra-fluid controls and a very smart camera that effortlessly tracks the action no matter how insane things get. And things get pretty nuts: Automata’s different flavors of combat are a maniacal, supersonic affair, and a total blast to play.   Automata is described as an action RPG, but it’s really an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink kind of game. In between hearty chunks of feel-good hack-and-slash, you’ll trade a fireworks display worth of projectiles with flying enemies, hack into robot mainframes, read a text adventure or two, and even brawl with a pair of psychotic twins. This radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride, and I mean that literally: in one of the craziest, most beautiful action sequences I’ve ever encountered, you’ll fight atop a moving roller coaster while racing full speed through the dilapidated remains of a sun-kissed boardwalk. The radically changing gameplay makes for a thrilling roller coaster ride.  The majority of enemy encounters take place on the ground, in sun-dappled pine forests and submerged cityscapes. These seamlessly connected areas offer plenty of space to experiment with Automata’s excellent free-flowing combat, which is where the gameplay shines best and brightest. The system is streamlined into a variety of light and heavy attacks that make it easy to leap, shoot, hack, and slash through giant metal serpents and giant arm-flailing bipeds whose hard knocks can only be avoided through quick thinking and nimble dexterity.

Casey DeFreitas	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	 If there was ever an anime or manga that was ripe for a Dynasty Warriors game treatment, it’s Berserk. The legendary 100-Man-Slayer’s gruesome story translates well to an action game about hack-and-slash murder sprees, and wielding his giant hunk of iron in Berserk and the Band of the Hawk felt powerful and satisfying… until it got a little too simple and repetitive. After I got over Band of the Hawk’s inexplicable lack of co-op (nearly every other Warriors-style game includes it), I jumped into the lonely single-player action gameplay. Like the rest of Dynasty Warriors’ many spinoffs, it’s easy to grasp and superficially satisfying, especially when performing specials in the form of Death Blows to eradicate entire swarms of enemies in explosive displays of blood and guts.  Taking control of the Guts, the epitome of badassery, was a treat for me as a Berserk fan, and that basic loop of racing to fill the Frenzy meter and unleashing unstoppable fury upon foes took longer to get old than it had any right to. Enemies come in many shapes and sizes, from soldiers, to spirits, to bipedal crocodiles, and even weird possessed horses; and they’re all incredibly entertaining to watch fly about the screen. Some of them even get cut clean in half with a Death Blow, leaving torsos and heads briefly on the field.  The too-simple, two-button combo system left me wanting more. But the too-simple, two-button combo system left me wanting more, especially when I discovered that the same simple strategy works just as well against most bosses as it does against hordes. You just kill a bunch of little things until you’re powered up, then you kill the big thing. It’s aggravating because there are seven other playable characters that could have cut down the story mode’s repetitiveness drastically, but out of 46 Story Mode missions lasting a total of around 20 hours, only five let you choose a character besides Guts.   I would have loved to experiment more with other characters. I would have loved to experiment more with Griffith’s impossibly quick sabre, Shierke’s hard-hitting AOE magic, or Casca’s martial-arts inspired swordplay, and these other characters also have access to entirely different sub-weapons, further enhancing their diverse fighting styles. But alas, Guts is who you’ll have to smash through Story Mode with in order to even unlock these characters for use in other modes. His extra combo finishers and new sub-weapons are unlocked as you progress, and both offer a few brief moments of newness. Guts’ cannon is stand-out here, doing a considerable amount of damage and noticeable side-effects to enemies, stunning them or outright obliterating them in an AoE explosion. You can also ride horses into battle, but mounted combat isn’t nearly as effective as attacking on foot and it gets old fast. It’s a funny sight and they are an excellent method of transportation, but when it comes down to it, it’s still easy to follow the same tactics against mobs over and over and over again.  That repetition is partly because the mechanics that’re here aren’t really used. You are capable of guarding and dodging, but I rarely needed to do either unless I was up against a formidable boss. But most of those are surrounded by minions, which made it much too easy to quickly fill the Frenzy and Death Blow gauges for massive damage.  These balanced boss fights were far and few between. Nosferatu Zodd stood out as a challenge because he fights alone. Unable to rely on easily mowed down mobs to charge insta-win Death Blows, I needed to learn his attack patterns so I could strike when I had an opening and dodge away when he was about to unleash a guard-breaking blow. Smart use of attack-boosting items was also needed to completely deplete him of his HP before the time limit. It was challenging, in a fun way, but these balanced encounters were far and few between. So I cranked up the difficulty, but even then Band of the Hawk barely put up a fight. And for some reason, even though it wasn’t significantly harder, it rewarded me with absolutely absurd amounts of experience as though I’d done something to earn it, basically power-leveling me and putting me even further above the competition.  So most of Band of the Hawk is a pushover, but there is one boss fight that spikes frustratingly hard in the other direction, even on normal mode. The boss is surrounded by tornadoes and throws gravity magic balls and blades at you if you’re able to bypass the whirlwinds of death. This is all to be done while your movement speed is cut in half, which can only be remedied – temporarily – by destroying a marker that sometimes also takes refuge within the barrage of tornadoes. It was so mind-numbingly absurd that I could only beat it by cheesing. Actually, I really can’t tell if I even was cheesing, or if my method was what Berserk and the Band of the Hawk intended. Yes, I’m still salty. But the point is this boss fight wasn’t good.  I spent a lot of time tinkering with the unexpectedly interesting accessory-customization system. In between story missions, I spent a lot of time tinkering with the unexpectedly interesting accessory-customization system, which I thoroughly enjoyed. These customized accessories, like a Strong Cuff or a Midland Insignia, can be equipped with skills from a list of dozens ranging from Daunt Resistance (which makes it harder to get staggered by enemies), to Technique Up (which increases your movement speed and critical hit chance). It felt great to modify an item, level it up, and feel an immediate difference on the battlefield. With Daunt Resistance, Guts went from being thrown around like a ragdoll by Zodd if I failed to dodge an attack to standing his ground against all but the most devastating of blows. Accessories even made finishing story mode missions more fun, as the better I did, the more loot I got to experiment with.   There are no extra awesome new weapons or gear to be found in Story Mode. These accessories can even be used in Free Mode and Endless Eclipse Mode, both of which allow you to freely choose any unlocked character and replay any mission you’ve already done. But that wasn’t enough to make me go back and replay very much - after all, it’s still not very challenging. Story mode missions are missing good incentives to do anything other than race to the finish line, so repeating them is very one-note. The collectibles, called Behelits, are found by completing mini-objectives within story mode missions, but all they unlock are panels of pictures in the Gallery. There are no extra awesome new weapons or gear to be found in Story Mode, almost completely removing any desire to go back and explore within them. Endless Eclipse Mode, on the other hand, is where you’ll unlock more things of interest. There are Warhorses (such as Griffith’s White Hawk’s Warhorse) and outfits, some of which are pretty awesome aren’t found until deep into Endless Eclipse, and a special character, Wyald, one of the Apostles that shows up as a boss in the Story Mode, complete with a Transformation ability. The downside is that like most of the rest of Band of the Hawk it’s quite repetitive, but at least it’s difficult for a change because the enemies gain health and hit harder the deeper into the never-ending abyss you go, and you don’t regain health. Finally, a challenge! And, because rewards in Endless Eclipse Mode are unlocked on different levels, up to 100, and each playable character unlocks different things, there are a lot of hours of replayability in this mode.  As for the story, Berserk and the Band of the Hawk pulls directly from its acclaimed source material, and it’s actually not a bad way to start if you’ve never read or watched anything Berserk-related before. It’s primarily action oriented, but what makes the franchise shine is its sometimes hard-to-watch dark-fantasy story. Berserk and the Band of the Hawk starts with the Golden Age Arc, the beginning of Guts’ and Griffith’s story, and includes nearly two hours of anime footage. It even expands on that arc extensively with more scenes, events, and mid-mission conversation—which is, unfortunately, all in Japanese with no English option other than subtitles. Reading a multitude of subtitles is difficult if not impossible when focused on slaying enemies; I wish I could re-read this dialogue somehow. Even so, I learned more about Guts’ world by playing this game than I did by re-watching the movies, for sure. The second half of the story, which goes into The Black Swordsman Arc and beyond, drops the anime footage and speeds through plots covered by the anime and manga. In hindsight, I wish I’d finished the manga before playing because I feel main plot points are somewhat spoiled for me now, but it did pique my curiosity enough that I still want to read the full details on Guts’ story. Berserk and the Band of the Hawk is mindlessly repetitive, but its combat is still somehow addictive enough to be an enjoyable action game with a dark-fantasy story that stays true to its source, most suitable for fans of Berserk. It even left me craving to try out new characters in Endless Abyss Mode. But it desperately needs more challenge and variety to carry it through its campaign, especially considering you can’t bring a friend with you.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	 There’s something about being dropped into a brand new game world and finding it to be dense with deeply considered lore, terrifyingly aggressive creatures, and tantalizing questions that leaves an indelible mark on the memory. Horizon Zero Dawn is one of those games, and it carves out a unique identity within the popular action-roleplaying genre. Coupled with wonderfully flexible combat and a story that touches on unexpectedly profound themes, I found it hard to tear myself away from Horizon even after I’d finished its main campaign some 40 odd hours later. Horizon’s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved.  A sense of urgency is established from the get-go, as Horizon’s premise is a big mystery that begs to be solved. The questions raised by protagonist Aloy and the primitive, feral machine-infested open world she inhabits kept me guessing throughout: what’s at the centre of it all? Although Horizon suffers from occasionally corny dialogue that belies its smarts, the broader ideas it prods at - the nature of creation, for example - are remarkably ambitious.  Aloy’s personality helped me care about her journey on a more personal level. Nimbly voiced by Ashly Burch (known for her performance as Borderlands 2’s Tiny Tina), she’s a charming character to watch and play as because of the wry wit that tempers her big-hearted heroism; some of my favourite smaller moments came from Aloy’s sarcastic interactions with other characters who didn’t get the joke. Though you have some say on the way she responds to situations in the interests of dialogue flavour, she remains largely a well-intentioned character, which is in step with Horizon’s broader story.   There’s much more flexibility to be found once Aloy’s out in the big wide world. Horizon’s combat is its most compelling feature, thanks to the variety found within 26 distinct species of animal-like machines that roam its great far-future expanse. These beasts have several weak points that can be scanned using Aloy’s Focus (a lore-friendly device that gives you Witcher-like heightened senses), and hitting different points can have different results that change the way a fight plays out. Horizon's combat is its most compelling feature.  Send a piercing arrow into the bulging ‘cargo sac’ of a giant fire-spewing Bellowback, for example, and you'll set off a massive explosion. Down a flying, ice-shooting Glinthawk by destroying the armoured sac on its chest to temporarily freeze the bird, or shoot the cannon off the back of a tiger-like Ravager and pick it up to blast a T-Rex-esque Thunderjaw, who you only just noticed approaching from the corner of your eye during the fight. It’s breathless stuff, and there are no hand-holding tutorials telling you how to best approach the beasts, which makes for more rewarding wins.  After I learned how to fight competently, Horizon continually made me feel like a ridiculously accomplished warrior without sacrificing the vital sense that every major battle could easily result in my death, in large part thanks to the ferocity of the machines themselves. Though they patrol on set routes, even the 'herbivores' will immediately attack when you’re spotted, and will continue to scan for you if you manage to find a hiding place. On the offense, these robotic beasts are authentically animalistic. Snapmaws – enormous, mechanical alligators – will swipe with their tails and spew ice blasts from their mouths, while tiger-like Ravagers will charge at you with alarming speed for a full body slam up close. Dodging their attacks requires constant use of Aloy’s roll move, all the while using the quick on-the-fly crafting system to build ammo specifically to counter the threat. Her upgradable bows feel great to use thanks to her Concentration skill that slows down time.  For Aloy’s part, her arsenal is largely tricked-out ‘primitive’ weaponry. Her upgradable bows and elemental-infused arrows - your primary weapon - feel great to use thanks to her Concentration skill that slows down time, allowing for dead-eye aiming. She also has access to a handful of more elaborate devices like the Ropecaster, which shoots out ropes to immobilize enemies, or the Tripcaster, a weapon that creates explosive tripwire traps at a range. Though these more creative weapons sound great in theory, in practice they’re annoyingly slow and fiddly when you're up against multiple threats, and I found the most challenging machines were too fast and too powerful to use them in a genuinely effective way. Fun to play around with on weaker enemies during more casual hunts, then, but far from crucial when you're up against a wall.  Not that Horizon encourages you just to blindly wander into every fight and start shooting. A lot of the machines roam in packs, with larger beasts flanked by velociraptor-like sentry bots called Watchers, so if you’re not careful you can be outnumbered and devoured within seconds. To counter this, there’s generally a silent path to take: hiding in swatches of tall red grass and drawing machines in gives you a chance for a stealth kill, and if by some misfortune you’re spotted, Aloy’s Concentration skill is vital in helping you land an arrow right in that Watcher’s prying eye before you make a quick escape. It’s a shame luring specific machines away from their packs is so time-consuming, though; often simple hunts for a single animal evolve into massive fights against several types. Alternatively, Aloy doesn’t have to do all the work herself, as she’ll discover how to override the machines’ brains in the field while exploring her world (to tell you how would ruin a wonderful surprise). Overriding has different effects depending on the machine - some become docile mounts, for example, while others will fight on your behalf, killing their own kind. As you upgrade your skill tree, these overrides can last for longer, which allows you to essentially build up a small army of loyal, vicious steeds. Watching them wreak havoc on the field from a place of safety is smugly satisfying.    You don’t just fight machines in Horizon. While not as engaging as their mechanical counterparts, there are human targets too - many of whom populate the bandit camps peppered throughout this massive open world. Though you’re free to take them on as you please, I found it’s best to take a stealthy approach through the tall grass and pick off these heavily armed NPCs one by one. That’s a largely satisfying approach, aside from the fact that, like in other half-stealth games like Uncharted 4 or Watch Dogs 2, you can’t hide bodies. It’s a design decision that sticks in my craw when an NPC’s curiosity piques after he or she spots someone sprawled on the ground with an arrow sticking out of its chest from a mile away. Clearing these enemy camps is one of the many incidental side activities scattered across Horizon, a variety which also includes digging in ancient bunkers for clues from the past, tracking machines through dedicated hunting grounds, and climbing to the top of a giant brontosaurus-like Tallneck to unlock more of the map. It’s nothing we haven’t seen before in other games of this ilk - the Tallneck is basically a walking Far Cry tower - but thanks to the promise of XP and loot that you can trade for currency to buy better weapons, it’s all very compulsive.   Horizon's ‘post-post apocalyptic’ landscape itself is beautiful and terrifying. On top of that, Horizon's ‘post-post apocalyptic’ landscape itself is beautiful and terrifying, so journeying through it in search of things to do between main quests - not that you ever have to go too far - is usually a reward of its own. Snowy vistas, autumnal forests, and vast deserts are stunningly realised, even capped at 30 frames per second as it is. (That’s true on PlayStation 4 Pro as well, where it runs in a stunning 4K mode.) Frozen mountain peaks or the calcified remains of a skyscraper make for eerie, quiet jaunts, made more unnerving by the Lost World-esque horror that sits in Horizon's underbelly. One of the most thrilling moments in my playthrough was when I got lost early on, skirted too close to the water’s edge, and accidentally walked across the giant tail of a half-submerged Snapmaw before sprinting to safety with sweaty palms. Being killed in Horizon isn’t Dark Souls-style punishing, but as you save via spread out ‘campfires’, the threat of death also equals the threat of losing some progress. It’s enough to make these moments of terrifying discovery into Horizon’s ‘water cooler moments’ – the ones you look back on and shiver. Aloy moves about the world with near Uncharted-like ease, too. Developer Guerrilla have done a great job at making her base movements - such as climbing, rolling, rappelling down cliff faces - fluid and responsive. Though I noticed the occasional pop-in and judder, Horizon’s visuals keep up with Aloy, and impressively, I didn’t notice any significant glitches in its massive open world.   Elsewhere, settlements and camps form a rag-tag civilization. Humans of this world have been reduced back to a tribal state, and each tribe has its own identity shaped by historical victories and grievances and various theories on the nature of their strange existence, devoid of a sense of their true history. Guerrilla has done an enormous amount of seductive world-building here, and I spent a great deal of time just wandering around settlements listening to elders tell elaborate tales of gods to children or seeking stories of misplaced vengeance in the crowds. Main missions cleverly weave current-day politics into a quest to solve the mysteries of the old world.  It’s at these settlements that you’ll be given your missions, both the urgent, high-stakes main quests and the side-quests that pop up as little exclamation marks on you map. While the latter are as lengthy as the main missions, they do  quickly fall into regular fetch-quest patterns: go and find this thing, kill some things, return, collect reward. Though these make for a great excuse to destroy more machines and there is the occasional compelling storyline, I would have liked a little more originality to keep them from blurring together into one, and better rewards for completion in the late game, where XP ceases to matter next to the search for frustratingly scarce useful weapon mods. Main missions, on the other hand, cleverly weave current-day politics into a quest to solve the mysteries of the old world. I found myself switching between chasing the ghosts of the past in the deep, lonely bunkers of lost technology and solving the murder of a tribal leader, using my focus ability to track bloodstains and trace clues before facing off against a tribe of cultists in a climactic battle. Horizon encourages you to chase your own story, but help others a little on the way too. Its ultimate reveal - prior to a frenzied, heart-in-the-throat finale - is smart and provocative, and a great pay off to the journey.  Across a vast and beautiful open world, Horizon Zero Dawn juggles many moving parts with polish and finesse. Its main activity - combat - is extremely satisfying thanks to the varied design and behaviors of machine-creatures that roam its lands, each of which needs to be taken down with careful consideration. Though side questing could have been more imaginative, its missions are compelling thanks to a central mystery that led me down a deep rabbit hole to a genuinely surprising - and moving - conclusion.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/03/divide-review	" Divide kicks off with a firefight—a chaotic squabble where sentry robots resembling metallic metroids snipe at two protagonists who fire back with guns that bark lightning. It's glorious and promising, if a little tough. But it's the followup moments I find more representative of my time with Divide, in which I roamed aimlessly through a sprawling train station with roomy passages that go nowhere with only an easily missed verbal clue from a past conversation for directions. It's that confused wandering that I remember most about Divide, and it overshadows this isometric RPG's moderately lively dual-stick combat and decently fascinating science-fiction story; strengths which are further tarnished by a clump of bugs and a few iffy design decisions.  I enjoyed the story well enough, even when the voice acting swung wildly from decent to awful. This is the story of David, a widowed Mr. Normal from modern-day Los Angeles whose armor takes hours to get any more substantial than a blue blazer, and whose little daughter who goes missing after he dons a pair of high-tech contact lenses found in a mysterious package from his late wife. Divide is at its best when it highlights the difference and distance between David's humdrum reality and the trippy metallic fascist police state he lands in, and there's a believable build in tension as he meets new people and finds new data about his wife in terminals he hacks with his nifty lenses. Yet awkwardness creeps in even here, whether it's in the voice work that often doesn't match up with the subtitles or in the occasional shifts from an isometric perspective to eye-level view for a cinematic effect in conversations. Sometimes these shifts work, particularly when the camera opts for a 2D view requiring nothing more than left and right flicks of a thumbstick, but they tend to cause confusion when they shift to more artsy angles. In the first such sequence, I spent a few moments bumping into chairs and invisible walls before I realized I was supposed to aim at a very tiny, specific spot and pull the right trigger in order to chat with the chap seated at the table. From there, I was greeted with a good number of conversation topic choices with the guy (although slightly awkwardly on account of Divide's insistence on using only the DualShock 4's thumbsticks, bumpers, and triggers for every action).  I always looked forward to these little snippets of story. I always looked forward to these little snippets of story, and in hindsight after completing the 11-hour campaign I wish there were more of them. Instead, the bulk of Divide consists of lonely, repetitive hours aimlessly walking through a labyrinthine underground complex, steering David with the left stick and clamping down the right trigger to aim his contact-lens scanner in order to uncover hackable terminals (which yield ""hashes"" to power even more hacks) or boxes filled with credits for upgrades. Very early on, I geeked out when I discovered the scanner sometimes revealed ghostly messages on the walls and cheered whenever I at last amassed enough hashes to unlock a terminal that opened a new door. But Divide excessively relies on this concept to the point of boredom. By the time I'd moved to the second big area I'd grown weary of backtracking to dig through every terminal and box for more credits and hashes and recoiled at the idea of the doing it again. Most of the time, I was more concerned about figuring out where in the hell I was supposed to go, which Divide makes much harder than it needs to be.  Hacking into specific workstations unlocks floor plans that are accessible through the DualShock 4's touchpad, but even then the often-vague objectives left me backtracking over acres of narrow territory for some clue as to what I was missing. Sometimes, the only hint as to what was terminal or door you're supposed to find next gets dropped in a snippet of dialogue so quick that you’ll miss it if you sneeze – and even if you hear it clearly it sometimes isn’t much help.  A recurring bug blacks out a whole level when David marches up certain stairs. Complicating matters further still is a recurring bug that blacks out a whole level when David marches up certain stairs, leaving you to guide him blindly through experimentation. Important stairwells often end up hidden behind walls or furniture. The maps David downloads have zoom buttons that apparently don't work. At other times, Eris – the key NPC companion who tags along with David and shoot things when he needs her to – would completely disappear from the screen. (She's definitely not supposed to.) She's essential to furthering the plot, and yet sometimes I could only find her by carefully scanning for signs of a conversation box with the right trigger. Perhaps all this backtracking and rummaging wouldn't be so bad if Divide sprinkled these long searches with a greater variety of gameplay and enemies. Exploration is supposed to be one of the chief attractions here, but hours go by when it's just David against variations on the same metallic corridors and the same metallic bots. On the few occasions when David instead finds himself in a cozy apartment or on a thin bridge showcasing the decayed highrises of a future Los Angeles, the visual shifts feel almost merciful.  Fortunately, it's usually fun to kill the bots. David never gets more to use besides a upgradeable super-powered stun gun of sorts, but – when I could get it to work properly – I enjoyed using it to blast apart the robots or (later) knock out human enemies. Much of the fun comes from the risk created by the gun's need for a several-second recharge, and that quickly forced me to learn how to use corners and other environmental elements to line up good shots. The options get more lively as David picks up upgrades or buys them from vending machines he reactivates, giving you abilities like causing the robots to explode remotely or commanding one to fight against the other.  Divide encourages you to avoid combat altogether if you can. Sadly, the combat never feels fluid no matter how many upgrades David stuffs into his device.The twin-stick controls are prone to misses and skips, and always feel fiddly at best. Sometimes the flighty A.I. causes the drones to sit there while David jogs around them. Divide also encourages you to avoid combat altogether if you can, but this has nothing to do with interesting stealth mechanics. Instead, it merely involves running past drones or running up behind them and hacking them into hibernation. Early on, I enjoyed toying with the approach, but as the hours flew by I found that combat became effectively unavoidable. Worse, stripping the exploration of action just rubs in the repetitiveness of the scenery even more.  As a saving grace, the music's fantastic. Chris Tilton, known for his musical work on Assassin's Creed: Unity and SimCity, wears the caps of both composer and co-game designer for Divide, and he's clearly in his element in the former. The subtle orchestral music drenches Divide's abandoned darkened corridors in ominous moodiness, and stirs emotion even when the voice acting falls flat. It's therefore strange that it’s not more more generous with its use. Looking back, nothing convinced me of the awfulness of those long, half-aimless backtracks through Divide's corridors like the occasional absence of musical accompaniment, which left me alone with nothing but annoyance and David's ceaseless footsteps on the tiles. There's a decent science-fiction story holding all of Divide's pieces together, but it's not quite strong enough to outweigh the disappointments of excessive backtracking through repetitious metallic levels that barely look different from the last. A great musical score and a moderately interesting combat help keep it interesting, but bugs and repetitive encounters made the campaign feel much longer than it needed to be."
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	 Nioh owes a lot to Dark Souls. That’s a phrase you hear all the time these days, but in this case it’s more accurate than most. From its demanding but rewarding combat to its labyrinthine levels full of thrilling danger and secrets, the influence of FromSoftware’s action RPG series undeniably forms the foundation for Team Ninja’s latest endeavor. But Nioh also boldly asserts a fresh and surprising identity of its own with an intricately layered combat system that allows just enough room for customization while still adhering to the interesting constraints of its stamina-based framework, forcing you to adapt your playstyle by the second. A welcoming variety of foes to face, clever bosses to take down, and a story that’s equal parts endearing and terrifying make every step in Nioh’s long journey even more exciting than the last.  Nioh’s story functions mostly as interesting flavor for your adventure. You play a fictionalized version of real-life sailor William Adams, who becomes an almost comically inexplicable demon-slaying action hero in the Sengoku period of Japan. William is sadly underdeveloped, but his adventure through the foggy mountainsides, war-ravaged villages, and hellish battlefields of 1600s Japan is captivating thanks to appearances from other famous historical figures like the mysterious Hattori Hanzo and the fierce Tokugawa Ieyasu.  Nioh has the ability to shift seamlessly from lighthearted to epic to terrifying. While I never felt invested in William’s personal story, I fell in love with Nioh’s colorful cast of characters and the epic scope of their collective journey, which sets an awesome tone for more than 70 hours of adventure: a quirky mix of history and fantasy that brings an unexpected lightheartedness to what initially seemed like an overly straightfaced action game. I especially appreciate its ability to shift tones so seamlessly. Nioh’s intentionally silly side never gets in the way of its truly epic and terrifying moments, which are in abundant supply — particularly in the final quarter, as it hurtles full-speed towards its thrilling conclusion.  With effectively two tutorials and myriad systems, menus, and enough skills and item shortcuts that you need to hold down R1 as a modifier to access them all through the controller’s face buttons, you’d think Nioh would seem overwhelming at the start, but the way its opening acclimates you to each mechanic is a thing of beauty. The Tower of London, where we first see our hero, William, breaking free from prison, teaches you the very basics of combat and movement, while the standalone (and conveniently skippable) Dojo tutorial runs down the more complex stuff involving stances and managing your Ki meter. Tons of handy optional training missions provide a deeper understanding of Nioh’s many systems, including melee combat, ninjutsu, and onmyo magic. While it’s easy to get the hang of these on your own, doing the missions provides some nice skill bonuses that make taking the time to run through each one worth it.  All missions – including main missions, the many exciting side-missions, and training missions – are accessible in an overworld screen that pops up after you’ve completed a level. That gives you much-needed time to breathe, upgrade weapons at the blacksmith, and buy items. While I was initially worried that the disjointed approach to progression would deny a sense of movement through the world, the striking variety of environments more than makes up for it. Each self-contained area is a visually distinct, intricately laid-out space that’s dense with meaningful combat encounters.  Interesting levels make exploration a fun and important part of the journey. Even the most generic levels, from a cliffside cave network overrun with crafty bandits to the many war-torn villages of the countryside, have some interesting spin that distinguishes them from the last. But the more unique levels are unforgettable — like a deadly, trap-filled ninja mansion and a sprawling, bloody battlefield crawling with demons. Checkpoint shrines respawn enemies each time you visit one (think bonfires in Dark Souls), but the winding pathways, looping shortcuts, and hidden secrets of each level make exploration a fun and important part of the journey in both main and optional side missions.   Nioh's charm is a nice surprise. One of my favorite things to hunt down in each level are the adorable kodama tree spirits. You can guide them back to your shrine for some useful perks, making them more than just cute collectibles. They’ll sit atop your shrine, dancing and whistling a tune with little cracked bowls on their heads. It’s a silly bit of respite after an exhausting run from checkpoint to checkpoint. I didn’t expect Nioh to be charming, but its nonsensical brand of comedy in the face of overwhelming odds and terrifying enemies was a nice surprise that carries into the gameplay as much as its entertaining cutscenes.    Nioh’s combat is where it shines brightest. It combines the slow-paced and position-based nuance of Dark Souls and the precise, combo-executing thrill of a fighting game to create some of the freshest and deepest melee action I’ve experienced in recent memory. I’d put it right up there alongside Dark Souls and Bloodborne — what it lacks in the purity that makes those games so strong, it makes up for with an even more demanding tactics-based approach that allows it to stand boldly on its own. That’s owed entirely to its Ki system and the compelling dynamic it produces with its weapon options and stance-based fighting styles.  Nioh's many combat mechanics play off each other in strategic harmony. In the world of Nioh, Ki is your attack force — effectively a stamina bar that drains when attacking, dodging, blocking, and taking damage. What makes it unique is your ability to execute a timing-based move called a Ki pulse to regenerate stamina mid-fight, reminiscent of Bloodborne’s rally system for health, but much more urgent. The more perfectly timed the pulse, the more Ki you have the opportunity to gain back. Executing a perfect pulse has other advantages, too — just one of the many ways individual mechanics in Nioh play off of multiple others in strategic harmony. Certain yokai (demons) can create what’s called a Yokai Realm, which is an area-of-effect spell that significantly slows your Ki regeneration and adds an extra challenge to fights. The only way to regain Ki in a Yokai Realm is to do a Ki pulse, and if you can pull off a perfect one inside the realm, the realm will disappear.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	 As wise people often say, you can learn a lot from the past. But ironically, despite being a retro-inspired sequel to the fondly remembered arcade and NES games, Double Dragon 4 patently ignores the lessons of history. It slavishly works to emulate, both in look and controls, a game that was quickly iterated on and left behind by a slew of other arcade beat ‘em ups. Even compared to the classics that immediately supplanted its predecessor, Double Dragon 4 feels shallow and dated. Ostensibly, its appeal is the nostalgia trip it takes you on, but this is immediately undercut by the fact that it takes all of its cues from the comparatively weak NES port instead of the far superior arcade version. Animations are stiff and lifeless, enemies look generic and unthreatening, and then there are the manufactured technical issues. I can appreciate the effort it takes to build in visual glitches like screen tearing and flickering for the sake of authenticity, if you’re attempting to faithfully emulate an old game. But here, in a modern-day sequel, it just makes everything look uglier for nostalgia’s sake.  Despite taking its artistic inspiration from the console version, Double Dragon 4 takes pages straight out of the book of ‘80s quarter-munchers, which is to say: it’s cheap as all hell. Off-screen enemies you can’t see are all too happy to hit you without recourse, and enemies will lie in wait atop ladders or over your downed body to take cheap shots as you rise, leading to nearly unavoidable damage. This wasn’t a good time back in the ‘80s, and it certainly isn’t in 2017.  At least you can get up with some invincible moves to clear a couple of enemies out, but the remaining ones will follow up afterwards and knock you right back down, creating a frustrating cycle of inescapable beatdowns. This wasn’t a good time back in the ‘80s, and it certainly isn’t in 2017. That isn’t to say that there’s a challenge here, though. You can employ the very same cheap tactics to the generic goons that shuffle slowly forth to stop you. It’s easy to trivialize many of the fights just by repeating the same sequence of moves over and over. But this kind of combat is no more enjoyable when dishing it out than receiving it. The only respite is that, like the games that came before it, you can beat Double Dragon 4 in less than an hour, and even with a friend along for the ride that’s about as much time as I wanted to spend with it. I am certainly not immune to the charms of 80s and 90s game design, but the NES version of Double Dragon wasn’t a great example for Double Dragon 4 to follow. It’s not just that this simplistic beat-em-up formula didn’t age well graphically or mechanically, it’s that it simply isn’t very fun or engaging to play in 2017.
Jonathon Dornbush	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	 The awkwardly titled Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8: Final Chapter Prologue is meant to set the stage for the long-awaited Kingdom Hearts 3, but this collection will really only be of value to those who are already well versed in all things hearts and heartless. Without that background, dropping into this collection at this point would likely leave amateur keyblade wielders in a confusing place. Final Chapter Prologue is composed of three portions: 0.2 Birth By Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage, Dream Drop Distance, and Back Cover. The first of those three, a mini-chapter that fills in the gaps of Aqua’s history, is 2.8’s most exciting and rewarding aspect. Exploring what happens to Aqua after the events of the 2010 PSP spinoff, Kingdom Hearts: Birth By Sleep, A Fragmentary Passage is a genuinely fun and exciting three-hour glimpse at what Kingdom Hearts 3 could be. Fighting with Aqua feels powerful, and chaining together magic and physical attacks against enemies small and large is the series’ combat at its best. Each Kingdom Hearts entry tweaks the real-time combat, but A Fragmentary Passage’s take works in an intuitive and engaging fashion that encourages a fluid flow that’s mirrored by Aqua’s fierce yet almost ballet-like movements.   Exploring the Dark World, where Aqua finds herself trapped, is also a reminder of what the Kingdom Hearts series’ best levels are, harkening back to the design of the original Kingdom Hearts and its direct sequel. The franchise’s weakest worlds, often found in its spinoffs, have felt like little more than a series of flat, hollow rooms, but A Fragmentary Passage’s Disney World-turned-dark delivers a visually imaginative environment on a much grander scale. Each subsection of the Dark World has branching paths, treasures hidden in nooks and crannies, and a verticality that encourages exploration. The campaign also offers a welcome twist on some of the most overused enemies in the series, introducing a scale that I found genuinely intimidating in the final moments. The Dark World is a grand reminder of what Kingdom Hearts' best levels can be.  Speaking of that ending (without spoiling where it goes) I was surprised at how directly A Fragmentary Passage seems to lead into Kingdom Hearts 3. I certainly came out of Aqua’s journey as excited for the sequel as I was when I first finished Kingdom Hearts 2, though now the still-nebulous release date of the third game feels more aggravating than it did back in 2005. So while A Fragmentary Passage is a truly fun glimpse ahead, it is still a short one that doesn’t necessarily merit jumping into this entire separate collection (which is different from the one coming on the series’ 15th anniversary in March). Aqua’s journey includes optional side objectives which unlock costuming options for the keyblade master, but outside of the fun visual component these alterations don’t have an affect on gameplay. (Still, being able to change the color of Aqua’s outfit, add awesome armor, and give her Minnie Mouse ears is an enjoyable addition that I wouldn’t mind seeing applied in future installments.)   But the impact of Aqua’s journey, while enlightening, for Kingdom Hearts 3 remains uncertain at this point, and didn’t radically shift my understanding of the series’ story so far – and the same feels true of the other two portions of Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8.   When the spinoff Kingdom Hearts: Dream Drop Distance originally came out on the Nintendo 3DS in 2012, IGN gave it an 8.5, saying: “Despite its problems, Kingdom Hearts 3D: Dream Drop Distance is an enjoyable experience with an engaging story and incredible characterization. Although the platforming is far from fluid and the story can feel convoluted at times, when KH3D soars, it soars high - capturing that KH magic that has propelled the series to great success for a decade now. Dream Drop Distance captures the quality of the console releases, but in bite-sized chunks fit for a portable, and successfully whisks players away to the world of Disney films like Hunchback of Notre Dame, Pinocchio, Tron: Legacy and more. Overall it’s a great new entry in the series, one befitting Sora and Riku’s return. With the excellent additions of Flowmotion combat and the Drop system, this may be the best portable entry in the series to date.” This 2017 remaster is surprisingly clean, polishing up the handheld game for the PS4 so that it compares well to the previous updates of the Nintendo DS and PSP games in previous Kingdom Hearts collections. The original version’s touch-based systems have also been translated well enough to the traditional controller setup, with occasional awkward use of the DualShock 4’s touchpad. But because none of those controls are all that necessary to Dream Drop Distance’s moment-to-moment real-time RPG action gameplay, they’re not much of an issue. The very fun Flowmotion combat system remains a blast.  Some of the additions Dream Drop Distance made to the series, such as Dream Eaters, which are party members that can be trained like a cross between Pokemon and Nintendogs, are still relatively uninteresting. Meanwhile, the worlds themselves, while impressively big for handheld games of their day, are noticeably sparse at times. But it’s a decent Kingdom Hearts spinoff that makes good use of the very fun Flowmotion combat system, which turns virtually any surface in the world into an opportunity to attack enemies in creative ways.   Again, its story is more table setting than meal, though, as Sora and Riku are put through the paces of the Mark of Mastery exam to become true keyblade masters. For those who want every bit of Sora’s story ahead of Kingdom Hearts 3, it’s certainly worth a playthrough, but those who have already experienced the 3DS version won’t have much reason to return here.   Lastly, Kingdom Hearts χ Back Cover is an animated movie that fills in some of the story dating back to the earliest portions of the Kingdom Hearts mythos, some of which was previously explored in the mobile and browser game Kingdom Hearts Unchained χ.  The film is well animated, which bodes well for the cutscenes of Kingdom Hearts 3, and the voice cast includes some fun performances from Travis Willingham (Harvey Dent in Batman: The Telltale Series), Ray Chase (Noctis in Final Fantasy XV) and more. But it’s an often-slow build to a conclusion that leaves just as many questions open as it attempts to answer. The segmented, chapter-by-chapter unfolding of the story both works in its favor by making it easy to watch all at once or spread out over time, but ultimately translates into an only intermittently engaging experience. Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue is the most far-reaching package of content in the franchise, stretching from the series’ earliest moments all the way to its most recent, but an understanding of its scope requires some history with Kingdom Hearts lore. And because much of it touches on familiar territory, as a whole it lacks an essential feeling that the main numbered entries and spinoffs (like Birth By Sleep) evoke. A Fragmentary Passage is a truly exciting glimpse through the door to Kingdom Hearts’ future. That look ahead is a wonderful appetizer for what’s to come, but hopefully that tease, along with the rest of the tablet setting done here, doesn’t make the wait for the full course that is Kingdom Hearts 3 more difficult in the long run.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	" ""Why do you think that birds fly?"" This riddle is posed in the first hour of Tales of Berseria, the emotionally ragged semi-prequel to Tales of Zestiria that ripped my heart out again and again with its cautionary tale of a woman so bent on vengeance that every road she follows leads to perdition. By the time the credits rolled on this 45-hour long action RPG I still wasn't sure what the answer was, but I knew this: Berseria is the best Tales game I've played, and my favorite to date. Berseria's greatest strength lies in its ability to tell a different kind of story from those of its predecessors. Instead of the cheery, can-do spirit I've come to expect from the series, Berseria fully explores the darkest parts of the human heart. There's no real sunny side to the anti-heroine Velvet Crowe, who drives the plot with her unquenchable thirst for bloody vengeance on the man who took everything from her. Nor is there much hope of redemption for the memorable company she keeps, which includes the enraged pirate Eizen, the mouthy and detached witch Magilou, and the fratricidal demon Rokurou. These characters reflect just how emotionally broken their world has become in the face of multiple calamities. Only the fragile Malak (spirit) Laphi and the earnest Exorcist Elenor keep this ragtag group anchored in hope and distinct from the actual villains. Even then, the ties that bind them threaten to come undone as their search for the truth behind the theo-political machinations of a tight group of elites collides with their need for personal vengeance.   Berseria fully explores the darkest parts of the human heart.  At first I had a hard time believing the people Velvet kidnapped, cajoled, or manipulated into following her had reason to stay by her side as long as they did. Then, as their personal tragedies unfurled and the characters indulged in the usual dialogue skits Tales is known for, I began to understand their growing camaraderie. I smiled whenever Rokurou and Eizen disagreed to agree, laughed at Magilou's tactless jokes, and held my breath nervously whenever Eizen and Velvet clashed over what to do next. (""If you die, you die alone,"" the pirate growls ominously during one very tense scene.) Each character is given sufficient time in the spotlight and with each other, which allowed me to invest in their well being as individuals and as a group. I can barely remember the names of any Tales heroes that came before Berseria, but I feel like I'll remember this motley crew for a long time to come.  While Berseria flips the script on Tales' normally sunshine-filled stories, the brawler-inspired combat stays pretty much the same, with a few welcome tweaks that make it feel smooth and responsive. A variation of the Linear Motion Battle System that lets you run around a 3D battlefield returns, but now instead of using a move-governing mechanic, each action is tied to a character's Soul Gauge, which depletes every time a party member performs a special skill (Arte) in battle. Depleting a character's Soul Gauge allows enemies to more easily deflect attacks, while maxing out a character's Soul Gauge allows you to activate Break Souls, a temporary state where a character's combo limits are ignored and they can use a unique set of skills – such as Velvet's hard-hitting Consuming Claw-to take a bite out of the enemy's health and inflict a status effect.  Although the Soul Gauge will replenish over time, I found it much more fun to hurry the process along by pounding souls out of an enemy while trying to avoid a similar beatdown. I really like this new system because it adds a bit of sensible strategy to the gameplay without feeling like I'm being forced to conserve or use up energy just for the sake of it.  Battles have a more cohesive flow. A few other nice features include how Artes are conveniently hotkeyed to the Playstation 4's face buttons and can be swapped out at any time, more responsive blocking and dodging, and the ability to spend points tied to the Blast Gauge meter. These points either trigger a character's fun-to-watch Mystic Arte (My favorite is Magilou's Ascending Angel, where she stretches a paper doll to impossible lengths and then slaps the crap out of multiple enemies on the battlefield) or can be partially allocated to activate Switch Blast, where reserve characters gain a combat advantage-such as an extra soul-whenever they switch places with an active party member. These additions give battle a more cohesive flow, helped by a mostly well-behaved camera and enjoyable music. (For those who enjoy playing with friends, superfluous but serviceable multiplayer during battle is also available.)  The only issue I had was learning the terms and conditions for when and how to effectively use Break Souls and Switch Blast. It was tricky, but once I deciphered Berseria's playbook I had a hellishly good time dishing out punishment to lizardmen and wolves, and I got immense satisfaction using the scraps of metal and ingredients they left behind to enhance equipment and whip up mouth-smacking, stat-boosting feasts between battles. I had a hellishly good time dishing out punishment to lizardmen and wolves.  The one place where Berseria doesn't shine as brightly is the garden-variety locations and lack of deep exploration. Our ragtag adventurers travel across lovely but linear flower fields and dreary marshes connected by nodes, or via a ship that travels around a large archipelago on a 2D map.  While I appreciated the occasional ocean cliff to ascend or colorful puzzle dungeon to solve, for the most part I was pretty bored by the generic scenery. Lots of mandatory backtracking and limited fast-travel didn't help, even with the introduction of the ""geoboard,"" a clunky magical surfboard that let me get from point A to point B a little faster than normal. There were a few things that managed to keep my sense of exploration alive. One was the unlockable treasure chests containing collectible costumes scattered throughout the world. These cat-eared, bubble-gum pink ""Katz Boxes"" made me squeal with delight whenever I saw them, and I became obsessed with gathering magical orbs called Katz Spirits to try to open as many as I could. Minigames and battle arenas that helped sharpen my combat skills were also a welcome reprieve from the tedium of ping-ponging between the same areas, and I enjoyed sending a pirate ship around the world to collect new recipes and valuable treasure for me. Berseria gives you the choice  of hearing Japanese or English, and it’s a good thing I went with English. Not because the Japanese cast failed to perform well, but rather because the subtitles are incredibly strange. Lines like “That’s gruesome by any standards” became a chuckle-worthy “that’s goose by any standards,” and “even death can be a kind of release” became “even depth can be a kind of release,” turning the adage into a riddle. Was this the devious doings of autocorrect? A clumsy translation?  Who knows, but it was a needless distraction. Luckily, the English voice cast hits it out of the park, and their strong deliveries were able to evoke a wide spectrum of emotions in me, including tears and belly laughter. It’s proof that a good voice cast can make all the difference in how much I enjoy the story.  Tales of Berseria is a surprisingly strong showing for this long-running series. Its tragic story of broken people fighting on the wrong side of history makes it utterly compelling, and its well-tuned combat more than makes up for its lack of interesting environments. Simply put, this is a tale too heartbreaking to miss, or to forget."
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	 The plot of Yakuza 0 is served up like a fresh bowl of udon noodles; simmering, full of twists and turns, and satisfying to the end. While I very much enjoyed the bone-cracking street fights, numerous oddball side characters, and the Lonely Planet guide’s worth of entertaining diversions along the way, it’s really the taut tale of betrayal and the bitter arm wrestle for power at its centre that kept me glued to the controller throughout. Yakuza 0 is set in 1988 and serves as an origin story for two of the series’ most prominent characters, Kazuma Kiryu and Goro Majima, who find themselves caught up in a land war amongst rival clans. Whereas the previous game in the series, Yakuza 5, juggled five different storylines and felt somewhat convoluted as a result, Yakuza 0 benefits from focusing on the plights of Kiryu and Majima, each scorned by their respective families and whose paths ultimately converge in the end.  It’s a gangster tale that adheres mostly to convention, with menacing mob bosses, car bombings, blackmail, and the like, but it’s a tale told well and told thoroughly. Much like the Metal Gear Solid series, Yakuza 0 isn’t afraid of taking control away from us for extended periods in order to deliver a lengthy cutscene to advance the plot and develop the characters, but I never felt in any way detached from the events onscreen thanks to the strong performances of the actors and the consistently powerful writing.  Recent open-world releases struggle to compete when it comes to the sheer density of detail packed into Sega’s latest. Although the slightly wooden character animations serve as a reminder that this is a game developed to straddle console generations (the Japanese version was simultaneously released on PS3), Yakuza 0 otherwise manages to nail the look and feel of its Tokyo and Osaka-inspired settings. Recent open-world releases like Mafia III and Watch Dogs 2 might dwarf the maps of Yakuza 0 in terms of scale, but both struggle to compete when it comes to the sheer density of detail packed into every nook and cranny of Sega’s latest. The neon-soaked streets tread a fine line between gorgeous and garish, the Don Quijote discount stores are claustrophobic caverns of consumerism, and vendors on the street keep handing you pocket tissues for no apparent reason. While Yakuza 0’s retro setting isn’t exactly Grand Theft Auto: Vice City when it comes to revelling in ‘80s nostalgia, there are enough nods to the era to reinforce the sense of time and place - from the pagers used by the characters to the authentic Walkman billboards and the playable OutRun and Space Harrier games in the local arcades.   These arcade games are just the tip of the time-sinking iceberg. As is now customary for the series, Yakuza 0 always provides alluring C, D, and E options when you’re on your way from A to B. There’s fishing, bowling, batting practice, several kinds of gambling, pool, darts, karaoke, dancing, underground fight clubs, and plenty more.  The bulk of these optional activities are well realised and fleshed out with fun challenges to complete, and they range from the addictively simple reflex-testing batting cage to the relatively deep real estate business run by Kiryu in Tokyo and Majima’s hostess bar empire in Osaka. The latter two management simulations in particular require a substantial time investment but yield maximum yen, and while I only scratched the surface of them on my way to completing the 30-hour story, I intend on returning to them in Yakuza 0’s post-credits ‘Premium Adventure’ mode in order to find out exactly how lucrative they can become.   Of course, a more direct way of nabbing fistfuls of cash is by using your actual fists (and feet) to beat it out of the neverending supply of street thugs who engage you in a scrap on sight. Kiryu and Majima each have three different fighting styles that can be switched between on the fly, and I relished in the ability to tailor my technique to suit each individual scenario. For example, I found Majima’s button-mashing breakdancing stance that turns him into a human whirligig of spinning kicks to be perfect for carving through crowds of enemies, yet his baseball bat-toting slugger stance is a better choice for one-on-one boss fights where more powerful and direct attacks are required.   Yakuza 0’s fighting system is wonderfully brutal, and the context-sensitive finishing moves offer an especially satisfying way to curb-stomp a shoe-shaped exclamation point into an opponent’s face at the end of each encounter. However, a somewhat piecemeal counter system means that for all its flashy moves, the all-in brawling is never quite as fluid as the one-on-many fighting experiences of the Batman: Arkham games, at least when it comes to transitioning back and forth between enemies. This makes Yakuza 0 seem a little behind the curve in that regard, which is disappointing considering we’re now half a dozen games into the mainline of the Yakuza series. What Yakuza 0 does have in common with the Caped Crusader, though, is the fact that neither of these violent gangsters ever actually kills anyone. Each enemy that Kiryu and Majima dispatch is left to pick up their teeth rather than push up daisies, which is refreshing given that most open-world crime games are effectively exercises in casual mass murder. (Not that killing stops me from enjoying those games; it’s just nice to play something that approaches it differently for a change.) The general lack of killing in Yakuza 0 means that when certain character deaths do occur over the course of the story - whether they be good, bad, or grey - they land with significantly more impact.   Contrasting nicely with the heavier themes of the main storyline are Yakuza 0’s side quests. There are around 100 of these mini-missions to hunt down across the two main city settings and they’re typically lighthearted if not utterly ridiculous. I particularly liked teaching the members of a wannabe punk rock band how to talk tough ahead of a meet and greet with fans (and deliberately feeding them the wrong lines with hilarious results), and bluffing my way through a job as a producer on the set of a television commercial.  Even though a number of these side missions are merely simple fetch quests, they’re almost always worth your while purely because the quest-giving locals are so hilarious to interact with. Indeed half of them seem like they've wondered off the set of a Japanese game show, and I was particularly fond of the perpetually pelvic-thrusting Mr. Libido who seemingly shows up every now and then purely to unleash a string of snicker-worthy sexual euphemisms. Overall, I enjoyed meeting with the eccentric supporting cast of Yakuza 0, and often went out of my way to seek them out because I knew I would typically be in for a surprise. Yakuza 0 is another sprawling entry in the open-world series, packed with an extraordinary amount of things to do and centred around a genuinely compelling crime story. Since it’s a prequel, it’s also unburdened by the series’ increasingly intricate backstory and thus far more approachable for newcomers than the last few Yakuza games. While its melee combat may lag slightly behind modern genre standards, Yakuza 0 still hits far more than it misses and is a big, bold and bruising tour through the Japanese underworld.
Miranda Sanchez	http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/10/gravity-rush-2-review	 You wear a lot of hats in Gravity Rush 2. Kat assumes the role of a photojournalist, firefighter, private investigator, stunt double, miner, and so many more, but most of all this sequel sees her transform into an even more powerful magical gravity-defying girl and friend. New features, environments, and well-written side quests refresh and greatly improve the feeling of falling forever in Kat’s second journey, and only a few control and storyline issues weigh it down. If you haven’t played Gravity Rush and care about the story, this is not the one to start with. The sequel picks up with little introduction, finding Kat and her friends Raven and Syd stranded in a new vibrant land called Jirga Para Lhao, and it’s boiling over with conflict. The first act is great because of the time it took to develop new characters and let me explore the city, but unfortunately the second falls a little short. It feels underdeveloped compared to the first and third, and introduces one somewhat important mystery that’s left completely unsolved. I have a feeling that the answer I want is in the side quests, since one does have you investigating some details about the mystery, but even if it is, it’s a silly way to resolve a problem that was established at the beginning of the story. The third act does resolve a majority of the questions from the second act (though in a shaky fashion) but is otherwise a satisfying ending.  I enjoyed how Gravity Rush 2 subtly focuses on different kinds of relationships between powerful pairs of women, both in and out of battle. Raven rejoins Kat on her journey, this time as an ally, and their dynamic and dependence on each other is sweet and battles are a lot more fun with her there. Fighting alongside Raven is another good dash of variety, and even though she’s powerful it’s balanced so that the fights aren’t too easy. You have to take down a good variety of enemies (mechs, soldiers with rocket launchers, tons of familiar Nevi, and huge bosses that change as you learn other gravity styles) so learning how to best fight against them with Raven and the new gravity styles kept me interested in combat throughout the entirety of the lengthy 30 to 40-hour campaign. There are also a few other pairs of women that have different familial relationships, but carry through the same theme of working together to find strength when the world is being torn apart. Even though Raven is powerful it’s balanced so that the fights aren’t too easy.  Each place Kat visits is full of life thanks to Gravity Rush 2’s jazzy music and bright design. The new city has such drastic changes between each of its island districts, which are separated vertically instead of like Hekseville’s more horizontal layout. As soon as I was dropped into the island city I spent at least 10 minutes exploring and collecting precious gems that power up Kat’s abilities. They’re everywhere, and hunting them is addictive. I left paths for missions every time I saw a few gems trail off in another direction and I got to explore areas I wouldn’t have otherwise. (That burning building can wait just a few more seconds.) As I moved through the city I unlocked manholes that’d teleport me to other areas, but I hardly ever used them. Using Kat’s gravity powers to fly around is way too fun to want to fast travel. I loved visiting the high, rich islands only to dive to the market far below that grows beautifully in detail as I approached. Only a few areas had issues loading textures and objects when I dropped in from higher areas, but was otherwise a smooth experience.  The new gravity styles Kat learns as you go greatly change how she falls. Gravity Rush 2 offers ample time to master the original style before moving on the the light and bouncy Lunar style and then the heavy and forceful Jupiter style. Flipping between the three in more challenging fights made Kate really feel like the she had reached her full potential by the end, and I felt powerful having mastered them. And because of those styles, you now have even more control over her speed and levitation than in the first Gravity Rush, so once those come into play falling becomes just as important as flying because you can use it to conserve energy and travel farther. The improvements also make fighting more interesting by offering creativity options with Kat’s movements. Side missions provide a unique look into the lives of each city’s resident.  There's a ton to do in the city with new challenge missions, chatting with select NPCs, and of course, side missions. I had a hard time skipping side missions. They provide a unique look into the lives of each city’s residents and offer varied assignments. Some had such a long story to tell that they were broken up into multiple parts, but the shorter one-off missions were cool too. I got to help a journalist report on an illegal deal and join schoolgirls in a demonic ritual. The Gravity Queen does a little bit of everything. Kat doesn’t spend all her time in the city, though. Gravity Rush 2 takes her to a challenge area somewhat similar to the original’s Rift Planes where Kat has the opportunity to learn new skills and grab a ton of precious gems. When I went to learn my first of two new gravity styles I was thrown into a beautiful, dark area that was lit by giant ammonite candles. It looked like I was traveling in a forgotten underwater trench. These imaginative areas act as fun, helpful tutorials for the new gravity styles.  Not all of Kat’s new tools are great, however. I dreaded the few missions that required me to use gravity sliding over a long distance. It’s a hard power to control. There were also a few unfortunately long missions in smaller spaces that made the otherwise cooperative camera a pain. Gravity Rush 2 also sees the return of online leaderboards for the challenge missions, but my favorite new online feature is the treasure hunt. I used photos submitted online from other players, taken using a camera Kat gets early on, to find cute chests filled with all sorts of loot. It’s a cool, creative way to earn a few extra gems while exploring different parts of the city. After a couple of story hiccups, Gravity Rush 2 righted itself and pulled me in with the personality of its world and wide variety of activities. The new gravity powers and styles make combat exciting, and well-written side quests and character relationships grant better insight into Kat’s universe. After 40 hours I found it hard to put the controller down, and I can’t wait to jump back in to finish every sidequest I can find.
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	" Werewolves Within takes the popular party game ‘Werewolf’ (or Mafia) and transforms it into one of the only remarkably welcoming, social VR experiences available. It’s a successful ""port"" of an already very tactical and thought-provoking game of deception, but being hosted in a virtual world offers unparalleled accessibility. Unfortunately, it also comes with some very inhibiting technical issues that mar it considerably. Werewolf, the social game that Werewolves Within seeks to replicate, is about a werewolf trying to hide their identity amidst a group of villagers, while the villagers try to discern who among them is the monster. Werewolves Within facilitates the social setting you need to play it in, with an interesting variety of fantasy-inspired worlds. Without VR, it usually takes a social event and a willing group of people to play, but being able to opt in online with the PSVR makes it wholly accessible, even for friends or family living miles apart. Jumping in through the Quick Start option either immediately puts you in a virtual lobby with other players, or has you observe other matches while you wait to play - it feels organized, and easy to get into the madness.   Each player sits around a circle, and is represented by a unique cartoon avatar. Despite the competitive nature of Werewolf, and the fact that accusing people of lying is the sole mode of progress, I didn’t encounter a single hostile person playing, and I think that’s likely a credit to these virtual avatars. Their expressions react impressively to players’ tone of voice, giving them a visual identity that completely humanized every person I played with.  Expressions react to players' tone of voice.  After just an hour of playing with, and getting to know a group of complete strangers, I actually came to imagine that they might look just like the cartoon men and women that represented them. The detail in the avatars’ animation gives life to the setting as well, which plays heavily into VR’s uncanny ability to make you forget you exist outside of the game world. It even takes advantage of VR mechanically, too, by allowing players to talk to the person next to them without anyone else hearing by simply leaning in their direction.   There is a small learning curve when it comes to remembering the game’s roles and how they work with, and against each other. They’re randomly allocated at the start of each round, and some feature special abilities - the Tracker, for example, can lean to the right or left to confirm if there is a werewolf on the corresponding side. You are provided a virtual book that contains notes on each of the roles if you forget, but that’s when our first bug appears. If more than one player stands up at the same time (which you can do to silence other players), the book will disappear for a period of time, making it impossible for new players to know the rules without having them explained. That’s tough, because games aren’t very long, and every second you waste explaining the rules makes a significant dent on the progress your group can make.  It's just a little too fast-paced.  This is compounded by the fact that there’s only one round instead of the usual two in the original Werewolf, which makes figuring out the monster’s identity feel rushed. The villagers have just seven minutes to discuss roles, and who to kill, and then the game ends. It’s not uncommon for the timer to run out during deliberation, either, meaning some players often miss their chance to vote. It’s just a little too fast-paced, and some of the more satisfying logical discussions that the format usually promotes are cut short.   That’s doubly frustrating when the PSVR has major mic problems, to the extent that players tend to need to ask people to speak one by one in the lobby just to make sure their mics are working. It’s a really odd bug, because if you leave the lobby and re-join the game the mic will work, but as a result, every single game is slowed down. Of course, a game that depends almost entirely on good audio also has its fair share of issues - background noise from one player or a bad connection from another dramatically affects everyone, because there isn’t a quality filter. When it works and none of the seven players have any audio or connectivity issues, Werewolves Within is competitive, surprisingly friendly, easy to jump into and even easier to play for hours on end, building up an active repertoire of new online friends as you go. When it doesn’t work, though, it’s inexcusably hard to play, and that’s unfortunately very often."
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	" Let It Die is essentially Dark Souls reimagined as a free-to-play roguelike, with a monetization scheme that sounds incredibly predatory on paper. And yet, for many hours at least, it never really threatens to empty your wallet. It's got clunky combat and a nebulous sense of progression, but it initially showers you with premium currency and wraps it all in a enticingly weird and violent package. The appeal wears off in time, but in its chaotic first dozen or so hours it achieves something like magnificence. The bizarro setting is partially to thank for that. Let It Die embraces the increasingly popular view that the world could go down the toilet in the next few years, specifically after some tectonic cataclysm in 2026. On an island outside of Tokyo, the Babel-like ""Tower of Barbs"" shoots up to the skies, ringed with skyscrapers and populated by baddies with dreadfully poor AI all trying to reach the top. Others shoot through underground tunnels in subway cars while hooked up to skin-piercing tubes straight out of The Matrix, and you start off by choosing whichever one of these lab rats suits your fancy.  If that's not strange enough for you, consider that I learned about all this from a consistently entertaining Grim Reaper-type who calls himself ""Uncle Death"" and cavorts about on a skateboard and calls me ""senpai,"" all while dropping hints in balloons during a tutorial that seems to go on for hours. And then Let It Die goes meta, pulling back from the action to reveal that I'm actually playing a game in a sad old arcade where a bored waitress sends me off on quests to kill this or that NPC in-game. But Uncle Death exists here too, making cracks in his cool accent. Is he just a cosplayer, or something more sinister? Does the actual tower exist outside the arcade? Let It Die is at its best when it prompts dreamlike questions like these, and it might have been a masterwork if all of its elements achieved similar success. Let It Die is at its best when it prompts absurd, dreamlike questions.  Sometimes it stumbles in the strangest places. Your goal in Let It Die is to join the ranks of the savage souls climbing the tower, with each floor growing more challenging as you ascend via elevators and escalators. Part of the appeal is that these floors randomize in roguelike fashion each time you visit, which would be cool if most of Let It Die didn't rely so heavily on minor variations of the same steel and brick corridors to the point of nausea. Rarely do these areas come close to matching the personality of the ""waiting room"" where you can rest or bring blueprints to order new gear. Here you’ll find a seductive pole dancer who sells stickers that grant boosts or a robotic cephalopod that plugs into you and lets you allocate stat points when you level. Enemies aside, the playable world beyond the waiting room comes off as bland by comparison, looking only about as weird as the backstage of a high school theater.   Fortunately, Let It Die manages to sustain its attractive absurdity in other ways, though with varying degrees of success. For instance, you regain health by chomping on giant frogs or grubbing for mushrooms, some of which are poisonous or can be lobbed like grenades. It’s delightfully bizarre, but you’re forced to interact with these bits with the DualShock controller's touchpad, a frustratingly awkward method that once found me gulping down an explosive fungus rather than throwing it. It's funny early on, but the laughs stop when you lose a character you’ve carefully poured hours of time and effort into over so simple a mistake.  Let It Die’s wild variety of weapons—which include everything from hot laundry irons to fireworks launchers—are another part of its odd, macabre charm. Weapons and armor that drop off of enemies usually have the durability of tissue paper though; it was never long before my latest toy would break, which meant I rarely had time to decide if I actually liked using a steel bat before I'd have to switch to chainsaw fists or a ridiculous pistol that looked like something the Joker would bring to a shootout. You can pick up blueprints to make sturdy new ones back at the waiting room, but they eventually end up costing so much that it's usually best to scavenge. It's annoying at times, but I begrudgingly came to enjoy how it constantly forced me to change my strategies and thus prevent any sense of repetitiveness from setting in. If you try to play it like Dark Souls, you should generally prepare to die.  It also works because Let It Die's combat lends itself to this kind of chaos. Its animations certainly look like those of Dark Souls, but Let It Die's design rarely encourages the kind of careful thinking and well-timed rolls that Souls fans so adore. Rather, I enjoyed Let It Die the most when I approached it as an aggressive hack-and-slash, carving up enemies before they had a chance to beat on me while jamming to Akira Yamaoka's phenomenal soundtrack. Played this way, Let It Die it provides hours of ridiculous fun. Unfortunately, if you try to play it like Dark Souls, you should generally prepare to die. Dodging sometimes sent me in the opposite direction I wanted, or didn't respond at all. The cumbersome melee lockon oddly only works as intended if you're actually aiming the camera at the target, which is made all the worse by Let It Die's practice of swarming you with enemies who stunlock you with abandon.   And then, yes, usually you die. Here's where Let It Die gets tricky. As its title implies, Let It Die doesn't want you to get attached to anything, which can ruin any meaningful sense of progression in the long run. We've already seen this approach in action with weapons and gear, but Let It Die extends it to the characters you play as well. They're expendable, a point driven home by the way you store multiple fighters on hooks in a ""freezer"" for later use, or in the way the late game makes you abandon the fighters you spent hours with for ones with higher level caps. This technically being a roguelike, you're theoretically supposed to just ""let them die.""  You can save them, either by paying Uncle Death some gold back at the freezer (and thus getting back all their gear) or paying premium ""Death Metal"" currency to revive right at the spot where you died and continue hacking and slashing as though nothing happened. If you don't, they wander around as NPC ""haters"" who attack both other players and you (although you can win them back—minus their gear—if you beat them). If you manage to keep them alive through all this, you'll still probably lose them in the ""Tokyo Death Metro"" PvP feature, which sounds cool on paper but which I found infuriating in practice. Essentially, other players in groups organized by region can invade your base when you're offline and run off with your stashed goods and, yes, playable fighters. As its title implies, Let It Die doesn't want you to get attached to anything.  That's a ton of opportunities for loss, which naturally invites a ton of opportunities to spend money in a free-to-play game. Somehow, miraculously, it took me well over a dozen hours before I found this started to ruin the fun. Let It Die practically shovels Death Metal at you just for logging in, making it easy to trade it in for gold (AKA ""kill coins""), extra storage space, ""free"" elevator rides, or for those precious immediate revivals, which can mean all the difference in a boss fight. At the higher levels of the tower, though, death comes often, partly because of the huge numbers of players who leave their high-level ""haters"" wandering the samey halls with crazily effective machetes, likely because they have no money to revive them. Sometimes you'll even find these high level haters wandering the newbie-focused lower floors of the tower. So then you die again, and the cycle continues. If you're like me, eventually you'll reach a point where you just walk away and, well...let it die.   Let It Die has numerous rough edges, but it manages to entertain through the sheer force of its weird personality and its varied, if clumsy combat. The controls are often clunky and there's rarely a meaningful sense of attachment to characters or gear, but its characterizations and settings often manage to keep the pain of the poorer stuff down to a minimum, at least for a while."
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	 The Last Guardian has the highest highs and lowest lows of nearly any game I’ve ever reviewed. When it works, the bond I forged with my furry and feathered friend Trico is unlike any other. Part playful companion, part protector, navigating Team Ico’s gorgeous, melancholy world alongside this birddog is something I will never forget. But between those moments, The Last Guardian is a mess of wonky controls, a poor camera, and some annoyingly finicky puzzles. Director Fumito Ueda’s spiritual successor to Ico (review) and Shadow of the Colossus (review) touches on many of the same themes -- isolation, companionship, and sacrifice. Like in its predecessors, The Last Guardian throws you into a mysterious world with a story open to interpretation and built mostly on symbolism. I was constantly driven to continue pushing forward throughout the 12-hour journey, and I’m happy to say that the payoff of the final 90 minutes made the whole thing worth it. But the heart of The Last Guardian is the bond between the nameless boy and the unusual giant hybrid animal Trico, who has more life and personality than nearly any other A.I. companion I’ve ever seen in a game.     Watching Trico grow from a scared, savage beast to an immensely loyal protector provides a wonderful character arc. Like an actual pet, Trico has a mind of his own, but he’s usually predictable. Subtle touches, like way he shakes off after he’s wet or stretches his legs after you make it to a more open area, give him a life of his own. I found myself occasionally just standing in place and watching Trico paw at a group of butterflies or reach up on his hind legs to sniff at low-hanging tree branches. When he’ behaved as he should, I found myself legitimately on my way to forgetting that Trico wasn’t a living, breathing creature.  Watching Trico grow from a scared, savage beast to an immensely loyal protector provides a wonderful character arc. You don’t have direct control of Trico, but can prompt him with a series of commands and gestures that nudge the beast to jump, swipe, or head in a general direction. A lot of these are done while you’re climbing on top of him, which mirrors that main, memorable mechanic of Shadow of the Colossus. Grabbing onto a tuft of feathers as Trico leaps from ledge to ledge can be oftentimes thrilling, but at the same time, the simple act of dismounting him is cumbersome. Many times I found my attempts to get back to solid land were thwarted by getting caught in my cute companion’s weird underbelly. I use the word “vague” before, because even as the credits rolled, I still didn’t feel like I had a firm grasp of how to get him to do what I wanted or needed. Herein lies one of The Last Guardian’s most conflicting features: I love the concept of not possessing or physically maneuvering Trico, in that it preserves the feeling that he’s an independent and intelligent creature. Entering an environment and figuring out what he can climb, destroy, or interact with requires a healthy dose of careful observation.   The problem here is that there were countless times where I’d mentally solved a puzzle and knew exactly what to do, only to find that Trico stubbornly refused to go to the spot I needed him to get to. Whether he was facing the wrong direction and refused to turn around or was just a few steps to either side of where he needed to be to initiate a jump, I became exhausted by his refusal to heed my commands. A little bit of this obstinance added to Trico’s charm, but it happened far too often, so most of the time it just bombarded me with frustration and made me lose any feeling that I existed in this world. If I try a solution to a puzzle for 10 minutes only to find that I was trying the wrong thing, that’s my fault; if I try a solution for 10 minutes only to find that it suddenly arbitrarily works because of a slight readjustment to Trico that was beyond my control, that’s just plain annoying. Aside from some light platforming, a bulk of the obstacles in The Last Guardian come in the form of puzzles like scouring an area in search of food for Trico or destroying the stained-glass eyes that terrify the beast. There are also enemies in the world that you’re mostly defenseless against on your own, so you’ll have to figure out how to lure them to Trico, or vice versa. It reminded me of the way you had to protect Yorda in Ico, but this time around you’re Yorda and have to rely on Trico’s A.I. to keep you from being taken away. It’s an interesting twist on the formula, and one that does a great job of bringing Ueda’s trilogy full circle.   If you’ve seen any footage of The Last Guardian, you’ve seen for yourself that the vast outdoor environments are nothing short of stunning. The colors, lighting, and architecture are unlike anything I’ve seen outside of Team Ico’s games, and they especially shine during the thrilling chase sequences. Watching bridges collapse as you narrowly escape danger, all under the beauty of a wonderful lighting system that adds incredible depth to the world, is fantastic. This, coupled with a moving and memorable score, made for a whole mess of unforgettable moments in the 12 hours it took me to complete it.  Be prepared for the camera to be completely blocked by screens full of feathers, walls, and foliage. But then you go indoors, and many of the cramped interiors feel drab. Worse, they highlight The Last Guardian’s glaring camera issues. Given that you’re generally right next to a giant creature, be prepared for the camera to be completely blocked by screens full of feathers, walls, and foliage on a regular basis. It’s rare to even have to think about the camera in a third-person game in 2016, but I found myself constantly being pulled out of the experience trying to wrestle with my point of view. When you’re trying to deal with that and the floaty controls at the same time, it blows a lot of the good will that’d been built up by the outdoor areas. I can’t count the number of times I got stuck while trying to scurry up Trico’s back, or even trying to dismount the critter. It feels noticeably inelegant, especially when compared to the beauty and awe of many of the other scenes. The divide between the highs and lows of The Last Guardian is staggering. For every wonderful moment of absolute beauty and emotional attachment to its lifelike companion, there’s an equal and opposite baffling moment that ruins the mood with frustrating controls and camera angles. But I found myself willing to put up with all of these hiccups if it meant experiencing any of its multitude of incredibly-beautiful moments.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	 Killing Floor 2 wears its heart on its sleeve—a bold move considering there’s no ace stuffed up there. The few things it does, it does boldly and unabashedly well. It’s a fast, fun co-op shooter with cool classes, satisfying guns, and aggressive, grotesque enemies, all doused in fitting heavy metal music. However, zoom out from the gorefest a bit and you’ll see Killing Floor 2 is also an online shooter with only two modes, two boss battles, and some unnecessary time sinks. It’s not a buffet though; it’s comfort food, meant to be eaten again and again and again. With that mindset clearly front and center for developer Tripwire, Killing Floor 2 delights on the back of its great gameplay. Killing Floor’s 10 classes, awkwardly referred to in-game as “perks,” are distinct and fun to play, and putting together a good team has a huge impact on whether you’ll succeed. The first class to hook me was the Field Medic, which passively gains armor and movement speed, wields weapons with secondary-fire healing darts, and gains the ability to self heal while healing others. I felt incredibly strong and useful, as I did with each class given enough time to unlock their abilities.  One class is a demolitions expert, with access to explosive pistols and C4; another spews fire on everyone and everything, making for a great crowd controller. They all become fun and useful eventually, but the biggest problem is that they don’t begin to feel distinct until level five when you unlock your first special perk, which can easily take two to three hours of play. Until that point, you’re really only working with your passive bonuses which haven’t yet scaled well because of your low level. Combined with the fact that any class can wield another class’ weapon, it’s going to be a while before your role feels powerful and solidified - I’d say around level 10, when you unlock your second skill, which will likely take around six hours. Putting together a balanced team, and seeing how well you do remains fun time after time.  So, if you’re interested in a class but you’re not sure if it fits your style, you can easily put in the time of a short-ish shooter campaign only to learn that you don’t care much for it. That’s simply too much time to waste. You can level up classes you aren’t even playing, which is a good touch, but that progress is very slow and it forces you to buy odd weapons or play in ways that don’t line up with your equipped class. If you’re into Killing Floor for the long haul, it might matter, but the bonuses I saw from this throughout 15 hours of play were negligible. Once you do find a few classes you like, you can really dive into what Killing Floor is all about: killing stuff with your friends, earning money (or “Dosh”), buying better guns and armor between rounds, and doing it all over again. Gearing up, putting together a balanced team, and seeing how well you do remains fun time after time.   Killing Floor is great at replicating those moments in movies where everything is going very wrong for our heroes. You might look around and see that, over by the bus, a zombie is gnawing on the medic’s leg while others close in for a bite. The sharpshooter up on the ledge doesn’t see the cloaked enemies sneaking up behind her. The heavy-duty commando is holding his own for now, but his ammo’s low and he’s about to be vomited on by a huge, bloated monster. Everything is frantic and on fire, and pulling through with your class abilities, limited weapons and ammo, and some good old-fashioned teamwork (and yelling) is incredibly fun. So fun that, if you’re not bothered by a lack of variety (think MOBAS, which are often played in one mode), there’s enough here to keep you entertained for a long time.  Thanks to Killing Floor’s over-the-top sound and graphics, weapons are satisfying to use—and not just the big ones. This is crucial because most classes start with tiny guns and spend their Dosh every round for bigger toys, like a grenade launcher or a microwave gun. They’re well designed, loud, and their bullets have a huge impact on whatever they hit. Enemies blast apart and flail wildly before their bodies are lost beneath a sea of incoming foes. I’m not a big rock or metal music guy, but the music fits the action well, and firing an auto-shotty off to chunky guitar riffs just works on an original DOOM-cover art level. Killing Floor 2's weapons are satisfying to use—and not just the big ones.  Despite the trigger-happy approach to combat, it becomes much more tense and tactical the more you play. Ammo and equipment are limited. Sometimes ammo can be found around the map, and certain classes stock you back up but it’s not common enough, nor is the resupply large enough, to let you be totally reckless.  There’s a constant friction between struggling to survive by spending your precious resources or conserving your goods for the next (tougher) round. It’s tempting to spend the first few rounds using only a pistol or melee weapons, though on higher difficulties you’ll risk getting overwhelmed, and if you die because you’re hoarding the good ammo you’ll lose your Dosh survival bonus for the round. It’s fun to test yourself and see what you can get away with. You’ve already seen all of Killing Floor’s enemies before if you’ve played other zombie survival games, though what’s there works very well. Aside from a few types of standard fodder, there are bloated vomiters, invisible melee Zeds, huge dudes with chainsaw arms, screaming witches, and more. Some get right in your face, some cut off your mobility by grabbing you or spewing bile, and others get you just when you feel safe. You’ll quickly learn how to deal with all of them, even though they keep things interesting through sheer, overwhelming numbers. The final wave culminates with a boss fight, a difficult battle with tons of potential for crushing letdowns and clutch finishes. Because of their huge health bars, brutal attacks, and tendencies to single out one poor player (#justmedicthings), bosses rip apart teams that don’t work together or that have a poor balance of classes. One boss, The Patriarch, punishes targets with a minigun that shreds armor and health bars in seconds. As he slowly dies, he’ll eventually cloak, run away, and recover health if you and your team don’t focus and keep on his trail. Another boss fires off canisters of poisonous gas that can segment the battlefield and keep teammates from assisting each other, making him especially dangerous on maps with lots of hallways or other choke points. Spreading out and using the map to your advantage, while also staying in communication to heal and resupply each other, makes these boss fights a great, tense test of your skills unlike the garden variety Zeds that came before. Unfortunately, those are the only two bosses in the game. After playing for only a few hours, you’ll know their introductions, their goofy voice lines, and their attacks. This doesn’t turn them into easy prey though, and the fights are a fun, difficult test every time. Still, more variety would have been nice.   Killing Floor’s other main mode, Versus Survival, is there for anyone who needs more competition. Players are split into two teams: Zeds and humans. For the humans, it feels largely like business as usual. For the Zeds, it can be a really good time or a really bad time depending on the creature you’re randomly assigned. Smaller monsters can feel underpowered, but playing as a bigger unit and wrecking everything is good for some laughs.  With longer matchmaking times and tons of players dropping and joining mid-match, Versus Survival absolutely feels like the secondary, less important mode, though. It’s fun, but until some of the weaker Zeds feel viable, I wouldn’t recommend taking it too seriously. In a time when shooters are competing to have the most modes, the biggest campaign, the most guns, and generally the most “stuff,” along comes Killing Floor 2, totally unconcerned with running that race. Its lack of modes and bosses will eventually turn away anyone but the most dedicated of fans, but its foundation is so fun and rock solid that, even if you only plan on playing for a few weeks with your friends, there’s plenty here to enjoy.

Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	 “Work smarter, not harder” is something I would have loved to tell the team at Bandai Namco behind Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization. That’s not to say there aren’t plenty of smart ideas in this action-based, single-player, faux MMO, but its tangle of gameplay systems feels like a dense pile of stuffing that never gets stitched together into a coherent whole, and its story lacks the urgency and gravity that made the anime great. Hollow Realization takes place after the main story arcs of the Sword Art Online anime series, and sees its many likeable characters return to a virtual world that’s in many ways reminiscent of Aincrad, where they were once horrifically trapped.  The show’s original premise, where perishing in-game resulted in real-world death, is a setup that immediately introduced tangible stakes and a sense of urgency - two things that Hollow Realization sorely lacks. At first, I enjoyed the fact that the characters weren’t in any immediate danger; I relished the opportunity to see them relax and actually enjoy their game for once, especially given how the opening cinematic strongly implies that the other shoe is going to drop momentarily anyway. But after dozens of hours of casual camaraderie over farming runs and item shop bargain-hunting I grew impatient with the story’s snail-like pacing and relentless cheer - both of which betray what made the anime great. I grew impatient with the story’s snail-like pacing and relentless cheer.  I certainly can’t fault the amount of story content though, which is both fully voiced and quite plentiful - so much so that 50 hours wasn’t enough for me to see its completion. It’s the style and frequency with which the story is presented, though, that makes it feel obtrusive. At times, it felt like I could barely play for more than an hour without being stopped for long stretches to watch mostly static character portraits talk at each other. I get it: they’re all friends. That doesn’t mean I want to get roped into a 15-minute-long dialogue scene over what kind of food one of them wants sell at her in-game shop. My pre-existing affection for the characters was enough to keep my attention initially, but before long my event log was clogged up from pending conversation events with party members - which I dutifully started ignoring so I could get back out into the field. Out in Hollow Realization’s large and interconnected combat zones, enemies are plentiful, as are randomly occurring events for you to participate in for extra XP and sometimes a shot at a rare high-level monster. Though the events are mostly simple “kill X of these” quests, they gave shape to my exploration and kept me coming back to areas I’d already cleared in search for better item drops. That focus on rewards became vital as I opened up the six main areas, each of which house 10 to 20 roamable areas. It’s an overwhelming amount of real estate to cover, which adds quite a bit to the fake MMO veneer.   The one-button combat seems simplistic at first, but there are a number of little nuances that prove worthy of the time required to master them. Properly timing the last hit of an attack chain gets you a sizeable damage bonus, while perfectly parrying incoming attacks stuns your attacker while replenishing your mana, giving you the resources and time you need to press the offensive. Landing a special attack within a certain window while an enemy recovers from using one of theirs temporarily weakens them, opening them up to bonus damage from all sources. Moments like this are perfect opportunities for commanding your AI party members to coordinate their assaults with yours. Communication goes both ways too; they’ll prompt you to switch places with them, attack in unison with them, and more. It’s even possible to remind them to heal, ask them to draw aggro, even take evasive maneuvers when you see a big AoE attack inbound. Leveraging all of these little elements properly allows you to efficiently down groups of enemies well above your level, and perfectly reading a powerful foe’s attacks and shutting them down while building a long, damaging combo feels really satisfying.  The big area bosses simultaneously represent the zenith of Hollow Realization’s combat systems, and the most concentrated expression of what’s wrong with them. They’re hulking in size, and their multi-formed assaults require you to work with three other parties of AI-controlled adventurers just to have a chance. This would be exciting if those other parties had half a brain, but more often than not they get themselves wiped in the opening minutes of what sometimes amounts to a 20-minute battle. Finishing the fight on the strength of your party alone is certainly doable with the right tactics/gear, but the over-zealous auto-targeting system doesn’t help either. Finding a short window of opportunity to attack a specific limb of a boss only for your character to sail past it to hit another definitely made certain bosses more frustrating than they needed to be.   Underpinning the action are a group of systems designed to both simulate many elements of MMORPGs and to provide ways for you to build your relationships (romantic and otherwise) with your party members, and even random NPCs. Here especially, it’s clear that the developers put a tremendous amount of effort into the nuts and bolts of Hollow Realization - a fact that makes the lukewarm results all the more disappointing. There’s plenty of complexity here, but very little of it makes the experience significantly deeper.  For instance, by complimenting your comrades in battle you can encourage certain personality traits in them which, over time, affects the frequency with which they perform certain types of actions and a slew of other stats and effects. Right there, I’ve just given you about as much of an explanation as the game gave me. Even after figuring some of it out contextually and checking both Japanese and American message boards, no one seems to fully understand what all of these icons and stats actually mean. As a habitual min-maxxer, I was as surprised at my inability to fully comprehend this system as I was that my inability to do so wound up being irrelevant to success. Skill trees and the oddly nuanced blacksmithing system suffer a similar problem: their menus are a mess of icons, numbers and abbreviations with little to no explanation. The description for the skill “Decoy” reads: “(Mob)Aggro Down (CRT) -10% / 30sec. Increase Aggro” What?! I know what a mob is. I know what aggro means. I can surmise that CRT means “crit,” and not “cathode ray tube.” But what is the supposed relationship between them here? Do my critical hits lower the target’s aggro while this skill is active? Do they just generate less aggro? If so, why does it say “Increase Aggro?” I ran a heavy crit build and I never noticed any difference in monster aggro after popping Decoy, so I guess the fine details are irrelevant anyway? I love getting lost in the minutiae of RPG skill trees, but not if they’re unintelligible and ultimately meaningless. I felt like I was only passively participating in the development of my character.  At least the different passive skills of the many blacksmiths you can find have an accompanying legend to tell you what they’re for, but that only revealed how needlessly opaque the system is in the first place. “Intuition” and “Eye For Detail” aren’t really great descriptors for what’s actually just a bonus crafting success chance. I ended up simply sticking with what I was able to piece together and ignoring the rest, which (despite being more than sufficient for me to succeed) left me feeling like I was only passively participating in the development of my character and his comrades.  Even after considering these shortcomings, I still appreciated the lengths the developers went towards imbuing Hollow Realization with the kind of complexity that’s usually limited to MMOs, but it also makes it all the stranger that the actual online portion is so limited. You can form a party of up to four human players online and fight super-high-level named mobs without all the story interruptions, but to do so you have to quit out of your single-player game completely and then launch multiplayer from the main menu. There was an interesting opportunity here to seamlessly blur the line between real and simulated MMOs, but Hollow Realization sadly misses it. A lot of effort was clearly put into Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization, because almost every aspect of its gameplay has an underlying set of properties and nuances to come to grips with. While I usually love that kind of complexity, here it rarely felt meaningful or even coherent. Paired with a story that lacks the stakes and urgency of the source material, it leaves Sword Art Online: Hollow Realization feeling pretty tepid aside from its enjoyable combat.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	 Almost everything about Eagle Flight is surprising. Somehow, flying high above a deserted Paris in VR doesn’t induce nausea. Somehow, quickly navigating tight environments using your head and neck feels smooth and responsive. Somehow, its in-flight escort missions aren’t frustrating, but fun. The novelty soon wears off, but what’s there reaches greater heights than many PlayStation VR games accomplish. Eagle Flight has a fantastic control system that’s easy to learn, comfortable to use, and responsive enough to allow for some seriously challenging level design. Looking around makes slight changes to your direction, while tilting your head results in large swoops and u-turns. A brief and effective tutorial showed me the ropes in no time at all, and soon I was soaring between buildings and through trees with no issues.  Even after a few hours of non-stop play, I was nausea free. That includes time at high altitude, where everything is far enough away to feel slow, and time in some of the fastest, most narrow challenge levels, where collisions can happen at any second. It’s so comfortable that I’d often ignore objectives and just fly around for fun.  Spread your arms out like a bird and listen to the Top Gun soundtrack while you’re flying. Your controller is used for speeding up, slowing down, and things like firing your “weapon” (a shriek that emits a powerful sonic blast) at enemy birds. It was smart to keep directional control entirely off the DualShock 4, as it’s simply not needed and might have complicated things. Plus, with less to worry about, you can spread your arms out like a bird and listen to the Top Gun soundtrack while you’re flying. In fact, I highly recommend doing that.   A great control system wouldn’t mean much without a beautiful place to fly though, but post-humanity Paris is a great choice for it. In fact, Eagle Flight begins with quite the strong impression. You’re flying above a city, and as you swoop lower you see zebras and bears on the streets. Eventually, you realize the whole city is green – probably too green – and then it dawns on you: people don’t live here anymore. If you’re a bit slower on the realization, an overgrown Eiffel Tower should do it. Animals and cars can look blocky, but that’s only really noticeable at low altitude. For much of the time I spent flying, the world looks great, and you have the best view in the house.   The difficulty curve is tough without ever being too frustrating. In story mode, progression through the sections of Paris is quick enough to stay interesting, and the difficulty curve is tough without ever being too frustrating. Missions range from collecting feathers (a throwback to Ubisoft’s Assassin’s Creed if there ever was one) to navigating abandoned subways to escorting injured eagles to safety -- all while fending off pesky vultures and crows with your supersonic breath blasts. None of these activities would be exceptionally fun on their own, but the flight mechanics are so enjoyable and easy to use that adding an extra responsibility or two makes for a good challenge. A few of the modes can be unreasonably challenging thanks to a narrow field of view. For example, when the crows you’re chasing learn the ability to leave behind wind traps it can be almost impossible to dodge them if the level design includes tight turns or narrow spaces. There’s also a mode that leads you through rings (yes, like Superman 64). Hitting the center of the ring gives you a speed boost, and therefore a better time and a higher leaderboard result. However, Eagle Flight only shows you the current objective ring and the next one, and the rings are often close enough together that it would be helpful to see at least the next two or three when you’re moving at that speed. Losing a mission or earning fewer stars because of guesswork isn’t a great feeling.   The four-hour campaign does a fine job of preparing you for multiplayer, which definitely has the unique factor going for it. It’s capture the flag as birds, and the flag is an animal carcass. It’s fun, but limited. With simple controls and only a handful of defensive or offensive options, only rudimentary teamwork is possible. You can defend your flag-carrying teammate using your eagle screeches, and trying to score all alone rarely works. The lack of additional modes soon gets repetitive, but like the rest of Eagle Flight, multiplayer succeeds on the strength of its controls and just how comfortable it is to play. Just don’t expect to play it for months.  Eagle Flight surprised me with how quickly I felt at home flying and fighting with other birds above Paris. It features some of the best and most responsive and comfortable gameplay available on the PSVR, though like most current VR games its appeal may be short-lived if you’re not a completionist who’s crazy about collectibles or high scores. This is a weird idea, well executed, that soars high.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	 Robinson: The Journey is a lot like Jurassic Park, and not just because it’s about dinosaurs. Its world and wildlife are engrossing and beautifully designed, and in classic Crytek fashion it’s one of the most graphically impressive games available on its platform – it’s currently exclusive to the PlayStation VR. However, when things go wrong (and they often do), they go very, very wrong. Unclear puzzles, nausea-inducing climbing, and a general lack of guidance make for an experience that’s, at best, equal parts frustrating and fun. Tell me if this sounds familiar: You’re playing a game with puzzles. After trying a handful of solutions that seem obvious, you realize none of them are going to work. Twenty minutes later you’ve resorted to trying something bonkers, something there’s no reasonable way the developers could have intended for you to do. When that doesn’t work, you begin the pixel hunt for some hidden clue or item to solve your problems. Sometimes you find it, but sometimes you fall into a tar pit or off the side of a cliff, and feel the sweet but temporary release of death before being respawned and having lost a frustrating amount of progress.   That’s the core loop of Robinson, a not-so-subtle futuristic/prehistoric take on Robinson Crusoe. The tale begins one year after your massive spaceship crash lands on an alien planet that happens to be populated by prehistoric Earth creatures. You are Robin, the lone survivor, a young boy whose only company is a an adorable hide-and-seek-playing pet T-Rex named Laika (they’re cute when they’re still small) and a floating AI ball called HIGS. He’s well acted and occasionally a bit funny, but Portal 2’s Wheatley he is not. The premise of searching for other humans is simple but intriguing enough, but it’s really all in the service of showing you new environments – which are Robinson’s double-edged sword.   No matter where you look, the world of The Journey is beautiful. Lush jungles of twisted trees of all types crawl with wildlife big and small. Looming cliffs tower overhead and bubbling tar pits look so thick and gooey you can almost smell the sulfur. And because your crashed spacecraft was quite massive, the incredibly scenic environments are littered with white and silver space-age materials which contrast well against the natural look. It’s not uncommon to peer up and see a massive section of a ship jutting into the sky like it’s another snow-capped mountain.  It feels like a space that has been lived in by a real, lonely human being just trying to get by.  Crytek’s environmental storytelling is also on point. At the very beginning, you have a moment to look through Robin’s makeshift home. It’s an excellent blend of both a life-support pod and a kid’s bedroom. Posters hang beside crucial equipment and spare parts have been assembled into makeshift gadgets like some kind of futuristic LEGO sets. It feels like a space that has been lived in by a real, lonely human being just trying to get by. Unfortunately, as I mentioned before, getting through these environments can result in literal headaches. While maybe half of the puzzles are clear enough, the other half left me wondering what the heck I was supposed to be doing, which is much different (and worse) than a good puzzle making me wonder how I’m supposed to accomplish the goal. Sometimes you need to drag a tool or a piece of debris along with you, and sometimes you can but don’t need to. When you die the checkpoints are too unforgiving, so you’re never sure if hauling something along is worth the hassle. But if you don’t take it and you need it later, you’ll need to backtrack or just kill yourself to reset the checkpoint and try again. Making you experiment to figure out how to solve a puzzle and then punishing you for that experimentation is not a good combination. There are also times where you can command Laika to roar and scare animals so they move or drop something, but that ability is so rarely used that it’s often an afterthought. Sometimes HIGS will explicitly call that out to alert you, but other times he won’t say anything at all.  There’s also the issue of trying to navigate this world and accomplish your goals, which is an unnecessary hassle. At any time you can bring up an objective list, but there’s no objective marker to follow. This isn’t a huge issue in some games, where movement feels good, but in a VR game where you’re using the gamepad to walk, lots of exploration can be nauseating. There’s no option to warp to where you’re looking, only to make the right stick turn you in increments instead of smoothly (which can be a big cause of motion sickness), so the DIY approach to finding the path forward just creates a situation where you’re forced to do a lot of needless walking. Worse, you spend a good amount of time climbing to high and low ground using a climbing minigame where you have to find and grab handholds on the rock face. But bizarrely, Robinson doesn’t have Move controller support (even though you’re carrying a device that looks a lot like one) or even use controller tracking to move your hands, so guiding those virtual hands onto ledges requires you to bob and slide your head around, awkwardly guiding them to the handholds with your nose and controlling the grip with a gamepad. Combine that movement with the fact that the ledges appear to be a few inches in front of your face (this is a first-person game, after all), and you have all the ingredients needed for a bad time. Robinson: The Journey is a beautiful world to explore, and being in the presence of dinosaurs can be awe-inspiring. However, almost everything about it that makes it a game rather than a non-interactive virtual experience is unpleasant. Slow progress and poor direction kills the momentum, extending what could be a four-hour experience into something nearly twice as long, and makes even the amazing-looking environments feel stale. The best moments, like when you think you’re looking at at wall of rock and its starts to move, or climbing a cliff and realizing you’re not alone at the top, are few and far between. As powerful as they are, they can’t save Robison: The Journey from extinction.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	 With the PlayStation 4 Pro, Sony looks to step into new territory by offering a mid-cycle, higher-power version of its successful PlayStation 4. On paper, the PS4 Pro certainly has the credentials to significantly enhance some existing and future PlayStation 4 games, but in practice, the results range from good to underwhelming depending on what game you’re playing and what kind of screen you’re playing on. Physically, the PS4 Pro packs a lot of potential in a relatively efficient space. The additional 1GB of DRAM, the second GPU, and the extra power required to feed it don’t add as much bulk as you’d imagine, or from how it looks in pictures. At 11.6 inches wide, 2.2 inches high, and 12.9 inches long, it can fit into practically all the same spaces your launch PS4 can, unless it was a really snug fit already. It is significantly heavier though, by around 30%.  In terms of inputs and outputs, the PS4 Pro sports two USB ports close together in the front and one more on the back. That third one in the rear is great for PSVR owners, since it allows them to hook it up to the PS4 Pro without using up a front facing USB. This both prevents you from having an unsightly cord constantly sticking out the front of your entertainment center, and keeps the front USB slots free for hooking up controllers or other peripherals. And unlike the recent slimmed-down PS4 revision, the PS4 Pro thankfully has an optical audio port. Dolby Digital headset users rejoice! Overall, its weight, curved lines, and glossy-finished PlayStation logo give the PS4 Pro a substantial, premium feel, but the cheap-feeling and comically tiny physical eject and power buttons betray the aesthetic just a bit. They’re also a little tough to find until you get used to their odd placement at either side of the Pro’s middle “blade.”  In terms of UI and software features, this is mostly the same PS4 you know and love, which sadly means there’s no support for 4K blu-ray playback. On the upside though, the PS4 Pro supports the higher-speed 802.11ac wi-fi band (which is also on the revised PS4) and the faster SATA III hard drive interface. The latter will potentially allow you to pull much more performance out of a solid-state drive should you decide to replace the stock 1TB hard drive the PS4 Pro comes with. The swap is just a tiny bit trickier on the PS4 Pro than it is on the launch PS4 though, thanks to the somewhat finicky-to-remove panel that guards the access screw.   Of course the big new feature is the ability to output at 2160p - true 4K resolution - but the actual resolution of individual games is up to the developers. Because of this lack of standardization, I saw widely mixed amounts of visual impact when playing on 4K monitors.  Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor and Rise of the Tomb Raider, for instance, both look fantastic with the “enhanced resolution” option selected on a 4K screen. Lighting has a wider color range and everything looks significantly cleaner, especially around the edges. Particularly with Mordor, everyone who walked by while I was playing stopped to gawk, and that’s with what is now a three-year-old game. Properly supported, the PS4 Pro can work wonders. On the other end of the spectrum is something like Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, which ups the resolution to an unspecified degree and upscales to 4K. Not only is it hard to find any appreciable difference in visual quality, but the higher resolution seemed to cause deeper framerate dips than I remember from when I played Mankind Divided on a standard PS4. And unlike some other games, there is no option to play in a lower resolution without forcing it by manually changing the Pro’s output back to 1080p in the system menu. Clearly, there are going to be cases where developers haven’t quite figured out how to best use the power of the Pro.   The PS4 Pro’s power isn’t just for people with 4K monitors – again, that is, if the developers choose to take the time to utilize it. When they do, there are some nice visual upgrades for the vast majority of us who don’t own a 4K set. The problem is, there’s no guarantee that developers will make those upgrades, and based on the existing PS4 games that have received their PS4 Pro patch so far, mileage is going to vary greatly.  Shadow of Mordor, Infamous: Second Son, and Rise of the Tomb Raider are good representations of what full-featured PS4 Pro support can look like. Each of them has a list of options in their respective menus, and two of them, Infamous and Tomb Raider, offer a high frame rate option. Especially in the case of Tomb Raider, this mode boosted performance dramatically over the standard PS4 version. Simply put, while the ambiguously named “enhanced visuals” option helps some shaders and reflective surfaces to pop a bit more, the difference was negligible compared to the roughly 50 to 100% increase in performance I witnessed in high frame rate mode. I’d love to see developers provide this option on every game going forward – but again, there are no guarantees. The lack of consistency over what enhancements you're getting shakes my confidence.  That’s the big issue here: even with the games that leverage the PS4 Pro well, the lack of consistency and clarity regarding what enhancements you are getting from game to game, and even from mode to mode, shakes my confidence. Some games let you change video settings on the fly, others don’t. Some offer high frame rate options while others stick to enhanced visuals or higher resolution. Where higher resolution games are concerned, it’s unclear what resolution they are actually rendering at and what type of upscaling they might be using. Mordor in high resolution mode supersamples on 1080p TVs for a smoother image; do other games do that and just not mention it? I don’t know, and neither will you, which is a real problem. You can read articles, check patch notes, and read option descriptions, but most of the time you just don’t know what you’re getting until you start playing – and sometimes not even then. Even Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, which is one of the first games to launch with Pro support baked in from day one, doesn’t indicate the Pro benefits in-game or even on the back of the box. The PS4 Pro is a premium-looking machine that offers a lot of extra power for developers to exploit. But right now, even on a big and brilliant 4K screen, the differences are often not stark enough to make standard PS4 owners jealous. What’s worse, there’s simply no way to reliably know what enhancements you’ll have to choose from, which is a big problem for prospective buyers who understandably want to know what kind of enhancements to expect before they take the plunge. The PS4 Pro has the raw power to potentially deliver greatly enhanced graphics, and in time, with more support, it will likely do just that, but right now, it’s just too much of a crap shoot.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	 Die-hard Dragon Ball Z fans finally have a game to feel good about. It might stumble a bit along the way with some odd design choices and rough edges, but Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2’s mix of fan service, fast-paced arena brawling, and long-term questing and progression scratch a long-standing itch for series fans. The unique and ambitious concept of the Xenoverse series really sets it apart from the rank and file of licensed anime games. It’s a three-dimensional arena brawler seated within an MMO-lite structure, which provides both the immediate fun of DBZs big battles and a broader experience of being a new Dragon Ball character that inhabits the same universe and grows gradually in power over time, just like the franchise’s greatest heroes.  Combat is at the heart of the experience, and Xenoverse 2 generally does a good job of translating the omni-directional, all-over-the-place scraps of the show. Basic chain combos can just be mashed out haphazardly, but these alone will not grant you victory. Building real combos requires a sound understanding of various cancel mechanics, and different resource meters.   Ki powers all of your special abilities, and unless you equip skills or gear that helps you build it efficiently, you'll need to be smart about when to spend it. Stamina is even more vital; it powers your defensive and evasive skills, as well as your ability to Vanish Cancel, a special combo-extending tool that's crucial for dealing big bursts of damage. Especially against human opponents, forcing foes to waste their resources and saving yours for key moments becomes the key to victory, making Xenoverse 2's brawling a lot more satisfying than it initially comes off.  In terms of execution, none of it is any more difficult than pressing a couple of buttons at the same time. But where it didn’t necessarily test my fighting-game dexterity, it did reward me for experimenting with its huge cache of special abilities, which offer a wide range of tactical options. From space-controlling abilities that help you zone out aggressive opponents, to attacks that trade away damage for the chance to inflict debilitating status effects, there are enough interesting tools to support almost any playstyle, as well as ample opportunity for counterplay. The huge cache of special abilities offers a wide range of tactical options.  Some of my enthusiasm is dampened by the wet-mop hit effects, which rob even the beefiest looking combos of much of their sense of impact. The camera is downright unruly at times too, in its over-zealous attempts to keep up with the action. Since some commands require character-relative directional inputs, this can lead to frustrating missed attacks at the worst possible moments. On the whole, though, Xenoverse 2 captures the spectacle of DBZ bouts while keeping things manageable.   Though the story won’t exactly set the world on fire, it does manage to serve as both a plausible excuse to send you on a trip through DBZ history and a sidestory that could conceivably fit into the series’ established lore. Two new antagonists and their masked lapdog are sowing chaos throughout the Dragon Ball Z timeline, changing key moments that fans will remember well. Stepping in to right them means fighting some of the show’s most iconic battles, which even as someone with a less-than-complete knowledge of Dragon Ball, was a fun way to get an anime history lesson. The story hints at some heavier themes, with Trunks in particular struggling with the opportunity to change some painful events from his past, but most of it is lightheartedly played for laughs, which feels just a little bit hokey at times.  Still, flying around the sizeable hub city, being randomly challenged by legendary DBZ characters, and slowly building my fledgling Time Patroller into an “over-9000” beast really immersed me in the world. Especially in online mode, Xenoverse 2 is essentially an MMO-lite, with other player characters flying around looking for party members to quest with and opponents to duel in pursuit of more power. That, I expect, will go on well after the 30- to 40-hour campaign is over. By the time the credits had rolled I had only unlocked a fraction of the skills and barely touched the repeatable Parallel Quests, which can be tackled offline or online with a party to back you up. There's still plenty more for me to do. By the time the credits had rolled I had only unlocked a fraction of the skills.  While it does an admirable job of providing the necessary activities and services that make an MMO experience work, Xenoverse 2 also commits a variety of small but irritating faux pas. For example, there’s no journal to track current sidequests, so sometimes I ended up manually walking back to quest-givers just to have them reiterate what they needed me to do. There’s a map that shows me where I can find new quest-givers, but the fast-travel map doesn’t have them marked, so you need to memorize their locations before opening the fast-travel menu and then picking the closest point. None of this is a terribly huge deal on its own, but there are enough design oversights like this to cause irritation and confusion that could have been easily avoided. Dragon Ball Xenoverse 2’s ambition is admirable, and though it’s riddled with a lot of silly little inconveniences, it mostly succeeds in giving DBZ fans an authentic-feeling world to dive into for the long haul. Though no individual element of its roleplaying or brawling gameplay is overly complex, taken as a whole there’s a surprising amount to consider while progressing your character, and enough to do to keep it from getting stale to soon.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	 For the past several years, Square Enix has released a landslide of Final Fantasy spin-offs with varying success: toe-tapping rhythm adventures, adrenaline-fueled fighters, and some forgettable mobile titles. Adding to the list is the cute-as-can-be World of Final Fantasy, a warm and fuzzy blend of nostalgic turn-based combat and monster stacking that had me alternately squealing with delight and sighing with boredom throughout the more than 60-hour campaign. Let’s cut right to the chase: this is the cutest Final Fantasy I’ve ever played, and I’ve played just about all of them. The vertically arranged world of Grymoire is filled to the brim with pixie-sized NPCs and cuddly, shrink-wrapped versions of Final Fantasy monsters like baby Behemoths and onsie-wearing Tonberries. Amplifying the sugary sweetness are Lann and Renn, an energetic pair of apple-cheeked twin heroes who spout pun-filled dialogue as they zigzag up and down a chain of floating islands collecting special monsters called Mirages. Their light-hearted banter imbues the increasingly bizarre story about a time divergence that could either save or doom the world with some much-needed humor. Silly 2D animation interspersed with quirky CGI cutscenes are also a welcome bit of fun. If nothing else, World of Final Fantasy has oodles of charm.  Even the turn-based combat starts off endearing. Instead of wrangling random NPCs into your party, you venture into the wild to capture Mirages, then use skill points earned in battle to evolve them, Pokemon style, via a node-filled skill board  that very much reminds me of Final Fantasy X’s Sphere Grid. Each of your twin heroes can then take two of these cuties into battle, and either stack them like a wobbly totem according to size (smallest on top) or have them fight alongside their human masters, both of whom can grow or shrink between enemy encounters to create slightly different stack formations. Stacking Mirages is a little risky because it means accumulating your allies’ weaknesses and gives you fewer opportunities to strike at enemies, but it also combines character strengths and abilities while unlocking more powerful versions of spells like lightning and fire when using monsters with similar skill sets. This is the cutest Final Fantasy I've ever played.  There are literally hundreds of Mirages to collect, and pairing the twins with everything from Moogles to Cactaur to Malboros offered a breathtaking array of ways to manipulate my combat stats for maximum effectiveness. Ganging up on enemies was definitely my prefered way to play, especially if foes were also arranged in a powerful pancake formation. Plus, it looks really, really cute. Mirages aren’t the only adorable things to collect. I smiled with nostalgia whenever I acquired special medals that allowed me to summon miniature versions of Final Fantasy heroes. Having Shelke or Celes appear in battle to deal out extra damage and buff my stats was extremely handy in the final act’s tough boss fights. And if that wasn’t enough, I was later  able to conjure oversized Espers like Leviathan and Odin, adding an extra explosive cherry on top of my already formidable flapjack formations.  Unfortunately, while there was always a steady stream of new monster friends and human champions to assemble, the repetition of capturing and evolving so many of them – especially ones with similar attributes – resulted in boredom about halfway through the lengthy campaign.  It was also a hassle having to constantly swap out so many allies to ensure everyone’s levels and abilities were up to par. Extracurricular activities, like fighting for rare loot in a colosseum or participating in sidequests involving Cloud, Lightning, and other Final Fantasy heroes helped break up some of the monotony, but it wasn’t enough to stave off battle fatigue.  Even a much-appreciated fast forward button in combat and clever button-mapping that enabled quick access to essential Cure and Esuna skills couldn’t prevent my eyes from glazing over. Towns and dungeons offer little opportunity for exploration.  Combat wasn’t the only thing to drain my enthusiasm. Towns and dungeons are little more than a series of cramped vertical corridors that offer little in the way of opportunities for exploration. In fact, one area was just series of bridge cables that shot upward into the sky, while another dungeon was a series of chains…that shot upward into the sky. I get that the design is meant to mirror the verticality of Grimoire, but it was disappointing that that a series of right angles walled me off from spelunking a fiery cave and sightseeing in Cornelia, the series’ very first town, and one that always makes me feel misty-eyed with nostalgia.   Even the hub town of Nine Hills has few areas to explore, and for reasons I don’t understand, is the only place you can shop for items. That meant schlepping it back there whenever I was low on supplies. It’s too bad areas don’t offer more variety, because I enjoyed exploring the rare bits of expanse that let me use my monster friends to find hidden treasure or flutter across gaps to snatch up loot. If there’s one upside to mindlessly pushing up on the analog stick, it’s that it allowed me to kick back and enjoy the catchy remixes of classic Final Fantasy tunes playing in the background. World of Final Fantasy is a humorous adventure that is just too cute for words, but its combat and exploration aren’t diverse enough to support a campaign nearly as long as this one. However, I did enjoy it for a long time - more than 30 hours - before it wore out its welcome.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	 Rigs: Mechanized Combat League delivers the exciting promise of big mech suits playing sports despite some stiff animations and rough visuals. The immersion can be a little too intense for some, but Rigs still manages to use VR in a smart way - making aiming and movement in its multi-tiered maps feel fluid. Ultimately, it successfully made me feel like a superstar cyber athlete even though I was sitting on the couch the whole time. But if you want to play competitively in online matches against other humans, the slow matchmaking and long load times might erode your interest.  Simple controls make Rigs easy to pick up and play. The Dualshock handles most of the mech’s movements and is a comfortable way for FPS veterans to jump, strafe, and start shooting their way through skirmishes. The only major adjustment you have to come to terms with is the PlayStation VR headset, which defaults to using your head like a right analog stick for looking and aiming. Rigs gives you the option to switch, and I preferred turning using the right stick since using my head to control the direction I was moving didn’t feel natural at first. Even with the modified setup, I often felt the edges of the cockpit UI were in my way when I lined up some of my shots. Rigs forces you to watch a lengthy, rather boring tutorial, but it’s a half-decent way to ease you into moving around in virtual reality. However, be warned: this is an action-heavy first-person shooter-style game, and if you have a history of getting motion sickness it can make you very ill. Even with lots of individual VR comfort settings enabled, like one that focuses your vision into a narrow view or others that mask stomach-churning transitions (not kidding!) I found myself feeling queasy if I played for more than 10 minutes at a time. Rigs has some lengthy load times and even longer matchmaking waits  Assuming you have a sturdy stomach though, there’s plenty of fun to be had despite the thin set of match options. You can choose between basic team deathmatch, Endzone (which is basically football with mechs and guns), and Power Slam, which is a hybrid of mech combat and basketball where you have to accumulate energy to hit an overdrive state and then survive long enough to jump through a special ring to score. I found myself favoring team deathmatch because of its simplicity, but the other two modes are equally satisfying, despite the repetitive and often nonsensical commentary coming from its play-by-play announcers. Some of my favorite moments came from close comebacks and high-drama finishes, like the time where I scored a tie-breaker goal after dominating two opponents with mere seconds left on the game clock. Events like this stay with you long after you take off the headset.   Online matches perform well, but Rigs has some lengthy load times and even longer matchmaking waits as it searches for suitable opponents. This can lead to a lot of downtime with nothing to do and a VR headset strapped to your face. You can host your own matches, which eliminates the wait if you have friends to join you, but custom games sadly don’t provide a lot of options to choose from. Single and multiplayer both unfold through a season of scheduled sport events, as you try to win games and build a following of big name sponsors and ravenous fans. It’s an apt format for Rigs that benefits greatly from its first person presentation since you feel like the superstar at the center of it all. Completing challenges rewards you with standard run-of-the-mill currency to buy new mechs, which helped keep me playing.  Each of the four mech classes has a unique feel There’s a decent amount of variety in these battlebots, and I enjoyed experimenting with and buying more advanced Rigs. Each of the four mech classes has a unique feel on the playing field along with unique stats that make them more resistant to damage or faster in combat. As you clear requirements to unlock more Rigs to use, you can start to sample their unique abilities, like the Mirage’s double jump, or the Tempest’s hover. Each mech can quickly switch into one of three power modes by using the face buttons on the controller: one built for powerful shots, another built to quickly get you around the map, and one that can repair your battle damaged bot. Combined with four maps full of multiple elevation points for vertical combat, lots of cover, and neat pathways specifically made for smaller mechs to escape dominating foes, and you have a cool playground that feels different depending on the mech you bring in. Rigs does an impressive job of conveying a sense of scale and the mech sounds are cool, but the realistic art direction doesn’t look great in VR. The arenas, characters, and rival mechs look blurry due to PSVR’s resolution limitations (especially if you inspect them closely during pre-match cutscenes, which I couldn’t help but do). The rough graphics only look worse due to some stiff mech and character animations. I couldn’t help but find myself constantly distracted by these flaws, which left me wishing this world just looked better. Rigs: Mechanized Combat League brings fast, intense multiplayer action to the PlayStation VR, but with a few notable caveats. While there was enough variety in the mechs to keep me playing through a full season of matches, the sub-par visuals distract, and big matchmaking issues made online wait times unbearable. It’s fun to play with friends, but try to take it for a spin before committing, if only to make sure your stomach can actually handle it.
Brendan Graeber	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	 There’s something for every Dark Souls 3 fan to enjoy in Ashes of Ariandel, the first of two planned DLC packs. There’s a brand-new icy land to explore, new weapons, armor, and spells of almost every type that are sure to please no matter what skills your character favors. Exactly how long that enjoyment lasts, however, may depend on whether you enjoy fighting players over bosses. In this expansion, you will journey to a land quite familiar to and yet altogether different from the Painted World of Ariamis of Dark Souls 1. Despite being able to access the new area early on, don’t expect this new Painted World of Ariandel to pull any punches, even if you’ve already beaten the final boss of Dark Souls 3. Enemies here are both diverse and deadly, and able to deal incredible damage. More than ever, learning their attack patterns quickly is key to survival. The Millwood Knights – hulking, Viking-inspired men who wander the forests – are able to explode the ground around you with their unique weapons, and they hit like trucks. On the other hand, the wolves of Ariandel may not look imposing, but their ability to rally huge packs to their location with a howl will have you quickly beset on all sides.   The Painted World itself can be just as deadly, with treacherous mountain cliffs and false snowbanks that crumble underneath you that can lead to perilous situations. Ariandel holds a surprising diverse range of settings, which is a bit bittersweet considering how fast you’ll move through them. Whether battling up a snowy forest full of hunters, descending a deadly drop of large twisted roots, or exploring a rotting settlement full of disturbingly sickly occupants, I was continually impressed by each new area and wished they could have been larger. They’re more like teases than satisfying parts of the world. To make matters worse, Ariandel seems to continue Dark Souls 3’s tradition of an over-abundance of bonfires that made these bite-sized places feel even quicker – I never had to worry about retreading my steps. At one point I even found bonfires on both sides of a bridge, with no enemies anywhere near either side. When you add shortcuts to the mix, Ariandel becomes relatively tame when you don’t have to push as far to make progress. Expect to spend about five to ten hours depending on your skill and whether or not you stop to explore and smell the rotting roses.   I was continually impressed by each new area and wished they could have been larger.  The bosses of Ariandel are formidable in their own right and provide some unexpected twists, although I felt that both the main and the optional boss relied on somewhat similar tactics. Despite that, I found a good amount of challenge from both enemies because they forced me to change up tactics when things weren’t going my way. While I felt like the final boss turned into more of an endurance test, I was still happy with the outcome once I learned to deal with each of the threats I came up against. I also found it particularly pleasing that, in keeping with the Dark Souls spirit of fighting to earn your prizes, you won’t be able to engage in the PvP arenas until defeating the optional boss.   For those who enjoy the rigors of mortal combat, the new arena in Ashes of Ariandel will provide even more content. There’s a robust amount of options and modifiers you can control - things like setting up anywhere from two to six players in either team battles or messy free-for-alls, as well as toggling the optional ability to heal. The arena itself holds just the slightest bit of cover and vantage points, forcing conflict while still allowing ranged fighters to seek alternative avenues. I was also happy to see that there was anti-spawn-camping feature in effect, blasting back opponents seeking to strike before you were ready to fight. The Painted World of Ariandel presents a land that’s both enticing and dangerous, and there’s plenty of challenges to face even if you won’t have to face them too many times. However, unless you really love dueling in PvP arenas and can find sustained interest there, this adventure may serve as more of an appetizer than a full course meal.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/100ft-robot-golf-review	 Problems number one and two are that 100ft Robot Golf is neither a good golf game nor a good giant-robot game. Problem number three is that its PlayStation VR mode actually makes it worse. Throw in bad graphics, limited gameplay options, and an attempt at cheesy humor that forgets the humor part and you’ve got one of PSVR’s more forgettable games. To its credit, 100ft Robot Golf takes its clever premise – an anime-style far future where the once-popular sport of giant robot golf is making a televised comeback – and attempts to build a full-blown 2 to 3-hour campaign around it, complete with a fleshed-out storyline and a large cast of characters. It’s all told through badly dubbed anime-style cutscenes, but the cheese is intentional and delivered by a voice cast of amateur actors that includes game developers and podcasters.  It just isn’t that funny. Sure, some of the anime references might elicit a chuckle, and I give it props for getting a grin out of me when it unveiled a Voltron-like 100ft robot piloted by five Corgis, but most of it is borderline unwatchable. That the on-course commentary is highly repetitive doesn’t help either. The news doesn’t get much better when your 100ft robot actually steps up to the tee box. I’m fine with not having many shot options in an arcadey golf game – for instance, you can’t club up or down – but I often had shots land in what were essentially no-win situations, leaving me frustrated at having my ball go nowhere and thus having to swing again from the same spot.  What depth and variety there is comes from each 100ft robot having its own simplistic swing meter and special ability, such as an extra-bouncy ball or a hoverboard that lets you more quickly traverse the course in order to get your ball in the hole faster. All of bots can melee-attack buildings to literally clear a path for shots to fly through, which adds a fun wrinkle. 100ft Robot Golf is at its best when speed-golf rounds pop up, in which whoever puts their ball in the hole first wins the most points. When it’s a standard turn-by-turn match it’s just a dull golf game, but here you’re able to physically interfere with your opponents’ shots by simply getting your giant self in the path of your foe’s ball.  The challenges you unlock when you finish the campaign, such as the one where you control four golfers simultaneously in a four-way split-screen and have to get their balls in the hole (it’s much harder than it sounds) are the best designed elements here. If only more (or really any) of that had been worked into the campaign proper... Meanwhile, graphics are never king, but when a game gives you the option of putting on a VR headset that drops you inside its world, it’d better look halfway decent. 100ft Robot Golf’s PS2-era graphics won’t impress you on a regular TV, and immersing yourself in them with PSVR only amplifies their crudeness. You’re set inside the ‘bot’s head by default in VR, but the perspective neither helped my golf game nor made me feel like an awesome giant robot. It’s more of a distraction than anything else. Also, for some inexplicable reason multiplayer is incompatible with PSVR mode. 100ft Robot Golf is a game whose title paints a much prettier mental image than what’s actually delivered. The very basic golf gameplay is full of frustrating moments without high points to balance them out, the graphics are rudimentary without stylistic charm, and the jokes in the goofy story and commentary don’t land often enough to save it. And if you’re going to play it I’d suggest staying away from the VR mode – it only makes things tougher and uglier.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	 Unlike a lot of VR projects at this early stage for the technology, Driveclub VR is a proper, full-fat game. It’s not a low calorie, 25-minute “experience”, or a glorified tech demo; it’s a content-rich racer packed with plenty of courses and cars, and hours and hours of solo and multiplayer racing. Unfortunately the trip from standard screens to PSVR has stripped Driveclub of most of what it does best – notably its cutting-edge visuals and weather effects – and the vast bulk of its content already exists in the 2014 original. I firmly believe VR is an incredible way to play racing games, but it’s not really the best way to play Driveclub.  Driveclub VR’s first big sin is its surprising separation from the original Driveclub. While it recycles from the standard version of Driveclub heavily, even cribbing its intro vignette, everyone starts from scratch in Driveclub VR. Driveclub VR seems to dole out cars quicker as you level up but they’re still mostly locked from use from the outset, regardless of how far you’ve progressed in the original. This means plenty of unnecessary slogging for Driveclub veterans. My patience definitely grew thin treading over such similar ground, especially with the drift events which (despite how admirably and significantly Driveclub improved following its botched release) still favour speed over style, and still suffer for it.  At its best, Driveclub VR looks far, far better than I’d ever anticipated. The biggest problem, however, is visual fidelity. At its best, Driveclub VR looks far, far better than I’d ever anticipated. There’s an overall softness to the image, like you’re wearing someone else’s glasses and everything’s a fraction out of focus, but the detail achieved in the cabins here is still immense. The way different surfaces absorb and reflect light, from matte-finished dashboards to the glint of polished carbon fibre. The way the beating sun even picks up the scuffs on the windscreen from the wipers is a particularly nice touch that’s survived the transition. I do really feel seated in a virtual car (a slightly blurry but very authentic virtual car). At its worst, however, it’s an absolute eyesore. Anything beyond 40-or-so metres ahead of you begins to turn into a low-res globule, which makes it a massive strain to concentrate on upcoming corners, or even look through apexes. I can play sessions of Project CARS in VR on PC that last hours, but I can’t tolerate Driveclub VR for anywhere near the same amount of time. This hardware disparity is completely expected, I know, but it remains exhausting squinting at coloured blobs. It’s all well and good being able to turn and see the meticulously-modelled monster V12 mounted behind your seat, but 98% of the time in a racing game you need have your eyes set on the road in front, as far ahead as feasible, and that happens to be where Driveclub VR is at its ugliest. Don't be fooled by these screenshots; they're not representative of PSVR. I also found myself completely rejecting the artificial, forced perspective shifts – these keep your view tilted forwards for just a moment anytime the road begins to rise (or flatten after a descent) and the car’s nose pitches up (the effect is reversed when you suddenly dip downhill). It’s subtle, and I didn’t exactly lose my lunch over it, but there’s something definitely off about it. It’s a mistake of Driveclub VR to simulate any head movement. The player’s head position and view should always remain relative to the car; if our actual heads aren’t moving, our heads in-game shouldn’t be either.  Once the novelty factor subsides there aren’t many reasons to stick with it over the standard version. All this is a real shame because, as I said, VR is an absolutely terrific way to play racing games. Combined with a wheel it’s arguably the best way. Once you’ve experienced the ability to see out of the cabin in (almost) any direction, meaningfully use your mirrors at a glance, and look all the way through a corner to the exit it can actually be quite hard to go back to a flat screen. I love the sense of scale of VR; when not restricted to the dimensions of your TV screen cars have real presence and racing environments stretch out all around you. Driveclub VR’s panoramic vistas are actually especially good as making me feel very, very small. There is definitely a certain grandeur to it when you’re high up on a hillside, looking out and across at the ribbon of asphalt snaking over the countryside below that forms the rest of the course. The list of sacrifices, however, is just a bit too great. Once the novelty factor subsides there aren’t many reasons to stick with it over the standard version, with the latter’s drastically better graphics, class-leading weather effects, and increased amount of opponents on track. The only real content Driveclub VR adds is a few new courses, and they’re coming to the original game in a free update anyway. Driveclub VR is Sony’s VR racing welcome wagon and, in small doses, I think it does its job of demonstrating the potential of VR racing. The racing genre is perfect for seated VR, and Driveclub VR delivers a functional example of that experience. Unfortunately, that’s really about all it delivers. Beyond that it’s just a pre-existing game with fewer features and graphics that make me feel like I have the vision of a 95-year-old man.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	 EVE Valkyrie is a great example of how a traditional game genre can be made much better when it’s designed to be played in virtual reality. And I’m not just talking about immersion. I’m talking about being able to turn your head to track an enemy ship as it zips overhead and aim a weapon with your face. It’s a whole new level of dogfighting, and it makes Valkyrie’s grindy progression worth sitting through. When you join the multiplayer queue you’ll cycle through standard team-deathmatch furballs and two point-capture modes. They’re all good – eight-on-eight space battles are usually thrilling, look great, and the mechanics are simple enough to pick up and enjoy very quickly. But the most exciting one is Carrier Assault, where you knock down the enemy flagship’s shields by capturing points and then attack it directly. This two-phase objective created some of the best battle moments I’ve had, between dodging enemy fire as I strafe their capital ship’s weak points and picking off attackers who’re too focused on attacking my carrier to notice I’m right behind them and have them in my sights.  This is a team-based game, but less because of needing to strike a balance between fighter, heavy fighter, and support-class ships on a team and more because getting caught without a wingman by two or more enemies means almost certain death. Plus, the arcadey physics won’t let you pull Battlestar Galactica-style maneuvers that use Newtonian inertia, so one-on-one dogfights tend to devolve into a dull dance of circling each other endlessly, using a combination of engine boosts and brakes to try to line up a shot. Valkyrie is at its best when you spot a teammate in trouble and swoop in to pick off the bogey on his tail, or vice versa, and giving the obligatory Han Solo “Wahoo!”  Valkyrie is at its best when you spot a teammate in trouble and swoop in. Given that, it’s a little strange that you have to manually group up into a squadron before Valkyrie will let you do any voice communication with your allies, and that can only be done between matches. Since everybody playing Valkyrie has a mic and headphones, you’d think they’d be more open with the coms. Flying heavy fighters and support ships is dramatically different from the standard fighter – it’s much more than simple armor and speed redistribution. I’ll require a lot more practice before I learn how to handle them as well as the straightforward fighter, which shreds targets with machine gun-style forward-facing guns and weak homing missiles that lock onto targets independently based on what you’re looking at. By contrast, the heavy fighters I’ve unlocked have an eye-targeted flak cannon as their main weapon, allowing you to spray fast-moving, lightly armored enemies with a steady stream of minor damage as long as you can keep them in view. (I’m still having problems crashing into things on the busier space station maps because I’m not watching where I’m going while I’m chasing a target.) And instead of a secondary weapon it has a short-range warp drive that can be used to quickly reach a capture point or escape danger when your thick shields and armor have absorbed as much punishment as they can take. Early support ships have a weak but auto-hit lock-on beam that drains shields, and some can drop extremely helpful robot mines that latch onto any ship that passes nearby to heal allies or damage enemies. (I’m not much of a support pilot at this point, but if you’re dropping repair bots I’ll cover you at every opportunity.)  Progression through the unlocks is frustratingly slow. There are a lot of ship varieties to unlock, each with different stats and different weapon loadouts, so there’s lots of interesting combat potential. The problem is that progression through the unlocks is frustratingly slow. That’s even using “implants” that boost your XP gain temporarily, which can be purchased with earned in-game currency or with real money. The whole process feels like something out of a grindy free-to-play game, presumably trying to squeeze some microtransaction cash out of all the Oculus Rift pre-order customers who got Valkyrie for free with their headsets, which made up the majority of players until the PlayStation VR came along. It’s annoying, because even though most unlockable ships seem to be simply redistributing the same number of points through their stat values, I find increased firepower to be a huge advantage. The ability to knock out an opponent quickly by taking them by surprise before they can evade racks up kills faster than anything else. So when someone has a hard-hitting ship unlocked you really see it in the after-action numbers. For a $60 game with microtransactions, feeling outgunned by people who pay more to progress faster doesn’t sit very well. See all our PlayStation VR launch game reviews. There is some single-player content (on top of playing regular matches against AI bots), but other than the challenging wave-based survival mode, which is a great way to learn the abilities and limitations of a newly unlocked ship, the appeal wears off quickly. What passes for campaign missions are so quick and easy they’re barely there at all, and the enemy ships are so weak they might be made of tinfoil. There’s also a “scout” mode where you search uninhabited maps for hidden items to reveal extra bits of lore, which couldn’t be less exciting. Not knowing anything about EVE Online’s lore the story of cloned pilots signing up as mercenaries didn’t do much for me, though the voice acting isn’t bad. Progression and microtransaction problems aside, after a VR stint in EVE Valkyrie I don’t think I’ll ever be able to go back to playing a dogfighting game on a regular screen. It’s just too good at showing me what I’ve been missing by not being able to look around freely as I pursue or evade targets. The intense and movie-like moments of strafing an enemy carrier while dodging incoming fire are a thrill.
Kallie Plagge	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	 The prospect of psychological horror in VR was enough to make me nervous, and Here They Lie did succeed in scaring me at the very beginning. As I trudged through its twisted, nightmarish world, though, that fear soon gave way to unintimidating stealth gameplay and sudden bouts of nausea. It has some solidly spooky concepts to work with, but Here They Lie tries too hard and overstays its welcome as a result. There’s something truly terrifying about not having any idea where you are or what you’re doing there and not even being able to trust your own eyes. In Here They Lie, part of the horror comes from not knowing if the world is messed up, or if it’s just you. The starting area was the scariest for me because everything was so mysterious — as I moved through a train, shadowy figures appeared before me and then vanished. Showing the threat but not actually sending anything my way as I wandered (with smooth movement using the gamepad) through an unfamiliar, labyrinthine subway station was enough to make me tense up quite a bit.   It was a pretty good start that kept me on my toes — I never knew if I was imagining it or if there really was death just over my shoulder. Playing with the PlayStation VR added to that tension, at least for a while. I felt like I needed to check over my shoulder constantly for someone or something behind me, and the fact that I was looking around with my actual head made that unsettling feeling more intense. Once I exited the station and started walking through a dilapidated city, that feeling slowly started to dissipate and returned only sporadically.  Enemies are little more than props for haunted house-style jump scares.  With the introduction of the city, Here They Lie also revealed its first enemies, and that’s when it started to slip. Instead of simply walking through a haunting urban landscape, I had to stealthily slip past grotesque monsters (since there’s no combat). While their growls and cries are appropriately inhuman, that alone isn’t enough to make them scary — for most of Here They Lie, they’re just an obstacle to sneak past, rather than a predatory threat. Death isn’t at all punishing and actually put me ahead of where I’d been in a few cases. Monsters don’t even react to the telltale beam of your flashlight. They’re little more than props for kids’ haunted house-style jump scares (like when skeletons fall toward you in a carnival ride).  See all our PlayStation VR Launch Game Reviews For a moment, Here They Lie starts to break away from its predictable horror formula and becomes really surreal. Hallways bend — which is not at all fun in VR — and it loses its grip on reality even more. But it tries really hard to be edgy and creepy, so much so that it’s off-putting. Grunting people with animal masks over their heads gyrate to techno in a red building in one scene, and the hidden notes I found in the area discussed an unnamed woman’s kinks. It feels like Here They Lie is working far too hard to be provocative and trippy horror but doesn’t know what it’s trying to say or even what it’s talking about, like a kid swearing for the first time.  It tries too hard to be provocative, like a kid swearing for the first time.  It continues on like that for way too long, spacing out the parts that are legitimately unsettling and leaving stretches of boredom between them. I did lose some sense of how long I was playing (probably four or so hours total), though, since certain cutscenes’ camera movements were horribly nauseating, forcing me to take frequent breaks. That, combined with pointless Dali-esque surrealism, made playing feel like a chore. Though it has a few unsettling, adrenaline-pumping moments, Here They Lie fails to deliver believable psychological horror. It definitely tries — it’s filled with the requisite creepy, gargling monster sounds and reality-bending that can contribute tension to scares — but it doesn’t blend its horror elements well enough to be consistently terrifying. Relying so heavily on overwrought surrealism and a few haunted house-style jumps to create tension rather than fostering any true discomfort (besides nausea) leaves it feeling flat.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	 When you tell someone that virtual reality will let them experience exotic and wildly imaginative things as though they were really there, they probably won’t fantasize about being placed in spartan environments and told to stack blocks on top of each other as high as they can. Yet that’s the approach Tumble VR has taken in making use of the PlayStation VR, so even though there are some decent head-scratcher puzzles in this collection it’s hard to get excited about the mundane premise. The more than 30 puzzles alternate through several variations on the theme. There’s the ridiculously simple and easy stacking of blocks on top of each other to reach a given height, some dizzyingly complex light-reflection puzzles where blocks with mirrors must be used to redirect a laser through multi-colored objectives, the sometimes-frustrating job of stacking as many blocks as you can onto a platform as a bar moves back and forth to knock off anything over a certain height, a random-feeling one where you plant of bombs to knock over a stack of blocks, and building bridges between pillars. There are variations on those ideas, too, and some of the solutions made me feel clever for figuring them out after a few minutes of experimentation. There are many different materials, too, and each has weight and friction properties that have to be accounted for. There’s some depth to it.  Yet there are a few limitations – some by design and some a result of the PlayStation VR – that constantly rubbed me the wrong way as I fiddled with the blocks. For instance, even with two Move controllers you can only use one hand and only manipulate one block at a time, which limits your options. You can’t for instance, brace two blocks against each other – which would be very handy in the bridge-building puzzle type. That’s obviously the way it’s intended, because puzzles are built with that restriction in mind, but having these seemingly physical items in front of me and not being able to interact with them the way I would in the real world is irritating.  PlayStation VR’s motion tracking is usually precise enough. Next up, the PlayStation VR’s motion tracking is usually precise enough to place a block right where you want it, and you can flip a block around 90 degrees in any direction as you hold it with the right stick to get it into the correct orientation to fit where you need it to go. But this is a good demonstration of where the tracking isn’t always pinpoint accurate, since when your controller flickers around slightly it’s very noticeable. I also hit the borders of the small trackable area a lot because Tumble VR likes to make you want to reach up, down, and to the sides to grab and place blocks. You can generally move a puzzle around using the left stick in order to keep it in your tracking area, and some (like the stacking puzzles) move automatically, but you have to fight your natural impulse to try to grab something that looks to be within an arm’s reach. Also, because you can’t pick up one block and use it to nudge another (there’s no impact effect until you release the block you’re holding), arranging Tetris-style blocks into place is extremely tough to do unless you line them up absolutely perfectly - the blocks that are already placed won’t move at all to accommodate the new one you’re trying to slide in. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. The only splash of personality added to Tumble VR comes from the cliche floating robot eye that makes sardonic, GlaDOS-style quips about the purpose of the tests you’re doing, as has become all but standard in physics puzzle games. Isn’t there some other kind of delivery we could try? At the end of the day, we’re mostly just stacking blocks in Tumble VR, and that’s rarely going to be exciting. Even when it challenged me with head-scratching feats of structural engineering it bored me with the mundanity of its theme. Adding onto that some of the PlayStation VR’s inherent limitations with tracking, and it was as often frustrating as rewarding.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	 Despite being a 14-year-old game retrofitted to work on the PlayStation VR, Rez Infinite feels like it was meant to be in virtual reality all along. Its pulsing geometric landscapes and buzzing electronic beats already felt as if they were somehow all around me, and now that they literally are, Rez has transformed into the absorptive experience it always aspired to be. Whether you’re playing in VR or the old fashioned way, Rez’s hypnotic brand of rhythm-based rail shooting is visually striking, and surprisingly deep despite its relatively simple gameplay. Playing simply to survive requires you to learn enemy weak points to take them down quickly, and above all else, properly prioritizing targets to prevent problems before they happen.  Interestingly, things flip around when you play for score. Rather than taking things out as soon as they come into view, you need to find opportunities to wait as long as possible so you can down enemies simultaneously in large groups. Played this way, Rez reveals a subtle science to how the seemingly straightforward enemy formations are laid out. Boss fights are the ultimate expression of this idea, inviting you to methodically dismantle them piece by piece, milking the clock as long as you can to build as many combos as possible before finishing them off. The head tracking is as far beyond a gamepad as a mouse and keyboard is.  In VR, using head tracking to aim is amazingly intuitive, to the point that it trumps the conventional controls in terms of speed and precision. The default VR setting abstracts things a bit for people who aren’t used to rapid movements in VR, but switch it to dynamic mode and the head tracking is as far beyond a gamepad as a mouse and keyboard is. Area X is the only all-new piece of content in Rez Infinite, as all the rest of the modes and unlocks were part of the HD re-release eight years ago. It’s a very different kind of experience, with the ability to fly freely throughout a 3D space. While beautiful on its own, VR elevates this experience dramatically, creating the sensation of flying through a vibrant fireworks display. With a nice pair of headphones on, the sumptuous soundtrack combines with the continuous onslaught of iridescent spectacle to entrance me, even after multiple playthroughs. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. Even if you don’t have a PSVR, Rez Infinite is still the most complete version of an imaginative cult classic with deceptively nuanced gameplay. But if you do, it’s also an impressive glimpse into the transportive power of virtual reality.
Jonathon Dornbush	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	 Just under a year after first wowed us on Xbox One and PC, Rise of the Tomb Raider comes to PlayStation 4, beefed up with all of its existing DLC and a few new pieces of content, including a cool VR add-on. Rise of the Tomb Raider: 20 Year Celebration on PS4 is absolutely worth picking up if you haven’t played through Lara Croft’s latest adventure yet. IGN gave Rise of the Tomb Raider a 9.3, and said this of the sequel to the 2013 reboot: “Rise of the Tomb Raider raises the bar set by Lara’s last outing with a rollicking adventure story, strong villains, gorgeous vistas, and smart puzzles – go off the main path to find the best stuff in dastardly optional tombs. Though the mandatory combat doesn’t distinguish itself with challenging enemies unless you crank up the difficulty, Lara’s newfound versatility on the battlefield makes fighting a lot more fun. Once again it’s Lara herself, however, who steals the show, her complex ambitions and hardened resolve showing new sides to a character who has well and truly grown from survivor to the most fascinating action hero in video games today.”   That score and that sentiment still rings true a year later. Crystal Dynamics’ sequel ups the ante and remains a packed, enthralling adventure, one that smartly increases the emphasis on puzzle solving and exploration while also continuing to build on the strong character work done in the original 2013 reboot. Check out our full Rise of the Tomb Raider review from last year to see more. On top of the Cold Darkness Awakened and Baba Yaga: The Temple of the Witch DLC expansions, 20 Year Celebration also adds a short new story-focused chapter: Blood Ties. (It’s available as DLC for Xbox One and PC owners, and included in the season pass.) Split into two parts, the first half is an exploratory search through Croft Manor in which Lara is trying to uncover the secrets of her parents and the estate’s past to save it. There’s no combat or treacherous caverns to navigate, but I appreciated the stripped down, quiet character study.  There's no combat in Blood Ties, but I appreciated the quiet character study. Building on the work already done to flesh out Lara’s character in the main game, Blood Ties delivers further details and backstory to her life pre-Tomb Raider and the Croft family as a whole. What’s learned through environmental discoveries, like information about the relationship between Lara’s parents through diary entries and audio recordings, may not change the way I looked at the main story, but it further recontextualized and smartly deepened my understanding of Lara. Croft Manor, despite its years of wear, is a gorgeous location to explore in first or third-person perspective. The way most players will likely experience it, in third-person, is certainly an intriguing opportunity for someone already invested in this reboot series’ take on Lara. Experiencing it in first-person with PlayStation VR, however, can be an even more impressively immersive affair — when it’s not nauseating, that is.   Blood Ties’ VR component has two control options: Comfort and Free modes. Played in Comfort Mode the VR experience is, as its name suggests, pretty comfortable and easy to learn. You point the controller to a spot in the environment, push a couple of buttons, and Lara teleports around. Getting to take in the beautiful architectural detail of Croft manor from Lara’s viewpoint makes up for a lack of one-to-one mobility.  Blood Ties can be impressively immersive in VR — when it's not nauseating. The Free control scheme, however, made me and several other IGN staffers ill within minutes of using it, and kept us sick for hours afterwards. Lara’s movement is so smooth and slow that the strong disconnect between what my seated body was doing and in-game self was doing caused instant queasiness. That said, before the nausea set in I was incredibly impressed by what it felt like to walk around Croft Manor. It’s worth giving a go to see whether the experience affects you in the same way, but approach with caution – if you start feeling queasy bail out quick, or you’ll risk the kind of day-long head and stomach ache I had.. We also get Lara’s Nightmare, in which the manor is infested with nightmarish demons. This replayable mode offers a few fun challenges to chase, and is a smart way to reuse a well-constructed environment. But, while fun, combat was never Rise’s most impressive aspect and it can lose its luster here quickly enough.   20 Year Celebration also throws in an online cooperative version of the Endurance DLC, which was already one of the more fun additions to the originally released Rise of The Tomb Raider. Endurance proves to be even more enjoyable with another survivor on hand to fight through the wilderness with you. Co-op adds the interesting twist of allowing both players to extract themselves and their rewards from the situation before their partner, adding even more tension to what can already be a fraught yet exciting mode. Rise of the Tomb Raider hasn’t lost its luster a year after its initial release. Bundled together with all of the content released so far, Lara’s already-packed adventure is now even bigger. And while Playing the new non-combat story mode, Blood Ties, with PlayStation VR was enjoyable (when I was in Comfort Mode, at least), and played normally it’s an interesting character study. The co-op enabled Endurance mode is also a new highlight.. For PS4 players just getting their first opportunity to play Rise of the Tomb Raider, 20 Year Celebration is a complete and amazing package.
Rob Smith	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	 Like so many before it, the Dragon Quest series has taken a detour into the realm of Minecraft-style collecting and crafting – no points are given if you predicted that turn of events. Mucho points, however, if you called that it would execute the premise so seamlessly, and embrace its own signature traits while delivering a single-player RPG adventure that alludes to the Dragon Quest classics. To be clear, unlike Minecraft and others in the building and crafting frame, this is a solo pursuit not a social enterprise. Ready to make a mark with my lightly personalized character I was immediately shocked to be told that I was not – repeat NOT – a hero. But the gameplay informed me differently, because right out of the gate the NPCs in this simplistic RPG tale knew I was special and treated me accordingly. Tragically, it wasn’t until way past character creation did I discover I was known to them as the “Builder” because I desperately wanted to go back and rename myself Bob.  Building or, more specifically, creating, is your unique talent in a world where people have been stripped of the fundamentals of creation. They literally don’t know how anymore. It’s a strange but convenient conceit to hand you the keys to leadership through your ability to architect a town and manage conflicting functions, but most crucially protect a small but steadily growing population reemerging from their background-story wilderness. Some characters need rescuing, others come to visit, enthralled by your abilities that had inexplicably been lost to the world in some conflict possibly stemming from the Dragonlord.  As Minecraft has taught an entire generation to expect, it’s pretty much all destructible. Flaunting Dragon Quest’s endearing signature style, the graphics in Builders represent a world crafted in vibrant cubes. And as Minecraft has taught an entire generation to expect, it’s pretty much all destructible using your tools as you mine the earth itself (used to erect room walls in your slowly growing town), and eventually coal, copper, and iron that allow the construction of more advanced weapons, armor, tools, and artefacts for your townspeople. It also means that almost anywhere is accessible. Don’t fancy walking around the base of the mountain and risk drowning in the drink? You could, with patience, hack your way through.  While mining resources and collecting plants and metals alongside an occasional flurry of combat is all- too familiar, the pace and dexterity of progression is initially refreshing and, crucially, keenly aware of itself. It reveals your abilities in this world quickly, but without overbearing you with process. Given that it involves building a town from ruins, scavenging for a wide variety of useful resources, and fighting both fauna and the geography of this cubed world, it’s an impressive balance.  Builders tiptoes across the chasm between “kids game” and “adult friendly.” The fundamental processes don’t sway from crafting RPG norms: you build from rags to leather to iron to steel. But the ultimate bad guy isn’t so clear, and that’s evidence of how Builders tiptoes across the chasm between “kids game” and “adult friendly.” While most of the dialogue is by-the-fantasy-book, it’s also peppered with occasional notes that remind you it was written by a real person in the 21st century. A personal favorite: “You want to take a look at my tool…we only just met.” I know, I know – but in this context it was refreshing. All the dialogue is snappy, so while conversations can grind on, quickly clicking through them gets you to the point at your own pace.  So you harvest the resources of the land and parlay that into the ability to build machinery or functions around your town that encourage growth. By growth, it really means from a couple of people to a handful – barely a village – but the purpose is clear and persuasive. These guys and gals will even pitch in to help while you’re off fighting the good fight. Once they have a campfire for cooking they will fill a chest with the food they make so you can snag it whenever you want. I appreciated the thoughtful assistance (and the fact I didn’t have to micromanage absolutely every element, since you do have to manage your hunger as well as your health while out in the wilderness).  It never bogs down in overcomplicated combat mechanics. Of course, you can’t get away from the chopping, hacking, mining of metals, or even the slaughter of aggressive scorpions or passive Dragon Quest blobs. They all present challenges in their own right and though it takes some time before Builders flexes its muscles into pushing you to make more cerebral considerations, the focus is always clear. It never bogs down in overcomplicated combat mechanics, though there is a subtle art to the attack-and-retreat mechanisms against some of the bigger critters. A simple upgrade to a charged spin attack (that can also be used effectively to harvest resources a little quicker in some areas) is about as complex as it becomes. When random skeletons attack your fledgling town, knock down walls, and undo your careful deliberations it’s a shame, but you’re not overly punished, and that’s so much to Builders’ credit. Sure, you have to spend time rebuilding, but the door, armoire, or furnace is still there to be picked up and replaced instead of needing to be recrafted. It’s also refreshing to see your townsfolk pitch in here, too, joining in the fight and offering their own defense. Since the town is where you need to sleep—because staying out when the lights go down at night is dangerous due to an increase in wandering creatures—it pays to keep it well stocked with beds. Similarly, Builders doesn’t punish you for dying, for failing, or for taking your time. Though the rewards for completing the soft “quests” are almost worthless, the point is that you will be scavenging for yourself through the portals you discover that provide instant access to new islands. But when you win the battles, be it via building structures according to a provided blueprint or from your own defenses, the people still demand more. Never, though, are their suggestions pure busywork. They all have a purpose in progressing at a steady pace towards a satisfying conclusion. Well balanced and well presented, I can’t get over the fact that Dragon Quest Builders is pure, playable, RPG-lite fun. Dragon Quest Builders is totally, thoroughly engaging. Its gameplay is accessible to kids while its dialogue offers enough sly references to keep Dad or Mom amused. Collecting, crafting, and building all sounds familiar, but this package encapsulates so much of the best parts of this creative process and wraps it in light roleplaying progression and storytelling. It doesn’t matter that there isn’t a multiplayer component, because it wouldn’t have contributed to the world. So that means this is a gold-standard RPG for the non-connected gamer to flex all their cerebral muscles wherever they want it to go.
Rob Smith	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	 It’s hard to imagine how the conversation went at the initial pitch meeting for The Tomorrow Children: “It’s a dystopian world where a girl—well, a clone—and her friends chop up resources, rescue Russian dolls, and rebuild the populations and towns overseen by a creepy overlord. Oh, and it’s got a distinct ‘50s Russian propaganda visual style. And it’ll be free to play soon, but right now you have to buy in.” Well, on the one hand you can see the inherent intrigue of the unique premise, but on the other that’s going to take some ‘splainin’. And that happens to be the first place where Q-Games’ (best known for the PixelJunk series) The Tomorrow Children falls down. This game of resource collection, town building, and, in fact, social engineering throws many resources, tickets, and currencies at you very quickly, but doesn’t provide an awful lot of explaining of their value or significance.   Out of the gate you’re introduced to the beleaguered land called Void; its current state of emerging from some apocalyptic event is explained through Russian-style TV commercials reminiscent of 1984’s brooding, omnipresent face. And you? You’re a kind of Elizabeth from BioShock meets Russian wooden doll who is quickly handed a pickaxe and directed to collect resources. But the immediate Minecraft similarity gives way to a much more stylized experience as you’re introduced to your first town and armed with a walkie-talkie from which you’ll receive instructions and a rocket launcher with which to handle indigenous pests. The control mechanics for basic functions are simple enough to pick up but it is easy to be confused by the form and function of the currencies and resources you must now collect. Handily, should you dilly-dally you are prompted with a suggestion of where to head. It can then be a head-scratcher to figure out which building you’re looking for specifically though because of all of the buildings share the same style, so it’s awkward to instantly recognize a Ministry of Labor from a worker’s house. Yet it is fascinating to explore and simply take in the unique architecture, its foggy brown sheen and subdued colors making for a truly original style.  As you explore this world you begin to understand its usually poorly explained rules. Once the initial exploration of the starting island is finished it’s time to get to work, and there is plenty of work for these tomorrow children. Very quickly jumping on a train that travels between different towns, you start to explore this world and begin to understand its usually poorly explained rules. Rules like how you can drown in the Void with one misstep; like discovering the tool I had taken to one island would not mine its resources, and then seeing the island slowly dissolve out of existence, leading to a frustrating death and restart; like being chased by the indigenous Izverg creatures for no apparent reason; like placing the Russian dolls—vital to growing your town’s population—on the glowing red pods to turn them into real proletariat; like collecting resources, stacking them on the cargo portion of the train, and dropping them at the loading bay back at your chosen town where you—or friends—could deposit them to pursue growth opportunities.   The trial and error and learning does have its initial charms until the process becomes increasingly repetitive. And it would be painfully repetitive if not for the revelation that a significant , but not yet fully realized social aspect exists at the heart of the story and, indeed, its overriding philosophy.  You’re not just working for yourself, you’re truly for the betterment and rebuilding of society itself. It’s easy to wonder in the early game why you—this “projection clone”, a non-person—could possibly want to engage in the world-building busywork at the behest of a seemingly tyrannical overlord. As a result, I found myself disengaged for portions of the rote nature of resource collection and adherence to the rules. Yet when a disembodied red flash of a character similar to yours appears in your town, or next to you while you’re digging and you realize it’s a real person, then it opens up a new layer of gameplay cooperation that’s all communicated through implication and actions rather than words. That means you’re not just working for yourself, you’re truly working on your towns for the betterment and rebuilding of society itself. And then you put two and two together with the Russian Marxist themes, and the battle of collective will against an oppressing enemy becomes so much more impactful. While it gives greater purpose to the “why” it doesn’t really solve the ongoing repetition of the “what.” Despite a significant library of tools to buy, the potential of upcoming microtransactions to speed your process (and simply more players in the world to populate the cooperative nature), and the variety of resources, islands to visit, outfits to unlock, currency to earn, and objects to build it fails to deliver any significant oomph moments. Even when the town you have slaved over by building houses and tools through solving puzzles at the workbench is bombarded by incoming four-story tall Izvergs, the tempo of this tower defense-lite combat doesn’t hold more attention. You have to admire where The Tomorrow Children does innovate—particularly its look and social engineering—but it overly burdens you and bogs down progression with dragging resource collection and bureaucratic manipulation. Even though you immediately progress from a Prole to the ranks of the papered Bourgeoisie you’re still tediously grinding for the man.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	 One of the greatest things about virtual reality is the way it invites you to reach out and touch objects that aren’t really there, and gives you the ability to do impossible things with them. Job Simulator is an excellent demonstration of that potential, putting you in mundane situations and letting you have cartoony fun with them. In four different colorful recreations of menial job scenarios, you’re given things to do: Eat a doughnut. Make soup. Fix a car. Ring up customers. That sort of thing. What makes doing all this stuff fun instead of actual work is that the robots who are running this recreation of human society don’t understand or don't care how you do it, as long as you follow a very literal description of the task. So there’s plenty of room for doing creative and ridiculous things, and lots of absurd tools to do them with.   The fun of Job Simulator comes from combining objects in goofy ways. Each of the jobs (office worker, gourmet chef, convenience store clerk, and automotive repairman) has its own series of tasks that’ll take at least 15 minutes to get through. They go longer if you spend some time just messing around – which you absolutely should. The fun of Job Simulator comes from combining objects in goofy ways, testing to see if the developers have thought of what might happen when you put dish soap in a smoothie in the restaurant or when you put your hand on a copy machine or throw everything you can find at a robot. It’s really impressive how many things they’ve anticipated and come up with funny reactions for your actions, and how interactive all of these environments are. Every drawer or cabinet opens, and there’s usually something fun to play with hidden there. Because Job Simulator is always encouraging us to experiment, I quickly ran into the main limitation of the PlayStation Camera that's used to track your hand movements. First, unless your camera is very well positioned, some of the cabinets and items placed below waist level can be hard to grab because they're right on the edge of the viewing range. Anything dropped on the floor automatically warps back to the table in front of you, which mercifully prevents you from having to try to reach the floor (but will sometimes create big piles that are hard to get rid of). Plus, though there's rarely anything going on behind you, trying to turn all the way around and interact with something will make your hands vanish because your body gets between them and the camera. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. The other thing that slows it down is that at the end of the day Job Simulator is effectively one joke stretched out over four different scenarios. It wears a bit thin after awhile. There’s some funny dialogue and some good gags, but not really enough to sustain it for a long play session by yourself. So this is a game that’s best played with some friends, swapping out who’s playing and having everyone else shouting suggestions from the couch. The audience gets to watch the goofiness play out on the TV as the player pantomimes the action, and that’s a good time for everybody. Job Simulator's simple tasks are made fun by its absurdist sense of humor and goofy props. It'll test the limits of the PlayStation VR's motion tracking abilities by enticing you to reach for every object and device you can see, which sometimes makes things a little frustrating. But the rewards for experimentation make it well worth doing.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	 I expected a lot better from the folks that invented Guitar Hero and Rock Band. Harmonix Music VR is a collection of four music-themed VR experiences, none of which are all that interesting or entertaining. It wouldn’t be worth five dollars, much less $25. [Editor's Note: Harmonix had confirmed the $24.99 price prior to press time, but on October 6 contacted us to say that the launch price will now in fact be $14.99.] The Easel is Harmonix Music VR’s most interesting element, probably because it lets you scratch your own creative itch. It lets you draw with the Move controllers in 3D space with dozens of tools and styles and then manipulate your creations in that same 3D space – again with everything you do bopping to the music. It’s very similar to the HTC Vive’s Tiltbrush, and it’s a trip to lean your head inside your creations, but it’s a short-lived distraction at best.  In The Dance, you can manipulate the poses and movements of goofy monsters inside a high school gym, again to the beat of the music. Eat a slice of nearby cake once you’re satisfied with your custom dance troupe and you’ll warp behind the DJ’s turntable, where you can tweak the speed of the music and shoot goofy items at your poor dancing monster slaves with a toy gun. A final bite of cake puts you into a godlike overhead view. Using the Move controllers to grab onto the dancers below and dunk them through the basketball hoop or fling them into oblivion is amusing...for a moment. It’s the closest Harmonix Music VR comes to offering actual gameplay, but there’s little replay value. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here.  I didn’t find it so much relaxing as just plain weird.  The other two modes are barely even interactive. The Beach puts you on a polygonal, low-fi island where you set your playlist – choosing from over a dozen electronica songs, including a selection from Harmonix’s own Amplitude or your own MP3s loaded off a USB drive. But instead of letting us touch the music, you can’t use the Move or the DualShock 4 to play. Instead, you just sit there, watching the equalizer on the horizon pulse to the beat. All you can do is look around, using your head as a mouse pointer to target certain items that will come alive if you lock in on them for a couple seconds. None create much of any surrounding virtual reality effect, because if you turn around to look behind you it just exits you back to the standard beach. It’s supposed to be relaxing, I think, but I found it boring. Finally, there’s The Trip, which also involves no controllers. You just sit there as you move through a kaleidoscope-y tunnel that thumps (sort of) in rhythm with your song. I didn’t find it so much relaxing as just plain weird. Sadly, even loading an MP3 of ‘90s favorite “Mr. Jones” by Counting Crows didn’t make any of these four music mini-games and passive experiences any less boring or more bearable. If my friends came over to check out my new $400 VR headset, Harmonix Music VR is the last thing I’d want to show them.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	 Did I feel like Batman when I put on the mask and played Batman: Arkham VR? Well, partly. Thanks to using the PlayStation Move controllers to interact with the environment I felt more like a detective searching for clues, but having my hands pass through other characters without them noticing left the physical side of being the Dark Knight conspicuously absent. I will keep this short, because this game is first and foremost a story and I wouldn't want to ruin its surprises – you only get one shot at experiencing it and being awed by the way it lets you experience developer Rocksteady's Arkham universe firsthand. Getting to stand face to face with characters that seem so small on a screen is a big jump – it’s a VR cliche now, but you won’t believe the difference it makes until you’re looking Oswald Cobblepot in the eye.  Likewise, even though the detective work in this roughly 90-minute story is mechanically exactly the same as what we’ve seen in Arkham City and Arkham Knight, it feels more intimate in VR. Especially when I was using the move controller to examine bodies in the morgue, running the device in my hand over them to scan for clues, it felt great – like I was getting my hands dirty.  It felt great – like I was getting my hands dirty. At the same time, all of the gameplay is very simple stuff, and much of the way you move around and interact with the world doesn't feel like a great fit for a character like Batman. What I love most about the actual Arkham games is the way Batman moves as I control him in combat and stealth. That makes me feel like a master ninja. But here, Batman teleports from place to place (which is more or less standard in VR games) but when he does move he's is just as much of a klutz as I am. And even though my hands are Batman’s hands, I didn’t get to punch anybody. The only hand-to-hand combat happens without your participation, so that’s a disappointing lack of interactivity. Using the three gadgets is fun for a couple of minutes. You get to grab the Batarangs, scanner, and grapnel gun off your utility belt and aim them and shoot or throw, just like Batman would. That’s cool until you realize they’ll only interact with very specific things in very specific ways, and the Batarangs have some crazy auto-aim that makes it all but impossible to miss as long as you're throwing it in the general direction of your target. Also, Alfred’s face is impervious to being shot repeatedly by a grapnel gun. The appeal of the gadgets runs out quickly. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. The story (which again, I will describe in only the vaguest of terms) of Arkham VR is a fun murder-mystery spinoff to experience from a real first-person perspective, even if it’s a little predictable. Be aware that the events that occur make it completely incompatible with Rocksteady’s established Arkham lore, so don’t go in expecting to fill in any missing pieces or to learn what really happened to Batman at the end. This is its own thing.  Arkham VR is mostly a one-and-done deal. Exploring the Batcave reveals a few more things to do, such as a Batarang target range, Riddler puzzles in which you reassemble fragmented statues, and browsing character profiles with holograms that appear in front of you as though they were really there. The Batcave has a few scattered references you can spot from its handful of vantage points, too. But beyond that, Arkham VR is a one-and-done deal. When I'd finished the story once, some of the most fun I had when going through a second time was fooling around in front of a mirror and making Batman look like a dancing moron. Being Batman in Akrham VR is a great way to more intimately experience Rocksteady's universe and to search for clues in this brief mystery. However, the world and characters around you are largely rigid and unresponsive to your actions, which leaves a lot on the table for a game about a character known as much for his brawn as he is for his brains.
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	 For a game with the words “rush” and “blood” in its title, this on-rails VR arcade shooter is sadly lacking in thrills. Based tangentially on characters and imagery from the 2015 interactive horror story from which it draws its name, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood fails to deliver anything new or remarkably exciting as a virtual reality experience, an arcade-style first-person shooter, or an Until Dawn spinoff. And yet, despite its relative blandness, there's something inviting about its cheesy brand of carnival-themed horror, casual arcade shooting, and gimmicky rollercoaster-based structure. While Rush of Blood is a pretty standard rail shooter, the ability to look around when you hear something creeping around behind you or see an enemy out of the corner of your eye makes the experience far more engaging in VR. Your field of play is effectively widened by the ability to quickly turn your head, so I was constantly scanning my environment — first out of caution, but eventually, when I realized Rush of Blood wasn’t going to be very scary, out of obligation. Baddies often pop into your peripheral, making it important to actively look around so you can start blasting away with your dual firearms before they get too close.  The shooting mechanics are simple and easy to grasp with either a DualShock 4 or the Move controllers, and feel just as fun and responsive with both. You always have two firearms at any given time, which you can control independent of each other with the Move controllers. Using a DualShock 4 grants you less precise control by keeping the guns locked together, but doesn’t sacrifice too much in terms of ease of use. You can still use the motion controls to point them freely, but need to make use of the analog sticks to widen or narrow the gap between. Once your target’s lined up, it’s a simple pull of the triggers to shoot, and either the DualShock’s bumpers or the Move controller’s center Move button to reload.  There's never a shortage of things to shoot. When it comes to targets, there's never a shortage of things to shoot, including inanimate filler objects to help keep your point multiplier going if you’re chasing a high score, as well as special collectibles that kept me hyper-aware of my environment at all times. One major collectible announces its presence with the distant sound of a baby wailing, and that’s one of the neat ways Rush of Blood uses sound to both build atmosphere and direct gameplay.  Optional targets range in size from large crates to small vases and other objects, all conveniently marked with bullseyes. Some of the most satisfying moments in Rush of Blood came not from shooting away at waves of enemies, but quickly one-shotting every last optional target in a room. The flashlight beams that emit from both firearms act as laser sights that, in the absence of a crosshair, make sniping especially faraway objects possible in the darkness.  None of the levels really blew my mind or subverted my expectations. New weapon pickups are frequent and often placed before areas where you’ll need them most. They’re also easy to see in large, festively colored crates that stand out against the drab greys and browns of most levels, with an easily identifiable silhouette of the weapon type on the front. Shooting a crate flings that weapon only into the hand you shot it with, so you can have fun mixing it up: I often found myself going for the short-range firepower of a shotgun in one hand while keeping one pistol for the long-range accuracy. Weapon crates always come in pairs though, so the option to trade off both handguns for alternatives, like the more powerful but ammo-limited dual revolvers or the speedy dual machine pistols, is always there. Special weapons are temporary, but it’s easy to glance down at the dashboard on your rollercoaster train to see how much ammo you have left. Once depleted, they automatically switch back to the default handguns, but that never felt like a bad thing. The starter pistols are reliable enough thanks to their infinite ammo and quick reloading to use exclusively — that is, if you can keep up with the longer waves of enemies in later levels.  Until Dawn: Rush of Blood starts out strong, especially once it hits its stride after the tutorial-heavy first level. You’re introduced to the rollercoaster structure by a circus ringleader-type played by the same actor who portrayed The Stranger in Until Dawn, but who I believe is meant to be a different character. Rush of Blood seems to take place in the mind of Josh, considering the frequent cameos from his twin sisters, so it would make sense for him to reappropriate people he’s met into new and strange roles. Not even this connection to the main game is very satisfying in terms of carrying on the Until Dawn story, though, and isn’t really necessary to enjoy the experience. Still, the invitation to take a ride on a hellbound rollercoaster is tempting, albeit cheesy, and the ringleader’s introductions to each of the seven total levels lent an admittedly lame, but flavorful sense of foreboding for what was to come. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here.  Feels less like a rollercoaster, and more like a walkthrough haunted house. Sadly, none of the levels really blew my mind or subverted my expectations across the roughly two hours it takes to complete them all. Rush of Blood starts to show the most potential for scares in level two, a meandering tour of a slaughterhouse for giant pigs. After a few silent turns through a room full of oversized carcasses the killing machines sprung into action, filling my ears with the sound of whirring saw blades and shrieking pigs. This incredibly gory sequence then segues into an Until Dawn-inspired nightmare that presented some of the strongest imagery in the entire game. In one part, the rollercoaster train rolls down a steep drop into a pitch-black abyss and slows to a pace once it reaches a crowd of huge, naked, empty-eyed dolls representing Josh’s friends. One of the dolls has a camera, filming you as you ride on past, just as they did with his sister Hannah the night she disappeared. The scene embodies the chilling nature of what these people did to humiliate their friend very well, but ultimately serves as an unusually eerie and bizarre high in a ride full of bland, boring lows.  After level two the environments get less and less interesting, blurring together into the same boring combination of rickety buildings and musty caves with equally uninspired enemy designs. You’ll fight evil clowns, annoying crows, giant spiders, and the dull, zombie-like wendigos recognizable from the main game. Sometimes, you can change things up by shooting railroad switches that pop up occasionally in most levels to change tracks and explore hidden side-passages full of targets, collectibles, and a much-needed change of scenery if you’re on a second or third playthrough.  Despite its blandness, it's still a decently fun ride. No matter how many detours you take though, it always culminates in an unremarkable final bossfight against an incredibly stupid-looking monster that seems out of place in something related to Until Dawn. I was drawn in far more by the use of 3D sounds in each level, which built an uncomfortable atmosphere while having the practical effect of alerting me to nearby threats. But as a result, jump scares are telegraphed way too often and the horror almost completely evaporates. After I realized how tame Rush of Blood’s scares were going to be it took a lot of the edge off, and the experience suffered. Long stretches of inaction serve as a breather from the mostly wave-based combat, and a way to rest your arms from the inevitable fatigue caused by the motion controls, but happen a bit more frequently than I would’ve liked — a problem in levels that last only about five to 15 minutes. More often than not, Rush of Blood feels less like a rollercoaster, and more like a slow walkthrough haunted house, and it’s about as scary too. Even as a mere horror-flavored rail shooter lacking in any serious scares, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood isn’t terrible. Responsive, arcade-style shooting, the frequency of collectibles, optional side passages that add some sense of exploration to the linear rollercoaster, and an end-of-level letter grade system offer plenty of casual replayability. Coupled with its smooth, motion-based controls, and barring some of its weaker stages, Rush of Blood actually makes for a decently fun ride.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	 The word “incredible” gets thrown around a lot, but virtual reality actually earns that praise: you literally won’t believe how well it works until you see it for yourself. The software side of things has been slow to catch up to the potential of VR headsets, but the technology itself is mindblowing because of the way it lets us interact with virtual worlds like we’re actually there – something that’d only been dreamed of until the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive came out earlier this year. It’s fantastic that Sony’s PlayStation VR headset will allow many more people to have these groundbreaking experiences by lowering the financial barrier to entry, with only a few compromises. Though the PlayStation VR is advertised at only $399.99, that price is misleading because it’s mostly useless without the $59.99 PlayStation Camera, which is sold separately. Additionally, many of the launch games either require or make use of one or two motion-tracked PlayStation Move controllers, which must also be purchased separately for between $20 and $30 each. Bundles (like the one on which this review is based) are available with the full set for $499.99, which is still a major price advantage. The HTC Vive, which includes its two Lighthouse sensors and motion controllers, costs $799.99; the Oculus Rift is $599.99 and comes with one sensor and an Xbox One controller (and its wireless dongle), but Oculus will soon release its Touch controllers for an as-yet-unannounced price that is speculated to be in the range of $200. So, combined with the fact that it hooks up to a $299.99 PlayStation 4 instead of a gaming PC that would cost you $700 or more, the PlayStation VR is by far the cheapest option for good-quality VR with motion control.  Cheaper almost always comes with a “you get what you pay for” caveat, and the PlayStation VR is no exception. But the impact of those differences is less than I’d expected when it comes to what happens when you put the headset on. One of the most important parts of a VR headset is the screen, and having used the higher-resolution Oculus Rift and HTC Vive (which both use two screens for a combined resolution of 2160x1200), I’m impressed at the quality of the PlayStation VR’s 1920x1080 image, which is split down the middle to display a different point of view for each eye. While the resolution is noticeably lower, the “screen door effect,” caused by the faint lines that separate the pixels on a display when you view it up close, is minimal. In-game text is very readable (though it must be larger than on other headsets to be legible). There’s also little or none of the visible radial lens pattern or streaking light effects I observed on the other two headsets.  I’m impressed at the quality of the PlayStation VR’s image. No matter which headset you choose you’ll see virtual worlds through what looks like SCUBA goggles. The field of view on the PlayStation VR is slightly lower than its competitors (meaning the goggles look thicker) but in the same ballpark; the differences between the three are minor enough that unless you’re directly comparing one after another you’re unlikely to notice. One of the big questions going in was whether the PlayStation 4 had enough horsepower to run games at the 90-frames-per-second rate that VR demands in order to minimize nausea. So far it has kept up admirably, with no significant frame rate dips in any of the games I’ve tried. That’s in both high-detail games like Batman: Arkham VR or EVE Valkyrie and low-detail ones like Tumble VR or Job Simulator. Again, it will never look as good as a Rift or a Vive on a gaming PC, which are capable of producing sharper and more detailed images, but the PlayStation VR does the job adequately. And with several people in the IGN office playing games on it over the past week, none has reported any unusual problems with nausea.   The other crucial part of a VR setup like this one is the motion tracking, and here is where I felt the pinch most. Relative to the Vive and its two sensors placed in opposite corners of your play area, the PlayStation VR’s reliance on its single camera is a significant weakness. It does work reasonably well thanks to the depth-sensing capabilities of its two lenses, but its field of view is narrow enough that I frequently bumped up against its limits with the Move controllers. With the recommended six feet of distance between me and the camera, I find I have to frequently adjust the angle to cover me when switching between a standing experience like Batman: Arkham VR and a sitting one like SuperHyperCube.  Motion Tracking is where I felt the pinch most. And even in the best-case scenario, it can’t cover your whole body and the floor around you, so if you see something shiny on or near the ground you can’t reach down to pick it up. All the games I’ve played thus far (such as Job Simulator, Tumble VR, and Batman) have accounted for this by simply warping items back to the playable height if you drop them, but it’s jarring to have your hand stop two feet from your target. You can tell someone they’re not supposed to do that until you’re blue in the face, but considering the whole point of VR is to fool people’s brains into thinking what they’re seeing is real, they will still make that mistake from time to time. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. Also, that inherent limitation means that even though we’re being immersed in a 360-degree virtual world where things can happen anywhere, we’ll never be able to turn around 180 degrees and shoot a monster that pops up behind us. Any time your body is between your hands and the PlayStation Camera, it has no way of knowing where they are and completely loses the ability to track them. (It’s difficult to directly compare the PlayStation Camera to the Rift’s single sensor because the Touch controllers aren’t available yet, but from my experience with head tracking the Rift’s field of view seems wider.)  Tracking works well the majority of the time, but when it doesn’t it’s frustrating. In general, the motion tracking reliability ranges from adequate to flakey, especially on Move controllers – for no reason I could pinpoint, it would sometimes wig out and one of my in-game hands would vanish or start flying away uncontrollably. Yet the next session in the same environment would be fine. To be clear, it works well the majority of the time, but when it doesn’t it’s frustrating.   It’s great that the DualShock 4’s light is finally useful for something: if a game supports it, you can see your controller in the VR environment exactly where you’re holding it, often with instructions on which button to push hovering over it. That can serve as a clumsy stand-in for Move controllers if you don’t have them – and this is something the Rift’s included Xbox One controller can’t do due to lack of a tracking light. But in many games, you’re required or strongly encouraged to use PlayStation Move controllers to interact with the virtual environments, which is a much more natural way of reaching out and touching things. Sony's use of the existing PlayStation Move controller that’s been around since 2010 has the benefit of there already being a bunch of them out there (though they’re likely pretty dusty) and their buttons and triggers are well suited for the tasks of representing hands that grasp objects or guns. It’s unfortunate there’s no rumble in them, though, because that’s the only tactile feedback that’s possible when trying to touch something that doesn’t exist or firing a gun that you expect to have a kick. [Correction: we're told there is rumble on the Move controllers, but in my experience it's so weak it might as well not be there.]
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	 Of all the games available at launch for the PlayStation VR, Battlezone VR best represents the blueprint for how traditional games will most likely look in virtual reality. The trick of making us a pilot inside a car, mech, or some other controllable vehicle is certainly a logical one, as it creates a believable reason for why you don’t need to move your real body to move around a game world. But once you bridge that cognitive gap you have to deliver an interesting game; Battlezone doesn't quite manage that in its single-player campaign, and its online muliplayer doesn't change the experience as much as you might think.  As a VR experience, it delivers - fulfilling many a sci-fi fan’s dream by putting them in the cockpit of a tank that may as well have been ripped right from the movie Tron and attacking them with similarly Tron-ish enemies in Tron-like environments that tower over you imposingly, thanks to a sense of scale that only virtual reality can truly deliver. Like many VR games, Battlezone makes a great first impression as a result, and its sound gamepad controls make it approachable to play to boot. Aiming is nicely tuned, with the reticule accelerating just the right amount for long sweeps to feel spry without it feeling too twitchy to make small adjustments. Movement feels a bit on the light side for a tank, though it is a hover tank, and it does have a pleasing sense of momentum and inertia as you switch directions or come to a halt, which successfully conveys the sensation of actually piloting a vehicle as opposed to just moving an avatar about. Little details like this make all the difference, because if you get them wrong they break sense of immersion that makes virtual reality magical. Battlezone VR thankfully doesn’t have that problem.   It does have others though. Its hex-based campaign map looks promising at first, creating the impression of a potentially deep single-player experience with meaningful strategic choices. But ultimately, though you can go where you’d like, it’s clear you are meant to head straight for the nearest enemy comms tower on the map and destroy it. With each passing mission it takes for you to cross the map and assault the enemy stronghold their forces gain strength, and veering off the beaten path doesn’t yield substantial enough rewards to make the increased difficulty worth dealing with. As a result, the map ends up being one big illusion of choice where there’s a clearly marked correct route, making your decision of where to head next mostly incidental.  In practice, the campaign winds up being a random series of missions picked from a small pool of possible objectives and map types. Some will have you just destroying waves of enemies, others will task you with escorting a friendly convoy from point A to point B, and so on. All of it is fairly rote, but that’s not the biggest issue. The real problem is that the simple act of shooting and destroying enemies feels rather dull and lifeless. None of the many weapon types in Battlezone generate a sense of power when you fire them.  From guided missile launchers to machine guns and auto-cannons, none of the many weapon types in Battlezone generate a sense of power when you fire them. Especially in VR, where it really seems as if I’m literally sitting right beneath a 120mm cannon as it goes off, Battlezone’s sound effects are middling and underwhelming. There’s also very little in the way of recoil, which along with the speedy aiming, generous amounts of ammo, and spritely handling creates a distinctly arcade feel that clashes with the fantasy of being in the cockpit of a war behemoth bristling with destructive heavy weaponry. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. This is made worse by the pushover AI that controls enemy vehicles. They’re happy to sit still for you while you lace into them with all you’ve got, and they’re more likely to drive into a wall and get stuck than they are to try and flank you. None of this would be too big of a deal if there was a lot to think about besides shooting, but there isn’t. Regardless of the scenario, all I really needed to do was mindlessly place my cursor over my target and fire away, and since that act isn’t really engaging, the whole experience winds up falling flat. It’s really too bad, because there is a surprising amount of potential for tactical consideration. There are different hull types, plus lots of different weapons and special abilities to combine into unique loadouts. There's even directional armor, which can be customized to have varying strength levels in different quadrants if you so choose. It’s a easy to see how all these elements could be interesting if missions challenged you in the right ways, but it all boils down to a simple shooting gallery, so none of that tactical potential ever gets realized.  Seeing as “Play Online” is the very first option on the main menu, you can imagine that it’s meant to be the main attraction and the single-player is here to act more as a way to build up currency to buy upgrades with. Sadly though, Battlezone's gameplay isn't any more tactical or interesting when playing in a group. The mission and level designs don't really provide opportunities to employ meaningful teamwork. Sure, adding a few friends to the mix makes just about anything more fun, but beyond that innate enjoyment, Battlezone doesn't really leverage the presence of other players in any sort of interesting way. Battlezone looks good and controls well, but offline there’s nothing to think about besides shoot, shoot, shoot, which in this case just doesn’t provide enough of a good time to be enjoyable for long. Adding a few friends to the mix online ups the fun factor nominally, but it lacks the deep, cooperative hooks to make anymore than a short-term distraction.
Jared Petty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	 When I’m not playing Superhypercube, I’m wishing I were playing Superhypercube. It’s a deep, beautiful, and superbly crafted arcade puzzle experience. It puts us through a nerve-wracking gauntlet of close scrapes peppered with opportunities to demonstrate a transcendent mastery that made me feel like a video game god.  The PlayStation VR is used to marvelous, subtle effect. Your perspective is fixed from behind the ever-advancing cube cluster, but you’re constantly peeking around the edges of your shape to get a look ahead and rotate it to match its silhouette to the rapidly-approaching target gap. As the cluster grows, getting a good look around it becomes a neck-craning element of the challenge that physically pulls you into the virtual reality in a very natural way. the challenge...physically pulls you into the virtual reality in a very natural way  Little design touches also go a long way. PlayStation VR knows your controller's location and projects a wireframe, annotated version into the virtual reality, a detail that subtly encourages your sense of presence in this world. New gates fade in from the artificial horizon, convincingly mimicking the emerging detail of a small distant object rapidly approaching in the VR headset. The otherworldly sounds heighten the atmosphere deliciously. The timing between each gate, the rare but terrifying boss walls, the high audio bleeps of victory and low hums of defeat are polished into highly effective instruments of tension. The sensation of barreling toward a new gate was like leaping over an abyss for the rung of a ladder, feeling the bar brush my fingertips, and wondering whether I’d make the catch or miss my grip.  Superhypercube commits to doing one thing magnificently... Leaderboards and personal bests are prominently displayed between matches just above the restart command, enticing you to jump back in, push your skills, and break through to the next boss wall. There are no special modes or game variants. Superhypercube commits to doing one thing magnificently: offering ever-increasing, tense challenges that test your skills as they grow. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here. As you push the envelope, Superhypercube's challenge scales with you. Greater risks are rewarded with higher scores and powerful special abilities, including time-slowing and a wall-smashing smart bomb. Superhypercube is simple, but thankfully the comprehensible premise doesn't confuse simplicity with shallowness. As your skill improves and the challenge increases, rotating and dropping the ever-changing three-dimensional shapes gets ever more engaging. When I eventually, inevitably crashed, I was always hammering restart the moment the prompt appeared. That’s the mark of an amazing puzzle game.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	 PlayStation VR Worlds seems like the demo disc that should’ve been included with the PlayStation VR. Some of its five bundled games are great demonstrations of what the PlayStation VR can do, but the others are throwaways that I’ll quickly forget I played. The star of the show is The London Heist. Aside from a brief puzzle scene in which you open a safe to steal a diamond, it’s little more than a shooting gallery with the Move controllers. There's one scene about shooting your way out of a robbery gone wrong and another where you ride shotgun in the getaway car and blast away at pursuers. Shooting is simple, but the experience of firing a virtual gun with a Move controller is still a great novelty, and reloading by popping magazines into your gun with the other hand is satisfying. It's a little annoying that there's no ammo counter for your gun to warn you when you're running low, but that made me try to keep track of how many shots I'd fired and made it slightly less mindless. Simply shooting things is far more fun this way than it is with a traditional game controller, so I can forgive a lack of significant enemy or weapon variety.   I enjoyed the sense of presence they gave off when sitting across the table from me. Surrounding the gunfights, The London Heist is dressed up with impressive cinematic monologs from a pair of highly detailed gangster characters. They’re well acted and impressively animated as they argue and posture, and though I didn't have enough time to get attached to them as characters in the short running time I enjoyed the sense of presence they gave off when sitting across the table from me asking for a light for their cigar or threatening me in a subway service station. After the hour-long story’s done there’s a set of three shooting gallery levels with leaderboards to play on. Free of the need to make things fit into a serious story, these ranges have a lot more fun with the idea: they throw in elements like friendly targets and paint cans moving along tracks that you have to shoot at the right time to knock them into appropriately colored bins. There's some replay value in setting high scores on there, which is good, because that's about all the replay value that PlayStation VR Worlds has to offer. Scavengers Odyssey, for instance, is a short and linear first-person shooter where you use the DualShock 4 to pilot a mech suit through a story of uninteresting sci-fi mysticism. Enemy variety is weak – only three aliens, counting the final boss, and a stationary turret – and there are only two weapons including a gravity gun, so combat is bland. The best thing about it is launching yourself between platforms, which I enjoyed for the sensation of movement as you trigger a leap to a pre-designated spot, and for the ability to double-jump and change directions mid-air. But it’s over in less than two hours, and there’s no reason I’d want to play it again. See more PlayStation VR launch game reviews here.  Without a multiplayer option to take on human opponents, Danger Ball will be short-lived. Danger Ball is basically first-person Pong for the VR era, and controlling your paddle by looking where you want it to go works great. This is the kind of game that can only really work with stereoscopic 3D, because you need to be able to tell how far away the incoming ball is, and the PlayStation VR handles that well. I was able to time the impact well enough to do a last-second flick of my head to put some English on the ball and make it curve in a direction of my choosing, which often threw off the AI player and scored an easy point. The different opponents do shake things up with unique powers, such as being able to launch two balls at you at once or a shield you need to break down before you can get it by them. However, they're not too bright, and it only took a couple of tries to beat the tournament mode. Without a multiplayer option to take on human opponents directly instead of just through the leaderboard on the simple score-chase mode, this one will be short-lived. VR Luge is about as simple and arcadey as you can get. You're put in the perspective of a luge racer coasting down busy streets, dodging cars by looking right and left. I think the biggest disappointment, besides the fact that head-on collisions with trucks barely slow you down, is that I didn't get as much of a sense of speed as I'd expected from being inches off the ground and allegedly moving at over 100 miles per hour. There’s some scenery and spectacle, but not much gameplay variety - you’re just dodging left and right using your head.  Ocean Descent isn’t a game, but an interesting passive experience in which you’re lowered hundreds of feet into the ocean in shark-proof cage. There’s some beautifully animated sea life and a little drama created by your crew on the radio, and it made me flinch a few times, but not much more than that. When you're done you can take the same trip again without the excitement or just sit underwater and watch the fish swim, but that would've been much more relaxing and meditative if there were an option to remove the ugly shark cage. It’s a shame these four games and one sightseeing trip aren’t sold separately, because as a mismatched hodgepodge it’s a lot harder to recommend as a whole than the good parts would have been on their own. The entertaining shooting gallery and drama of The London Heist carries the other three short and less interesting games and the passive Ocean Descent, and is likely the only one I'll remember.
Chase Becotte	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	 NBA 2K17 succeeds by touching a spot on the backboard most other sports games can’t jump up and reach. Even when it feels too grindy or misses a step, it provides diverse options and singular moments of basketball gameplay bliss that are hard to top. The NBA 2K series as a whole works for me because it excites me as an NBA super fan. It’s a game that celebrates the athletes, taps into the excitement of a big-time dunk, and allows me to customize who I want to be on the court. Sometimes I get flustered by a floaty pass or thrown off by a player like Kevin Durant or Andrew Wiggins looking far too skinny, but then I’ll hit a deep three with Steph Curry that makes the fans at Oracle Arena go ballistic and I’m all-in again.    It’s all about options and NBA 2K17 provides plenty of them. The same concept applies to just about every facet of NBA 2K17. I’m not in love with the grind of MyCareer mode, but the amount of options at my disposal in MyGM means I don’t care if I spend one more minute in MyCareer. On the court, some smart new tweaks let you get an extra boost to the accuracy of your jump shots by pulling straight down on the right stick, but you can also just press the “shoot” button if that doesn’t feel comfortable. In addition, you can now use the right stick to go for more varied steal attempts, or you can just continue to press the steal button. Again, it’s all about options and NBA 2K17 provides plenty of them.   Allen Iverson’s recent induction into the Basketball Hall of Fame feels all too perfect, as NBA 2K17’s focus on chaining together crossovers and spins seems like an homage to the signature style of its former longtime cover athlete. In previous NBA 2K games I often felt stuck in animations and not in control at all times, but now it’s much easier to string together dribbling maneuvers and put together a sequence that can leave defenders behind. This same type of flow carries over to shooting, where for the first time it feels like I have an ability to pull up off the dribble and really play in the space between the three-point line and the paint.  This idea of pace and space is all-important in an NBA video game. The added area creates more unique opportunities to score, and that leads to things like more creative passing, more fouls, and more scrambling on defense. The loopy passing that crops up here and there is especially frustrating because it interrupts some chances to really zip the ball around the perimeter to the open man for an open jump shot. The same can be said for some AI players still not quite running the right lanes during a fast break.  Shooters like J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard feel especially terrifying this season. On some level, though, the passing not always being pinpoint-accurate does perhaps save the defense. Shooters like J.J. Redick and Damian Lillard feel especially terrifying this season, and the AI is even smart enough to step back and make sure to get both feet behind the line for a three-pointer rather than a long two-point shot. On top of that, now that rebounds can be tipped out rather than just corralled, I’ve even seen instances where DeAndre Jordan tips a rebound back towards an open J.J. Redick for a wide-open three ball.  I also need to mention that the shooting mechanics have been tweaked so all “green” or perfect releases lead to made baskets. In the past, “green” didn’t always mean the shot would be successful, which could be confusing as there was no clear reason why getting a perfect release mattered. So thank you for clearing that up, 2K. Having this level of control all over the court is great, except when that control then vanishes. I can’t control how much heat to put on a pass; I can’t control how long it takes players at times to get in position to start a play; and I can’t control moments where I’m pushed 10 feet away from the ball handler on defense just because some random big man pushed me backwards under the rim. When things like that happen there’s no recourse, so the outcomes can sometimes feel unfair.  The commentary remains the best and most varied in the sports genre. All of the action on the court is highlighted by commentary that remains the best and most varied in the sports genre. David Aldridge is now roaming the sidelines, and Greg Anthony and Kevin Harlan are joined by a rotating crew of new announcers, such as Chris Webber, Clark Kellogg, Doris Burke, Brent Barry, and Steve Smith. However, having this amount of variety doesn’t come without some flaws. Chris Webber sounds like he’s eating his microphone at times, and Steve Smith is sort of boring. But Doris Burke and Brent Barry really shine.  The audio also falters a bit when it comes to the in-arena experience. There was a big focus on making each arena sound unique this season, but adding some unique sounds doesn’t cure everything. The rims sound different in the arenas, as well as the buzzers, but the ambiance is still off overall. To point to one example, it’d be that the crowds simply don’t sound excited enough or angry enough depending on the moment.   MyCareer is mostly carefree and non-linear this year, which is a positive coming off Spike Lee’s handcuffing story mode in NBA 2K16. However, when the focus isn’t on the basketball, that’s when MyCareer still loses me. MyCareer is, as always, built on grinding out points you can put towards leveling up your player. The problem is, going to “mandatory” practices and sponsorship events is mundane – and not being able to skip through cutscenes only adds another level to the grind. If I could just play the games and focus on getting closer with my teammates on the court, I would care a lot more about sticking with it. And I say that because the same love I have for the normal gameplay also goes for MyCareer. My AI teammates have been much more useful this year than in the past, and it feels great when you get on the same page as your main friend and teammate in the story, Justice Young, who is played well by Michael B. Jordan.  Moving beyond MyCareer, I go full basketball nerd when it comes to MyGM because the options really are close to limitless here. You can now expand the NBA to 36 teams if you want, and this comes with all the perks of building an arena and naming your team. The mode goes so much further than that as well by providing draft pick protections, a detailed way to handle your substitution patterns, and incorporating a multitude of highly specific details that are appreciated by my inner general manager. The trade engine in place is mostly solid as well. Some players like Rudy Gobert are not quite valued as they should be, but most other big names like LeBron James or top-flight rookies like Ben Simmons come with high price tags. When starting your MyGM you don’t even have to start from the present day. You have the option to go back to before this year’s draft and decide to pass on Ben Simmons and select Brandon Ingram or even Dragan Bender as the top pick in the draft. When the real NBA season begins you will also be able to start your MyGM mode at the current date. This means if the Hawks get off to a 10-0 start you will be able to select the Hawks and begin your MyGM mode with a 10-0 record. In short, it’s really to a point now where you can customize MyGM mode to a dizzying degree. ...And seriously, it’s amazing the option to “pick swap” is something that’s included in a NBA video game in 2016 – thanks, Nets and Celtics. Finally, the online portion of NBA 2K17 has been stable so far. MyPark suffers from a bit of input lag here and there, and the MyTeam auction house can be a bit slow at peak hours, but in comparison to previous NBA 2K games where entire modes were broken for days or weeks after release, this has been a very successful launch. Furthermore, while there is no big new online feature, MyLeague has been expanded upon to feature something that more closely resembles (but can't quite match) the online franchise modes in games like MLB The Show and Madden NFL. NBA 2K17 is another rock-solid game in the franchise. It features worthwhile updates to the dribbling and shooting mechanics, and backs up those improvements off the court in ways that make me care about managing my team. All in all, I know NBA 2K17 will be in my gaming rotation for many months to come.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/worms-wmd-review	 As strategy games go, Worms WMD isn't the biggest gun in the battle, but it's very easy to underestimate. This 2D battler can hold its own next to bigger and more self-serious strategy games using cartoonishly violent charm and clever weaponry that showcase exactly why the two-decade-old Worms series has stuck around so long. Unless you've been living under a rock in the same way real worms do, you know how Worms' simple turn-based action-strategy combat works: You have a few seconds to move one of your squishy squad members around the map, and your turn ends once the timer elapses, a combat option is performed, or (most embarrassingly) you accidentally trigger an explosive or fall from a great height. Then the enemy gets a turn, and you can only watch and hold your breath to hope the AI or your human opponent will do something hilariously stupid instead of blasting one or more of your crew to bits. It’s a time-tested system that rewards both careful tactical positioning and reflexes and technique as you use their many gadgets to climb tricky terrain and reach an advantageous position.  The charm of Worms comes with the eponymous invertebrates and their vast arsenal of items. The cute creatures squeal jokey phrases with plenty of British slang as they crawl, hop, swing, and fly across the destructible stages with diverse gear such as jetpacks, parachutes, and grappling hooks. Once the enemy is in range, it's all a matter of skillfully deploying over-the-top attacks that range from baseball bats and Street Fighter-inspired fire punches all the way up to burrowing missiles and airstrikes. In fact, there are almost too many items to keep track of at the start, especially if you're a newcomer. You can play through the dozens of training games for many of WMD's weapons and traversal items, but some of those are a bit on the boring side. Fortunately, there's more reason to return to those missions than just sharpening combat skills as high scores are tracked and XP can be earned toward customization options. If anything, the amount of training games is so vast that it's a little disappointing that a handful of items are left off because they seem like they might’ve been among the most entertaining. Some of WMD's weirder items like the Dodgy Cell Phone Battery, the Concrete Donkey, the Old Lady, and the Poke are under-explained, meaning fodder - I mean inexperienced players - have to experiment in the middle of a battle and potentially waste a move when learning about the uses for certain weapons.  WMD's biggest new gambit are powerful but risky vehicles like tanks and helicopters. All of those items are mostly standard Worms equipment that build on the many prior Worms games (inasmuch as exploding batteries and donkeys as weapons are standard) but Worms WMD's biggest new gambit comes in the form of powerful but risky vehicles like tanks, mechanized suits, and helicopters. Most of those add some good high-powered destructive capability to your team; the tank and its multi-shot cannon is a godsend, and if you can properly pilot the slippery choppers you can deal some damage from above with its down-facing machine gun. The mech suits' melee attacks, however, are usually more trouble than they're worth due to the many explosives they can accidentally trigger. Far more dependable are the stationary turrets you can build or find throughout the many stages - sacrificing mobility for firepower can really pay off if you know when to use it.   Crafting adds a new quirk to combat - you can do it while enemies move. Another usually welcome WMD innovation is that you can assemble new weapons and items from elements collected on the battlefield. It adds a new quirk to combat since you can start crafting while enemies make their moves, and it can make multiplayer matches even more unpredictable since enemies only know that you've made something but aren't told exactly what. The crafting system could be a bit more user friendly by pointing out which items are necessary to craft what items on certain stages (for example, whether a jetpack is needed on a map when a grappling hook can be made instead), and since elements are collected in bulk some of the recipes are a bit too convoluted. But has crafting become more and more enjoyable the longer I play WMD. Something I'm still struggling with, though, is WMD's use of buildings. I like the idea of taking shelter from the many explosives and air strikes (as well as the risk-reward balance between discovering collectibles or active mines inside), and that it’s not a complete safe haven as there are items that can kill campers like a drilling missile, a blowtorch that can blast through walls. Where I find issue with WMD's buildings is that so many of the maps fail to make clear which structures can actually be entered and which are just ornate environmental elements. Even when I can tell a giant castle or building can be entered, the entrance points are often difficult to discern. For the larger structures, I've often wasted an entire turn hopping and flipping about trying to find a way into the building. But between the challenge of the missions and their side objectives, there's plenty of reason to continue the fight before even turning to the dependably entertaining multiplayer. Taking on a complete stranger in a 20-minute online war as you whittle each other's ranks down is far more exciting than it has any right to be, but Worms' charms are amplified when playing locally. With the considerable cost of extra controllers, it’s great that the turn-based style of WMD's two-player combat can be pulled off by passing one controller back and forth. The only time a multiplayer match drags is during stalemates where the environment is so thoroughly destroyed and sapped of all resources in such a way that the combatants couldn't reach each other, but those have been rare. Just about everything you do in Worms WMD earns XP that unlocks new voice packs, hats, and even tombstones left behind by the worms that fall in battle. You can also rename teams and individual soldier names (I named my squadmates after actors from The Expendables) which invites you to become more attached to them and amplifies the tension when they’re in danger. However, as someone who’s spent so many years with the extra customization on PC with rejiggering sound files, it's a shame WMD doesn't allow us to record our own taunts and victory jingles. Worms WMD is a dependable soldier when it comes to laugh-out-loud competitive warfare. It may not have flashy 3D graphics or big-budget actors reenacting huge battles, but its cartoony 2D conflicts are a fun way to test your combat prowess with some weird and wacky weapons.
Miranda Sanchez	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/attack-on-titan-review	 Attack on Titan is a peculiar beast, and I’m not just thinking about the disturbingly naked giants that prance around and try to bite your head off. Developer Omega Force’s third-person action game interpretation of the franchise goes through the plot of the anime and takes the first stab at adapting a bit of the manga that the anime has yet to cover. While it does a great job of capturing the brutal essence and fast action of the show, it has mixed results presenting the manga’s content and its own slog of an original ending in an interesting way. If you’ve never experienced Attack on Titan, this isn’t the worst way to do it — that would be Attack on Titan: Humanity in Chains — but of course it’s not as good as manga either. The roughly 15-hour campaign hits all the essential plot events as Eren and his crew join the military and seek revenge against the titans for destroying their families, homes, and lives, but you’ll miss a lot of the more nuanced details and political scenes. That’s not too bad for the campaign, though: the focus isn’t on Attack on Titan’s politics, but on decimating titans. I found a lot of the cutscenes to be a nice refresher for some events I forgot.  The introduction to subjugating titans is a little intimidating, but the controls are rather intuitive once you get used to the combo of swinging, targeting, then slashing the back of a titan’s neck. Once I did, I practically flew through the map as I hunted down targets using the omni-directional maneuver gear (which lets you move a lot like Spider-Man) to swing between buildings and trees with peak efficiency.  Executing this move perfectly time after time made me feel powerful. Engagements are quick, but require precision: after locking onto one of five possible locations on a titan’s body, you’ll need to gain speed and hit the attack button at just the right time to do the most damage possible. Executing this perfectly time after time made me feel powerful, but it took me a while to get there. If you do execute the combo incorrectly — attack at the wrong time or if you attack without enough speed — you’ll disconnect from the titan and fall back to the ground. This gives titans an opportunity to trample, hit, or grab you. Sometimes I got careless while I was targeting a titan’s limb, and the beast would snatch me out of the air, or throw their arm so that I was flug far away. If you miss an attack, a message flashes on the screen about why you failed. That was helpful while I learned how to master the system.  It’s gross, but there’s a weird satisfaction in coming out of a fight drenched in titan blood. While taking on one or two titans isn’t too difficult, the diversity in size and type of titan kept me on my toes. An abnormal crawling titan that leapt in the air was a lot harder to subjugate than a relatively small, five-meter titan that went down in one hit. As I progressed to later missions and faced more specialized enemies, like the female titan that more actively blocks attacks and counter-attacks, I found myself needing to be more tactical with my resources and play to my character’s strengths.  Different ability combinations help characters feel more authentic. One of the things that kept the constant titan hunt fresh was the character roaster. Though you’ll mainly play as Eren, Armin, Mikasa, or Levi, there is a point where the campaign allows you to play missions as one of 10 characters, and each has their own combat style that matches their personality. For example, Armin isn’t the strongest fighter but he is a brilliant tactician, so to match that, while playing as him or another leader-type character you’ll have the ability to direct a squad of collected comrades to attack certain points on a titan. Then we have Levi, one of the fastest and strongest fighters, so he has the ability to attack multiple times after the first hit. Combat abilities learned through leveling up may repeat between characters, but the different ability combinations helped them feel more authentic.  The first chunk of the campaign has nice mission and map variety; I got to traverse plains on horseback, escort terrified settlers to safe zones, and stop the female titan from completely obliterating the Stohess District. Each mission also features side quests with various characters that, when helped, can either give you more supplies or join you in combat. It’s not necessary, but hearing them scream when they’re defeated wasn’t really an option for me, either, because Omega Force captures the horror of Attack on Titan well. When random scouts sometimes get grabbed and eaten by titans, the sound is bloodcurdling. Their deaths don’t affect success in the mission, but I always made sure to get revenge.  I just wish these unlockables would have been introduced earlier. The credits roll after completing the anime’s story, which took me roughly seven hours, but weirdly enough the campaign isn’t over. Instead, the floodgates open and Omega Force awkwardly adds a few new features to go with its original take on what happens next in the story. In the lengthy epilogue you can buy weird statues of titans to display in your camp and in multiplayer mode, and receive requests from other characters. The requests were simple (kill a certain number of titans, get a certain score, recruit so many members) and completing them means you’ll be rewarded with funny cutscenes and the occasional costume. I was really happy when I unlocked Cleaning Levi – I just wish these would have been introduced earlier so I could’ve enjoyed them in the main campaign.   Survey missions make sense contextually, but they go on for far too long. Unfortunately, the epilogue doesn’t flow too well. The few regular story missions in the epilogue are broken up by long, boring stretches of repetitive survey missions, which are essentially missions on old maps to eliminate titans or save a few settlers. They make sense contextually — of course you’d want to scout out and eliminate threats in an area before moving on — but they go on for far too long. On average it took me about an hour to get through enough survey missions before unlocking the next story mission. A lot of the missions themselves are short, but replaying a bunch of maps for hours and not receiving much story content gets stale quickly. It feels like Omega Force tried to pepper the character requests and their respective scenes to break up the monotony of the padded-out survey missions, but they’re not frequent enough to jolt me out of the tedium. Pair that with the slow reveal of information from the story battles and the epilogue just moves too slowly. It’s still fun to take out titans with your character of choice, but this section definitely needed some of those survey missions cut. On the plus side, you can get through some of those survey missions with friends in multiplayer, and the progress and items you earn in multiplayer carry over to your campaign. It’s fun to work with other people to take down objectives and race each other to get the most titan subjugations, plus playing with others helped me to clear some of those survey missions faster. Slaying titans is a satisfying, bloody mess thanks to fun and fast combat. The meat of the campaign follows the anime through fun missions and features varied playstyles for each of the characters that matched their personalities well. While the epilogue suffers from serious pacing problems, being able to get through some of its more tedious missions with friends make the extra content a little less of a pain.
Darry Huskey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/24/king-of-fighters-14-review	 The King of Fighters XIV is an unapologetically complex game with a learning curve that ramps up into a sheer wall at times, but scaling that wall is a big part of the fun. Taking the time to explore the massive cast of fighters and master their intricate abilities is a test of dexterity and patience, but it delivers a satisfying experience perfect for those looking for a challenge to conquer. The transition to polygonal graphics from the historical sprites hasn’t exactly been kind to it, but this is still an excellent entry in the series. King of Fighters XIV is nearly exhausting in the sheer amount of content it contains. There’s enough here to spend hours learning various moves, characters, and combinations and still feel as if you’ve barely scratched the surface. A total of 50 individual fighters provides nearly unparalleled variety when choosing just who to take with you onto the field of battle. Most of the men and women vying for the title of the King of Fighters feel unique, some radically so, such as Angel and the impressive variety of her Unchain Circle combo attacks.  Eighteen of the combatants are all-new to the series with this game. Most of the new arrivals fit right in with the old favorites, like Kukri, who can harness various projectiles to confound opponents and pour on the pressure. Others carry on the King of Fighters tradition of groups of characters representing countries and areas from around the globe, such as Nelson, Zarina, and Bandeiras who form Team South America.   This seemingly endless variety of fighting styles and matchups really comes to a head when deciding which three fighters will make up your team. Making adjustments to your regular crew by replacing a character to shore up a weakness might shift the synergy of the entire team, requiring you to use a new style with old favorites. You may try a new fighter that you feel makes good use of your Max meter and play them last, but if you add in another character that fills the same function you may need to learn to play them without spending resources, or perhaps change them out entirely. There are, for instance, no less than four different ways just to jump - nothing is simple.  Since you need to become proficient with at least three characters, as opposed to just one in most other fighting games, there’s a tremendous amount to learn. There are, for instance, no less than four different ways just to jump - nothing is simple. You’re given the tools to learn though, including a Trial mode which will teach you basic and intermediate combos for every character, but it’s up to you to put in the work. The options are almost too plentiful, but exploration of the nearly endless combinations of characters, maneuvers, and matchups is a large portion of the appeal. Action is often frantic and it’s generally geared more towards offense. Dashes, rolls, and hops help you to apply pressure, and damage really ramps up in the later portions of a bout when both players have a lot of Max meter to work with. Making a defensive mistake against a skilled opponent late in a match could cost you a character, adding tension to each of your decisions. That said, big damage doesn’t come easy; even for those familiar with other fighting games  KoF’s complicated controller motions and button combinations may seem daunting or alien at first. Finally landing that crazy, character-killing combo late in a match after practicing it for hours in training is hugely satisfying, and it’s that particular rush that kept me coming back for more.   Moments like that are hard to come by online, sadly. In its current form netplay is a big black fly in the punch bowl. Online multiplayer is inconsistent in quality at best, with matches often reduced to a stuttering and unplayable mess. It is possible to find smooth fights when carefully matching against players with strong internet connections, but it requires patience and a little searching. Even attempts to fight players on medium-strength connections were sluggish and hitched.  Despite running at a smooth 60 fps though, King of Fighters XIV doesn’t look great. This game marks a transition from the series’s traditional 2D sprites to more modern 3D-rendered models on a 2D plane, similar to Street Fighter V. Oddly, despite the in-game animations being fluid and the fighter models being well crafted, characters in cutscenes aren’t animated as skillfully, looking stiff and clumsy. These brief glimpses of the simple plot are also graphically shabby, with the vignettes looking more like they belong in an early PlayStation 3 game. The cutscenes and quick in-game interactions between characters fail to give a comprehensive understanding of anyone’s motivations, which was really frustrating considering how initially appealing some of these characters are at first glance. Despite running at a smooth 60 fps though, King of Fighters XIV doesn’t look great.  Though technically lacking, strong art direction throughout the 19 vibrantly colored stages and 50 distinct characters helps to establish a fantastic atmosphere for the over-the-top proceedings. The environments range from an abandoned church to an aircraft carrier to the Great Wall of China. Most of the characters are equally visually striking, like Chinese opera dancer Mian and her traditional stage garb, or the mysterious luchador known as King of Dinosaurs, a rudo fighter wearing a Tyrannosaurus mask. Even with so many fighters to choose from, most of them sport radically different character designs. This actually made me want to learn new fighters; I spent hours in Training mode checking out various fighters and seeing what they could do based simply on the fact their appearance alone made them interesting. King of Fighters XIV offers an astonishing amount of content, with nearly double the playable characters of most other games available on day one. The fighters themselves are interesting and well designed, both visually and mechanically, and they push limits with an execution ceiling higher than perhaps any other fighting game. King of Fighters XIV’s netcode and technical shortcomings are itis biggest stumbling blocks, but mastering its characters and leveraging what you’ve learned remains satisfying regardless. There are no shortcuts to becoming the new King of Fighters, but the journey to the top is well worth taking.
Dustin Toms	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	 There isn’t much better than going head-to-head against my buddies in a good Madden game, talking trash, bragging about that big play, and flaunting my victories to the point of unsportsmanlike conduct. Madden NFL 17 couples all of that with elevated gameplay mechanics, improved on-field player interactions, and a long-awaited emphasis on franchise mode. It’s great to see that this series has finally found the sweet spot it hasn’t seen since Madden NFL 05. Madden 17’s gameplay has risen above the last decade’s worth of iterations, and it starts with the feel I get when I grab the sticks. Madden 15 and Madden 16 focused gameplay tuning on defense and receiving, respectfully, due to the NFL’s shift towards the two play styles. It was EA’s reaction to the shift in the NFL. I was surprised to see the limelight on the running game this year, mainly because it’s EA with a proactive approach, a refreshing turn of events for the studio.  This year Madden continues to strengthen its gameplay by integrating the consistent button-pressing mini-game into the ground game. It gives you options to spin, juke, and stiff-arm, and it’s invigorating to scamper for a long gain thanks to a well-timed spin-break-spin combo. The new ground game is refreshing, keeping you honest on both offense and defense. It’s so easy to get caught up in pass after pass in today’s NFL, but with such a large emphasis in Madden NFL 17’s run game it encourages you to be patient and to run an offense the way it’s meant to be in the real sport.  Seeing play styles come across so fluidly creates realism. For example, the Vikings run a ground-heavy attack with Adrian Peterson, as do the Titans with the newly acquired DeMarco Murray. Peterson and Murray bowl through opponents, shove them to the ground, and fight for the extra yards. That’s a great positive contrast to Madden 16, where each team felt so similar on the ground that it didn’t matter if you were using Peterson or Murray or some no-name rookie. Seeing these play styles come across so fluidly in Madden 17 creates the realism factor the game has been sorely missing. Part of the reason the run game works so well with the Vikings and Titans is because of the above-average offensive line each team rosters. I was easily able to gain downhill momentum to carry Murray to extra yardage, and it was awesome using Peterson’s strength to keep pushing defenders to the ground thanks the holes created. Meanwhile a team like the Seahawks, who have one of the highest team ratings, sports one of the lowest-rated lines around. Playing as them it’s tough to run between the tackles as the line gets pushed around. Even on pass plays, I found myself using Russell Wilson’s legs as an escape route to avoid pressure. Again, this tweak to the ground game balance makes a team play more like its real-life counterpart than ever before. In addition, broadcast camera angles during and between plays represent a lifelike television experience I’ve grown to love.   I’m engaged on every single defensive play. The improved realism doesn’t stop on one side of the ball. Newly introduced gap assignments have me focused more on the defensive front seven, giving me the opportunity to shut down any given play if executed properly. That’s a huge and important change, because in the past few Maddens the defensive gameplay has been so boring I felt like I could put the controller down and let the CPU play for me. Now I’m engaged on every single defensive play, because you have to be in order to succeed. It’s like there’s an entire half of the game that wasn’t there before. Plus, I can trust my AI teammates to make plays and stay where they need to. And as players crash through each other during play, slick and unobtrusive in-game overlays effectively convey essential stat information, such as rushing yards, tackles and pass completions. At the same time there are a few new features that flounder. There was a lot of offseason jargon about letting special teams make an impact in Madden 17, and in the lead up to starting launching the game I enjoyed drills on how to block kicks, run trick plays, and strategically punt. They all worked surprisingly well in the training mode, and found myself smirking after a perfectly blocked field goal thinking about how I’d use these moves on the field. But once I entered real gameplay, special teams felt the same as it always has. After playing multiple games I didn’t once have a successful attempt at blocking a kick or punt. They should be few and far between to feel realistic – I get that – but after all of that training I expected to have at least one special teams play that truly shifted a game’s outcome. Their rarity is disappointing. Each of these new gameplay mechanics can seem daunting, especially for a Madden newcomer. I would recommend trying out the Skill Trainer, which will teach you how to read formations and play the right coverages. It’s beginner mode, but it’s where champions are made. The instructions make the basics of Madden 17 simple and easy to learn. I’ve been playing since Madden 01, and I still jump in for a refresher every season.  The duo of Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis taking over in the booth for commentary is a long overdue change, but despite EA’s promise that this would be a more conversational commentary team, I’m not convinced. The play-by-play from Gaudin sounds very similar to past versions. Davis’ commentary is okay, as he does have player-specific lines that tell stories of yesteryear, but that comes with the drawback that I was already hearing repeated lines in the second game I played. Where’s the banter? Where’s the chemistry? There is EA’s promise of updated and relevant commentary throughout the season, but as of now I’m unimpressed. This pair of wet blankets set the presentation back a few notches. As expected from an annual update, popular modes such as Madden Ultimate Team and Draft Champions have returned largely unchanged. Ultimate Team has added additional customization options as well as a new chemistry feature, while Draft Champions is identical. I’ll be the first to admit I’m not the biggest fan of the collectible trading card modes, but this year’s game has such a huge focus on gameplay and franchise that most everything else is secondary.   I love being able to take control of a franchise; it’s my favorite mode in any sports game. It’s that gratifying feeling of drafting a super stud in the fifth round and seeing him develop into a top-tier talent. In Madden’s upgraded Franchise mode, that concept is kicked into overdrive and gives me everything I want at a more rapid pace.  This new mode has me flying through each week of my franchise completing every single task. Franchise’s new Play the Moments super-sim mode places you into a game only during key moments, like third downs, red zones, and defensive stands. I’ve never been a super-sim fan before, but this new mode has me flying through each week of my franchise completing every single task. It’s great that Play the Moments gets me through a game with realistic statistics within 30 minutes, leaving ample time to complete weekly tasks. In another very smart tweak, upgrading players now happens immediately following a game, with practice second on the list. I used to skip all of these tasks to get to the next week as quickly as possible, but now it keeps a constant flow of progression. All of them are now pieces that are vital for success. It reminds me of how immersed I used to get with EA’s old NCAA Football franchise, which is a sports gaming compliment of the highest order. The already-awesome scouting system returns, but the biggest changes happen during the NFL Draft. The coolest part is how you will receive feedback immediately following your draft pick, showing the player’s overall True Talent ranking compared to his draft selection. Even better is the AI’s competency; teams actually draft based on need! My jaw dropped looking at the positional needs lining up with the teams in the draft. I was pumped to see the Bears take a quarterback at No. 1 overall; Seeing the 49ers trade up and reach for a quarterback at No. 6 was even better. Realism! At offseason’s end you can move onto preseason, or you can sim ahead a full decade – an option that simulation nuts like myself love. When I tried it, to my surprise each team was balanced with only a few superstars scattered throughout the league, including the aforementioned Bears draft pick sitting pretty at 95 overall. The majority of the league was filled with EA’s created draft classes, but it was properly balanced throughout each roster - proof that the progression system is working. Major community-requested features have been added as well. Full player editing and accurate equipment pieces add another level of customization that the franchise has been lacking for years. The score ticker has also been added, sharing scores and stats from across other games at the bottom of your screen. The ticker will highlight important updates, including divisional opponents. I found myself getting excited seeing my rivals fall as I was gaining them in the standings. My personal favorite, which had been absent from this series for far too long, is the return of formation subs. These seem like small details, but it’s all necessary to recreate a Sunday afternoon in loving detail. I’m already itching to restart my franchise when the season begins. Madden has finally found its comfort zone between the tackles, and offense and defense have reached a great balance. The community’s gameplay wishes were granted with a new focus on Franchise mode, led by the Play the Moments feature. Outside of its mood-killing commentators, Madden 17 is just about everything we’ve been waiting for since EA Sports took full control of the NFL license. Football is back, and it’s only a yard or two short of becoming an all-time great.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	 A good game is often said to be more than the sum of its parts – a special, unquantifiable feeling that comes from seeing every mechanic working seamlessly together to create variety and surprises. No Man’s Sky, by contrast, is a huge collection of parts that can’t find that harmony. To its credit a few work brilliantly - specifically the unheard of scale and scope of its procedurally generated sci-fi universe and often striking interplanetary exploration that allows you to hop in a spaceship and fly seamlessly to the surface of another planet. But too many other systems are badly designed and repetitive, from its basic and dull combat to its toothless survival systems, and from its unwieldy interface to its lifeless alien races. The vague, barely-there story starts each of us on a random planet (one of a claimed 18 quintillion) with a broken spaceship and the sci-fi equivalent of Minecraft’s pickaxe: a laser beam that slowly vacuums up a planet’s resources for you to feed into typical, simplistic crafting recipes. At first I was struck by the impressive world around me, which in this particular case was lush with colorful plant and animal life straight out of a Dr. Seuss book and rolling purple hills dotted with pillars of minerals. I named it Stapleton’s Landing and uploaded it to the server – though I’ll probably never see it again, another player might one day stumble across it and wonder who I was. (As far as we’ve seen so far this is the extent of No Man’s Sky’s multiplayer interaction in every reported test to date – even people who have gone to the same place at the same time haven’t been able to see each other.)   Visual variety is No Man’s Sky’s strong suit. Other worlds I’ve visited since have run the gamut between similarly exotic and as barren and desolate as Mars or the moon, with interesting features ranging from labyrinthine caves to impossibly floating islands and otherworldly rock formations. Landing on a new planet is usually an impressive high point because visual variety is No Man’s Sky’s strong suit. However, when you start moving around some of that beauty is lost. Because the draw distance for high-detail models is so short you’ll constantly see objects phase in and out with a distracting dithering effect, and the frame rate frequently dips below the 30 it shoots for just from panning around the environment. Especially when flying fast and low over a planet – as you do frequently when hunting for rare resources or buildings – the pop-in is tough to look past. So are the crashes, of which I’ve experienced about a dozen so far. This is the most crash-prone PS4 game I’ve ever played. But then you get in your ship and fly straight up off the surface and clear the atmosphere of a planet directly into space, then zip over to a neighboring world and land on its surface without any loading, and it’s hard not to be impressed. That’s an experience I’ve always wanted in games, and No Man’s Sky pulls it off. It’s a great moment of glory, and one that’s badly needed as virtually everything between those moments is a repetitive, frustrating, and confusing slog. While the tutorial is sufficient to get you up and running with your handy jetpack, basic crafting skills, and a working spaceship capable of interstellar jumps toward the goal of reaching the center of the galaxy, there’s a huge amount of important information it never introduces you to. Things as fundamental as how to switch your multitool from mining mode to combat mode and back to more nuanced things like how ship upgrades depend heavily on placement to function best aren’t addressed at all. In general, No Man’s Sky does a poor job of teaching you how to play, so you should expect to lean heavily on external guides if you don’t want to waste time figuring out its opaque systems for yourself.   Few of the upgrades I’ve worked for felt like a significant improvement. Most of the moment-to-moment gameplay in No Man’s Sky is a typical and dull resource-harvesting grind, running from pile to pile and hoovering up minerals and elements like iron, nickel, and plutonium. There’s nothing inherently wrong with resource harvesting, mind you - many great games are built on top of it. The issue here is that No Man’s Sky doesn’t do anything interesting with that foundation to distinguish it from the last game in which you harvested resources and combined them into other things, and so it’s unremarkable. Worse, few of the upgrades I’ve worked for felt like a significant improvement, with the exception of improvements to my warp drive and simple updates that upgrade my mining speed and rate of fire. As always in this genre there’s a compulsive collector’s urge that drives me to spend time meticulously gathering stuff, but it’s still a chore; and the way tiny bits of material defy gravity and hang in the air after you’ve destroyed the parts that were holding it up instead of falling into an easily targetable pile make trying to get all of it an annoying chore. In a game with so much inventory management the experience of actually managing it is important to get right – and No Man’s Sky botches it with a clumsy cursor-driven interface. Using the thumbsticks to navigate your cursor over the grids of your three different inventory screens (for your suit, your ship, and your multitool) just feels like the wrong tool for the job, especially since it doesn’t snap into position and can often land right in the middle of two options. Bafflingly, the cursor is even used to select between dialogue options; if I were challenged to come up with a more frustrating and less efficient way of choosing between two or three options with a gamepad thumbstick, I would be hard-pressed to make a worse one. Speaking of poor control, the galactic map where you choose which solar system to visit next is also a pain point. Getting the hang of selecting the star I wanted to go to took some effort, and even after dozens of jumps it doesn’t always move in the direction I’m expecting when I push the stick toward the next star along the path. But, since there’s almost never any indication of what a given star system will contain before you get there, it doesn’t really make a huge difference which one you go to. If you’re looking for a certain mineral to complete an upgrade to your ship, the only way to find out if a planet has it is to land and look around. So the choice of where to go next is completely uninformed, and therefore meaningless.   The combat experience is pretty miserable. Mining and exploring is sometimes interrupted by combat, such as when the temperamental Sentinel drones that apparently guard everything in the universe with varying degrees of zeal decide you’ve crossed their arbitrary lines, or when you decide to pick a fight. That combat experience is pretty miserable; most of the targets you’re shooting at are small floating drones, which would ordinarily be difficult to hit. However, No Man’s Sky’s aggressive auto-aim means you only have to get the crosshairs on them for a second, then just point in their general direction to finish them off. It’s as bland as can be. All efforts to make combat more interesting ended up making it worse. The craftable modifiers you can attach to your weapon to change it from a submachine gun-style attack to a shotgun or burst rifle just mean the auto-aim lock is broken more frequently by reloads or breaks in firing, forcing you to retarget these small flying things to establish it again. For some reason you can also make bolts reflect off of objects, which seems exceptionally useless because there’s no way you’re ever going to hit something with a reflected shot in an outdoor environment. If there are more upgrades out there I haven’t seen any hint of them, but even if they exist I’ll be surprised if any of them can make this basic, uninteresting shooting feel fun.  I also loathe having to pop open my inventory halfway through a battle to recharge my weapon if I happen to run out of reloads. The inventory window doesn’t pause the action, but it does prevent you from moving, so you’re just taking a beating until you can work through that awful interface. And while you’d think loading your gun with plutonium rather than carbon would produce a different effect, there’s no such subtlety involved. So why isn’t it automated? Just to create more busywork. Of course, the Sentinels are so bad at their jobs that you can basically just walk away from them. They’re all-seeing and can spontaneously spawn out of thin air as needed, but their attention span is laughably short. It’s to the point where I was able to run around a planet grabbing protected items at will with impunity because they couldn’t be bothered to chase me for more than 15 seconds or so. Even when their bigger, death-ray-packing friends show up they’re easily dispatched (grenades take them down quickly) or avoided.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	 The act of moving through Bound’s unique, abstract, and utterly gorgeous world is unlike anything I’ve ever experienced in games. Developer Plastic, which previously worked on ambitious-if-not-strange PS3 projects like Datura and Linger in Shadows, has taken the simplistic core of a 3D platformer and injected it with some  impressive style and vision. While the camera can’t quite keep up with the world, the “how” and “what” of dancing through it makes Bound a memorable experience. Though you might not be able to tell at first glance, the story is as simple as a fairytale: you play as a princess who sets out to protect her mother and her kingdom from a beast known as...wait for it...The Monster. But it only takes a second to realize that the princess moves with the elegance and precision of a ballerina – the way you can glide across the air, transition from one motion to another, and use her body as a canvas of expression is unlike any other character I can recall, and controls so well I felt like a dancer myself.   There’s also a series of interstitials that tell a tale much more grounded in reality. The delivery is obtuse, but the pieces I stitched together told an effective, if not entirely predictable emotional story. I won’t go into spoilers, but it deals with some themes and ideas that games generally don’t touch, which I definitely applaud.  It’s like an M.C. Escher painting colliding with Bauhaus. The worlds that you explore in Bound expand and contract like a living, breathing organism. Platforms manifest in space, the ground pulsates with an internal rhythm, and walls shatter apart and piece themselves together at will. It’s like an M.C. Escher painting colliding with Bauhaus, which I’ve never really seen before in a game, but holy hell do I appreciate it. While the camera does its best to keep up with the oscillations and transformations of the space around you, I oftentimes found myself having to come to a halt and rejigger the view in order to find my place in the environment. In a game that’s at its best when you’re moving, having to stop for this reason is a bummer. However, when I got going I found myself just rolling, leaping, and spinning around gorgeous minimalist spaces for minutes on end just because it looked and felt so unique.   The levels also accommodate to your own personal skill-set. Once I became confident with my ability to bounce off walls and accurately long-jump, I found myself able to gracefully skip full sections of levels. What started as a timid trio of small hops turned into one gigantic, dangerous leap once I became adept at Bound’s controls. The sensation of becoming better and more comfortable with the controller in my hand felt greatly empowering.  So much emotion is gleaned from the animation. So much emotion is gleaned from the animation. The way the Princess’ body flattens against a wall, stretches mid-air during a leap, and controls during a pirouette is incredible. Its as effective a depiction of dance as I’ve ever seen in our medium. Likewise, her body language tells a story in and of itself, especially when she cowers in fear in the presence of The Monster. That fear is unjustified, though, because there is no death in Bound, and there’s no punishment for platforming failure other than a quick respawn to the site of the incident. The platforming isn’t necessarily tricky or creative, but ledges can be narrow and the collision detection is a bit spotty, so I found myself falling every so often. But like Journey and Abzu, I really don’t mind that lack of friction. The joy I got from Bound came from its unique mechanics and its visually fantastic worlds.   Bound also did a great job of making me want to replay its three-hour story by offering up different experiences depending on the order you play the levels in. The stages themselves are bite-sized – each one can be completed in 15 minutes or so. But each one culminates in your character getting over a specific fear which manifests itself throughout the levels as things like paper airplanes and squid-like tentacles. If you enter a world rife with paper planes after you’ve already conquered that fear, then you can easily get past these obstacles and unlock different paths throughout the world. That said, I never really felt a sense of “place” to the spaces I was exploring. Maybe that’s the point, given the surreal and obtuse nature of Bound’s setting, but I was disappointed by the lack of cohesion in the world compared to platformers like Super Mario 64 or emotional adventures like Journey. Even having played through twice, I couldn’t really map out any of the stages from memory. Despite being a relatively-simple 3D platformer, Bound’s fantastic sense of movement and strange, dream-like world make it utterly unique. It’s a testament to phenomenal controls and sense of grace that I was able to set aside the camera and design flaws, and fully immerse myself in this strange, beautiful story.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	 Abzu creates one of the most relaxing, stress-free underwater experiences I’ve ever played. By emphasizing freedom of movement over survival, it gave me all the time I needed to soak in its gorgeous art direction, marvel at its fluid controls, and listen to its epic orchestral score. During the course of this fascinating three-hour adventure full of deep-sea mysteries and discoveries, its moving melodies ebbed and flowed with my emotions and fueled my curiosity to reach the finale, even when the story lacked context. What you actually do along the way is a little light on gameplay, but it’s still a spectacular journey worth taking.    Each area shows off Abzu’s fantastic art direction and attention to detail. Abzu’s intriguing underwater world is presented with little introduction – you’re a mysterious diver who awakens and begins to explore – but it generates enough mystery to propel you through a series of stunning locations. From seaweed swaying in the current to mysterious sunken shrines, each area shows off Abzu’s fantastic art direction, attention to detail, and an impressive sense of scale as you swim through enormous chasms under the sea. This journey feels remarkable because of the way it constantly dangles the next intriguing area in front of you. I found myself traveling through its underwater rabbit hole into a strange, unfamiliar world full of cryptic iconography and ambient life such as fish, turtles, and whales. I was constantly wondering what I would find around the next bend, and each new area I discovered kept the surprises coming with fantastic architecture and some incredibly large spaces to swim in. And while nothing (including some intimidatingly large sharks) wants to actually eat you, it’s still a fish-eat-fish world down here, and you can observe the convincingly recreated circle of life by meditating at a shark statue if you want.   Continuing on my journey I slowly waded into ancient ruins or completely lit-up, cathedral-like structures, and enjoyed the leisurely pace. In certain places it speeds up, and high-speed channels function like highways that pick up the pace and push you into beautiful new territory. One of the more memorable speedways had me swimming alongside a pod of incredibly large whales. It made me feel like a small fish in a very large pool. Even during the most spectacular moments the framerate was almost always consistent at 30 per second despite the density of life on screen. I noticed it slow down slightly a handful of times, like when ultra dense schools of fish would swim in a tight loop.  The rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. Abzu’s journey into the deep is conveyed primarily through pretty graphics, but its rousing, evocative musical score really steals the show. Each new area you explore is bookended by music from Journey composer Austin Wintory, and his contributions sound absolutely wonderful. The stirring ensemble of strings and flutes bounces back and forth between soothing tunes and rousing orchestral melodies that stayed with me hours after I put down the controller. The orchestrations are carefully used to punctuate emotional moments in a way that I’ve seen few games do, with the tempo rising and melting away into the background appropriately. And whenever the music dissipated, the ambient sounds of the sea served as a constant reminder that I was mostly alone in this world. It all makes Abzu the closest thing to a playable version of Disney’s Fantasia that I’ve seen produced by a video game.   But what are we actually doing here, other than taking in the sights and sounds? Abzu never makes that clear, either from a story perspective or with gameplay depth. I did enjoy my time swimming from the start because simple controls make is easy for almost anyone to pick up and enjoy moving around. Abzu uses a familiar control setup that resembles a driving game: holding the R2 button dives deeper and constantly moves you forward. You can boost to push through through areas quickly. Within minutes I could effortlessly maneuver in the water, do loop-the-loops, or break through to the surface and pull off a quick mid-air trick like a dolphin. And what limited interactions there are with the environment focus on helping you get around: you can grab onto fish when you want to move faster or slower.  Abzu's simple puzzle are designed to keep you moving ahead. It’s just a little disappointing that Abzu’s smooth movement isn’t really put to the test by any form of challenge, like a race through the environment. You avoid a few hazards, but that’s about it. Nasty underwater landmines are the only attacker you encounter, and outside of a worrisome warning bell when you get close their scary zaps are nothing more than a momentary hinderance. Abzu has some puzzles, too, but they’re little more than quick flip switches that don’t require a ton of thought. They’re only meant to open up the next breathtaking location and keep pushing you forward.   The mystery Abzu presents at the start is intriguing, but the end of story is a little too abstract – even relative to other wordless storytelling adventures like Journey. There are a few cutscenes, but it mostly leans on environmental storytelling to fill in the gaps of what happened to an ancient, alien-looking civilization we find here. But what happened and why were very unclear, and on my first time through there wasn’t enough context to give the ending the power it seemed to aim for. I couldn’t quite place what Abzu wanted me to feel, so it just left me puzzled because I wasn’t entirely sure what had happened. But considering the entire thing is just three hours long, it’s short enough that I didn’t mind diving back in for another swim through to piece together the story, which revealed significantly more meaning now that I knew what to look for. Abzu takes the graceful feel of movement and subtle push toward discovery that I’ve enjoyed in similar exploration games like Journey and Flower and builds a refreshing-yet-simple underwater adventure around it. The colorful settings, beautiful soundtrack, and basic controls made it a great experience that constantly piqued my interest, even if it never challenged me to master it other than deciphering its cryptic environmental clues. Instead, Abzu relishes in giving you freedom to simply enjoy exploring the fascinating deep blue sea.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	 On paper, Headlander shouldn’t work. With both its clashing tone and humor and its mishmash of 2D mechanics, it successfully blends ideas that aren’t just different—they’re about as dissimilar as possible. It comes together thanks to great retro art, fun exploration, and developer Double Fine’s unmistakable charm. This is a game that explores humanity and our overreliance on technology, and what it means to be alive. It’s also about a mustachioed, rocket-powered head (with amnesia) and tiny vacuum robots that giggle when they fart out dust. When it’s not a classic, slower-paced Metroidvania-style adventure, it’s a twitchy bullet hell shooter with enough speed to make your palms sweat It’s a lot to take in.  Picture BioShock in bellbottoms—less seaweed, more shag carpet. That’s the groovy, dystopian world of Headlander in a nutshell, and its wonderful style makes the ‘70s sci-fi space station a joy to explore. In this place, humans have transferred their minds into robots and abandoned their flesh-and-blood bodies, conquering Injury, disease, and even death. But in a twist that should surprise no one, an evil AI has implanted everyone with dampener chips to keep them in line. They’ll be happy, but never overjoyed. They’ll have questions, but they won’t think too hard about the answers. Though the world feels original, the premise isn’t, and Headlander is wise not to linger on it.  The liberal use of cheesy robot voice filters fits the fiction well. Instead, it lets you experience the aftermath: a crowded, bustling world of complacent simpletons, living their eerie half-lives. The writing is sparse, and voice lines are repeated too often, but Headlander finds success with the less-is-more approach. For example, while exploring a place called the Pleasure Port, I found a room where robo-people pay to rub their metal bodies against a swath of shag carpet to stimulate their sensors. As everyone hummed and rolled, I approached a guy standing in the corner. “It’s like a meadow of grass,” he said. Then, in a sad but hopeful tone: “Do you remember grass?” It’s genuine and naive. Across the board the voice acting is solid, and the liberal use of cheesy robot voice filters fits the fiction well.  The fiction also gives us Headlander’s main mechanic (and namesake), which is that at any time you can detach your head from whatever body you’ve commandeered and fly around. In this mode you’re smaller and faster, but your ability to deal damage disappears and you can’t open doors or use warp pads. While floating, you can use a vacuum ability to yank the heads off any robots you find and, if you’d like, attach your own head to the headless body. Both the grounded heft of a body and the weightless glide of your head are smooth and responsive; it doesn’t feel like either was treated as a primary mechanic over the other.  Sometimes your head becomes a veritable spaceship in a bullet hell game. At first it all feels too simple: use bodies to fight, use your head to explore, and that’s that. However, the mechanic quickly deepens as enemy types grow stronger, environments become more complex, and your skill tree fills up. In more intense situations you’ll dodge lasers and hop from body to body, using them just until their health bars deplete and then discarding them. If there are too many guns firing you can maneuver your head around, dashing and weaving to dodge shots and get close enough to yank off enemies’ heads to render them inert. Sometimes you’re forced into small spaces, and your head becomes a veritable spaceship in a bullet hell game. It’s all furious and fun, with a fair difficulty curve that ensures a challenge but keeps frustration to a minimum.  Your upgrade tree is packed with goodies ranging from 100% crucial to fun but nearly useless. Unless you’re an actual video game wizard, I don’t know how you could forego regenerating health, body armor, and the ability to project two shields around your head instead of one. Because they’re so vital to surviving and exploring, buying most skills feels empowering and rewarding, and that loop encouraged me to explore every corner to find hidden XP stockpiles. Headlander is generous with its power-up orbs as well, so I never felt cheated or underleveled.  When you need a green robot, it usually spawns far away from the green door. On the other hand, because of the way navigation works some of the cooler upgrades felt too situational to be nearly as useful. For example, the biggest part of the challenge throughout Headlander is that the sprawling world is filled with colored gates; to open a gate you must be in control of a body that matches the gate’s color. (If you’re not worthy, the doors will taunt you with silly puns or lines like “The other side of this door is AMAAAAZING!”) The hierarchy, from common to rare (also weak to powerful), follows the rainbow: Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Violet (sorry Indigo), and any higher-level color can open a door of any lower color. However, when you need a green robot, it usually spawns far away from the green door, forcing you to protect and preserve its body as you fight to your objective.  Conflictingly, a good number of your more fun upgrades encourage you put your frame in harm’s way or leave it behind. One lets you use a body as a self-destructing bomb. Another lets you abandon the body while it automatically fires in one direction like a sentry. Another lets you headbutt an enemy, swapping heads in the process. They’re all cool, fun, and satisfying to use, but putting your rare-colored body at risk is almost never a good idea—especially later in the campaign. Lasers you and your enemies fire ricochet off walls two or three times, and many bots fire several lasers at a time. The screen quickly becomes a bright, laser-filled deathtrap, and collateral damage to your precious, immobile body is nearly inevitable if you’re not there to steer it clear. When it really mattered, I was almost always better off using cover and picking my battles. It’s a shame that some of the flashier moves just aren’t viable. While not inaccurate to call Headlander a Metroidvania because of the way new abilities allow you to access new parts of an otherwise open map, it plays more like a series of smaller Metroidvania-ish levels rather than one massive map. Hidden rooms with upgrades are mostly easy to find and access with minimal head scratching, and once I was done with a certain zone (usually tied to a specific story event) there wasn’t a huge incentive for me to go back. By the end of the eight hour campaign, with semi-diligent searching, I had every ability node unlocked and well over half of the generic health, power, and thrust upgrades. Completionists have a chance to go back and explore the world after the credits roll, but thankfully, Headlander doesn’t punish you for happily matching its momentum. Headlander is an unexpectedly great take on Metroidviania-style action. Some of the objective design renders its flashier, body-endangering powers moot, but the quick and complex moment-to-moment gameplay carries it splendidly. It’s difficult but fair, and fast-paced but satisfying through to the end. And with a story so dangerously loaded with trope upon trope, it’s a joy to see Headlander sidestep some cliches with a beautiful setting, dark humor, and, well… a rocket-powered head. That’ll do the trick.
Seth Macy	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	" Kerbal Space Program is the most fun I've ever had failing. And man oh man, did I fail – over and over again. It's part of Kerbal's experimental nature. By the time I finally built a rocket that achieved successful orbit I had failed so many times that in almost any other game I would have given up completely. But that's where the genius of Kerbal really is: hard work pays off, and once I was able to determine the cause of my failures, be it staging woes or my nose pitching violently at 1000 meters, every successful launch was a thing of beauty. Kerbal on PlayStation 4 is for the most part exactly the same as its PC counterpart (read our Kerbal Space Program PC review), with the big exception of the control scheme. I found it daunting at first glance: there's a lot going on in every single screen, and accessing the in-game help files did nothing to put me at ease. To accommodate Kerbal’s made-for-mouse-and-keyboard complexity, Certain buttons on the controller behave as modifiers that, when held down, give each of the other buttons different functions. It sounds like a hot mess, but I was amazed at how quickly I was able to figure the controls out without a cheat-sheet in front of me. The button assignments have a really intuitive feel... although I often accidentally hit X during EVAs, causing my Kerbal to let go of its module and float helplessly into space. So human error is a factor.  In its Career and Science modes, Kerbal Space Program creates an incredible sense of accomplishment with each successful feat of rocketry. Through hours of trial and error, I finally came to a design and flight technique that did what I wanted it to, and it was fantastically satisfying because each accomplishment is just a step toward bigger and better things. Every success (such as reaching a new record altitude) is really just a place to start over, only with better stuff. It's a lovely feedback loop that I can't get enough of.  Striking the perfect balance between thrust, weight, and fuel made me feel brilliant. I spent the majority of my time in Career mode, where all the challenges that come with actually blasting an object into space come into play. Balancing funding, scientific progression, and reputation forced me to put thought into each launch, and the limited selection of spaceship parts made me think hard about how I could get the most from each rocket engine, fuel supply, or science module. Going higher requires more thrust, which requires bigger engines. Bigger engines require more fuel, which make the ship heavier. A heavier ship needs more thrust to go higher, which requires more engines. And so on. Striking the perfect balance between thrust, weight, and fuel with only the parts and funds unlocked in Career mode made me feel like a brilliant rocket scientist. I enjoyed Science mode less. It retains the tech tree progression of Career mode, but removes other restrictions so the stakes aren't as high. Without the goals of Career mode, though, I'd rather be playing Sandbox, where everything is unlocked and my imagination is the only limit. When I'd get to a point in Career where I was having trouble progressing and started to get frustrated, I'd switch to Sandbox and build to my heart's content. Sandbox allows for truly ridiculous designs - the sort of insane, utterly impractical rockets I built just to see how far I could push Kerbal’s physics. Leaving the symmetry option turned up to its highest setting, I quickly built an excessively powerful pinwheeling rocket. I didn't design it for science, or for speed, or to see how far I could make it fly; I built the thing just because I could. When I took it to the launch pad and set it off and it didn't immediately explode, there was a brief second just before the whole thing failed violently where I thought, ""Hey, maybe I'm onto something here."" It was a glorious second.  Unfortunately, Kerbal Space Program suffers from occasional framerate stutters, which become more frequent and severe the more complicated your builds and missions become. Even leaving the atmosphere during the earliest hours with a simple engine/command pod/parachute design causes some hiccups. And as fun as Sandbox mode is, it's also where I ran into my biggest issues with framerate. Given the total freedom to build meant my designs became increasingly ridiculous and complex, and all those engines and moving parts slowed the framerate way, way down. At times, when I really pushed it, it dipped below 10 frames per second. For the most part, these are avoidable by reigning in your creativity just a bit.  When things go wrong, Kerbal makes getting it right easy. But when things go wrong, either from overdoing it or simply discovering your crazy idea for an unconventional spaceship wasn’t quite crazy enough to work, Kerbal makes getting it right easy. If you don't like the way a launch went, you can just revert back to the launchpad with no penalty. If my design was clearly a failure, I could revert right back to construction. Quick and fun experimentation is the name of the game. Getting off the ground is only the first small step for Kerbal kind. After finally landing on a design that got me into space, turning a vertical trajectory into an orbital one presented new challenges. Once I mastered orbit, I set my sites to the moon (or,a s Kerbals call it, Mun). The tutorials were a big help in explaining orbital mechanics, which are all very science-y and absolutely need to be understood if you're going to make it to any of the numerous celestial bodies in the Kerbal solar system. This is where the challenge, and experimentation, become almost limitless. I almost felt bad blowing up so many brave little Kerbals in my pursuit of the stars. With their self-assured mannerisms, they work so well to lighten the mood while learning rocket science. Kerbal Space Program doesn't have any voice acting, other than the occasional nasally whine of approval from one of the Kerbals, but the flavor text is smart, wry, and funny. Kerbal Space Program does the improbable: it makes learning a complex subject fun. Its cute, clueless characters and sense of humor turn a hardcore physics simulator into something replayable and addictive, and well worth getting over the hurdle of learning the controls. Designing, flying, and then retrying missions again and again is a tough challenge that goes right up to the brink of frustration (and sometimes beyond the limits of the PlayStation 4’s performance), but the eventual success of achieving virtual space flight is rewarding and even inspirational."
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	 Back in the late ‘90s, Carmageddon’s open-world, pedestrian-squashing racing mechanics were fresh, exciting, and hilarious. And to its credit, the new Carmageddon: Max Damage recreates the feel, structure, and sense of humor of the original two games in the series quite well. Unfortunately, like the recent lukewarm Beavis & Butt-Head return on MTV, time has moved on, and Carmageddon hasn’t aged well. In short, Carmageddon’s late-’90s sensibilities fail it in 2016. Every free-roam map is enormous – a revelation in 1997, but a dull chore now. Driving across the giant areas is either boring or frustrating, especially on some of the poorly-designed maps that require difficult indoor navigation. And because the objective you’re driving toward is often randomly spawned around these huge maps, they’re frequently lost before you even have a chance to compete for them because someone else happened to be closer. You’ll spend many wasted minutes chasing a target, only to have an AI rival beat you to it and then have the next objective spawn way back where you had just come from. As such, events simply take far too long, ranging from 10 to 30 (!) minutes each.  Those events play out in progressively unlocked fashion in the career mode, which escorts you through various stages across different locales. Some are straight races, in which case plowing your spike-loaded vehicle through pedestrians has little payoff (which seems contrary to the theme of over-the-top vehicular homicide); others are sprints to random checkpoints; another more appropriately bloodthirsty mode has everyone racing to kill the same marked pedestrian first. The best of the challenges, though, is a race that lets you win by either hitting all of the checkpoints first, wiping out all rival racers first, or running over every pedestrian on the map first, because then you at least have a bit of choice and variety to help keep things interesting. But one interesting mode does not a robust game make. Adding insult to injury, every event is preceded by a painful loading time that lasts a bit over one minute as well – which is baffling considering these graphics are decidedly last-gen, particularly on the indoor “Storage Vats” course. As you’d expect the accompanying speed-metal soundtrack is grating, and not in a good way, though it can mercifully be turned off in the options menu so you can enjoy the sound of crunching metal in peace.  A much-needed strong point is the selection of cars, which is impressively diverse. We get to take our pick from hot rods to monster trucks to my favorite, the DeLorean, aka the “Degoryun” – complete with openable gull-wing doors you can use to whack pedestrians in the head with. I wish their floaty handling were tighter, but when you land a big hit on a foe, it explodes them in a highly satisfying ball of fiery death. The car-on-car violence is made even crunchier by some great random power-ups, which run the gamut from “pelvic thrusts” that launch enemy cars away from you to an anvil launcher that does exactly what you think it does. There’s an element of danger in picking them up, too, as some can actually negatively affect you. As for the intangibles, don’t worry – despite the fact that you’re actively rewarded with points and/or extra race time for splattering citizens in its dystopian future world, Carmageddon’s tongue is wedged firmly in cheek in the humor department. Its cartoonish violence is clearly not to be taken seriously. The jokes are intentionally low-brow, with the f-word and sex-joke puns thrown about liberally. But what once were belly laughs in the time before games like Saints Row The Third set a new high bar for crude humor are now chuckles (though plowing into a cow wearing a radiation suit on an Area 51-ish stage is pretty damn funny). Likewise, what were once impressive new gameplay mechanics and sprawling maps are now painfully aged. Carmageddon: Max Damage feels like it was designed in and for the year 1999, which on paper is a noble goal when trying to revive a franchise. Unfortunately, in practice it just doesn’t work, instead reminding us that time moves on. Max Damage is a collection of ideas that looked good on paper and sounded good in its Kickstarter pitch, but in practice it would only have been an acceptable sequel if it’d come out in 1999.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	 When’s the last time you remember playing a game with good underwater controls? Ecco the Dolphin, maybe? It’s incredibly rare that a game gets the appropriately floaty feel of aquatic movement right, and thus frustrating underwater sections are a common problem that dates all the way back to the original Super Mario Bros. And despite taking place entirely underwater, Insomniac’s Song of the Deep’s clunky submarine controls exacerbate its repetitive puzzles, and together they drown out its serene and beautiful Metroidvania-style retelling of a fantastical Irish fairy tale. A painterly look and melancholy Celtic music are every bit as effective and enjoyable in the opening minutes as they are at the end of the eight-hour adventure. Characters, backgrounds, and animations remind me like a cross between Child of Light and Ori and the Blind Forest in a really beautiful way. There are some slight performance hiccups, specifically when you cross a save point, but it was nothing major enough to harm the overall style.   Going deeper and deeper into the ocean in your submarine and seeing the strange mythological beasts that reside there continually drove me forward in eager anticipation of what new locale or creature would appear next. From the ruins of ancient forgotten kingdoms, to the spooky nest of a giant spider beast, the inter-connected world is full of interesting places to explore. This ties in well with its Metroidvania roots -- unlocking new abilities like being able to leave the sub and swim through tiny doorways made me always want to retrace my steps and see what new secrets they could unlock. And this exploration pays off in the form of giving you experience to level up.  ...the inter-connected world is full of interesting places to explore. In the early hours, Song of the Deep does a good job of giving you the option to grow your submarine and character how you see fit. You can reap the benefits to exploration, jet across the ocean floor with speed and mobility, or fortify your weapons to be able to tackle even the biggest enemies. Having to weigh the pros and cons of how I spend my XP provided some genuinely tough decisions. However, there aren’t enough abilities to keep that going in the second half, and I ended the adventure with a nearly maxed-out, homogenized character.   But as I said, having played from beginning to end, I never grew to enjoy how the act of movement feels in Song of the Deep. When mobs of enemies surround you, some of them firing projectiles while others surround themselves in a harmful electric barrier, you need tight controls and precise shooting to make it out alive, and here the submarine feels too sluggish in acceleration to avoid enemies that seem to be operating under different rules. Some can even pass through level geometry. I never quite felt the same level of prowess as I do in any of the great land-based platformers, which led to a solid amount of deaths that left me feeling like they weren’t entirely my fault. Checkpoints are plentiful, so it never set my progress back too far, but it was still a frustration.  ...the controls are especially problematic when it comes to puzzles. However, the controls are especially problematic when it comes to puzzles. While the puzzles are fun to mentally figure out, they become a slog to physically finish. Having to quickly move keys from one place to another using your grappling hook or open a timing-based door and trying to slip through before it closes is all made more frustrating thanks to the fact that I never felt fully comfortable maneuvering my character or her submarine through the world. Song of the Deep makes a fantastic first impression. Its gorgeous world, charming characters, and melancholy tone make for a unique and effective aesthetic. But once you get into the core of the mechanics, combat and puzzles become a slog thanks to its cumbersome controls and wonky physics. Still, I found myself willing to put up with all of these frustrations in order to delve deeper and deeper into this beautiful world.
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	" The key moment of Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness happens about an hour in, when a hulking spaceship roars out of the skies and crashes near a spot where the world's fantasy-themed locals are hacking at each other with slabs of steel. It's a powerful, Columbus-style moment; a clash of technology and world views. It's also an unfortunate metaphor for Integrity and Faithlessness itself, as virtually every good idea this uncharacteristically brief JRPG brings up finds itself clashing with the complications of a poorer one. Sadly for those of us who've held out hope in the seven years since Star Ocean: The Last Hope, it's a struggle that never really resolves itself. Take the fantasy-meets-sci-fi premise: It's one I admire greatly, being a fan of writers like Gene Wolfe, Mark Lawrence, and Joe Abercrombie. There was fertile ground for a great story here, and it even had the advantage of being filled with likable characters like Fidel, a young swordsman who gets caught up in an interstellar war after seeking aid for his besieged village; or Emmerson, a captain from space who roleplays a crossbowman out of honor for his government's Prime Directive of sorts. I'll even admit a fondness for Fiore, the supercilious sorceress whose greatest magical feat appears to be her ability to keep her porous getup from ever slipping out of place.  A pity, then, that the plot quickly falls into a pit of tired clichés, particularly after Fidel and his childhood friend Miki start hunting for the parents of a mysterious young girl who escaped from the fallen spacecraft. (She also has amnesia, because of course she does!) Space remains distant — regardless of the series' title, this is a decidedly earthbound adventure, with the few jaunts to space and back lasting only a little longer than a round-trip flight for a SpaceX rocket.   Other signs of trouble reveal themselves early on, such as the relative absence of many traditional cutscenes in favor of voiced dialogue between characters as they stand around looking at each other in the normal gameplay perspective. Seeing expressions thus requires that Fidel moves around to look at their faces, and the approach lacks the emotional punch traditional Star Ocean cutscenes sometimes deliver. The design also fosters awkward silences when a character performs an action I may not initially see on my screen, thus leading me to realize the ""cutscene"" is still in play only when a red line pops up to bar my path. Integrity and Faithlessness employs this tactic relentlessly and excessively, and it did much to drain my interest in bothering with optional events in towns that flesh out the backstories of my companions. So much of the 20-or-so-hour campaign consists of jogging back and forth through the same seven or so predictable maps.  Even the art design clashes with itself. Decent costume designs (which unfortunately rarely change, even with new gear) clash with character faces that hail from deep in the uncanny valley. (No wonder Integrity and Faithlessness avoids cutscenes so much.) The world they inhabit fares much worse: at their best, some outdoor regions look nice in a last-gen kind of way — sort of like how The Witcher 3 might look with my contacts out — while other parts look as though they could be Minecraft creations viewed from afar. It's not an insignificant criticism: so much of Integrity and Faithlessness’ 20-or-so-hour campaign consists of jogging back and forth through the same seven or so predictable maps with cliffs and mountains, and thus only rarely does the eye candy sweeten the experience. The big saving grace, though, is Motoi Sakuraba's fantastic soundtrack.  Combat, too, suffers from this clash between good ideas and poor implementation. The brawling in Integrity and Faithlessness generally takes place in real time save for pauses for greater precision, and initially there's a lot of arcadey fun at hand while hacking and slashing away with Fidel and a few of his allies. In theory, one of the best things about this game is that seven characters can be in your party at once, and with a tap of the DualShock's shoulder bumpers you can switch between all of them as you please, firing Emmerson's crossbow in one moment and unleashing a fireball from Miki the next. As the party grows, though, it becomes clear that seven is a lot of people to keep track of in real time. Everyone and everything gets lost in the flash and bang of spells exploding and swords slashing during each battle, for one, which makes it almost impossible to pull off the rock-paper-scissors system of countering that’s so vaunted by the opening tutorial. (I eventually found that just spamming Fidel's debilitating heavy attacks usually yielded a surer path to victory.) Leveling allows you to assign up to four roles for each character to give them some kind of AI direction, but the option helps only minimally in practice. Without me taking control of them, my team members seemed dead set on attacking whoever they wanted to attack and staring off at distant clouds instead of blasting bug monsters with fireballs, ""Defensive"" or ""Healing"" roles be damned. This was maddening enough when I was fighting two-bit succubi in one of the many backtracks from one city to the next. Later, when Integrity and Faithlessness started peppering its story with boss fights that required me to protect a single character, it led me to desk-slamming depths of rage. No matter how much I tinkered with the roles and skills beforehand, the enemies invariably rushed the targeted character and the fight would end within seconds. Cue a minute-long unskippable cutscene before I could try again. Cue more anger. The only thing that got me through it was a ""Reserve Rush"" system that builds up heavy heals or devastating attacks for an entire party over time – but only if I'd built it up enough before the fight. Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness is an RPG that merely fulfills its obligations. It's not awful thanks to a cast of likeable characters and an interesting premise, but an abundance of clichés, uneven polish, and messy combat and AI make it less than memorable. And as its main story only provides around 20 hours of playtime instead of the 60 or more the series usually delivers, some of those obligations aren’t met in full. As for me, I can't say I regret my time with Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithlessness, but 20 hours was enough."
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/24/umbrella-corps-review	 Perhaps to avoid damaging the still-beloved horror series’ brand, the clumsy multiplayer shooter Umbrella Corps doesn’t carry the Resident Evil name even though it takes place in the same universe. Its movements feel sluggish, its combat is mindless and predictable, and its lack of personality ensures it’s just another rotting face in the crowd. The few times Umbrella Corps brings good ideas to the table, it kills them with such efficiency that it almost feels intentional. I can’t recall another recent game that feels as lost and confused as this one. So much about Umbrella Corps makes no sense. For starters, this is a cover-based shooter with cover that doesn’t matter, and can even be a disadvantage. In addition to enemy players, multiplayer maps are dense with zombies that attack anything nearby. You know what’s easy prey for the ravenous undead? A soldier tucked behind a wall or into a corner. By default, players are equipped with a jamming device that keeps zombies at bay, but it’s very easily disrupted or shot off by enemies. Sitting in cover for more than a few seconds is akin to basting your face in barbecue sauce.  Additionally, standing and running around rarely feels like the best idea. In most games, you pay for the smaller target profile of a person lying on the ground with a severe movement penalty, but in Umbrella Corps crouched players move almost as quickly as standing players, and even prone characters are relatively fast. I played a few matches entirely from the prone position (I affectionately call it “Worm Mode”) and was able to kill enemies and avoid zombies with few drawbacks.  Finishing off a kill feels more like a chore than a hunt. Firefights feel a lot more like the damage-absorbent Halo than the three-kills-per-clip style of Call of Duty, as far time-to-kill goes. The difference between this and Halo is that in Umbrella Corps characters feel clunky to control. Aiming down your sights in first-person mode hits your already shambling character with a significant movement penalty. Combined with characters that can eat far too many bullets, finishing off a kill feels more like a chore than a hunt. Guns also take far too long to reload, meaning if your aim isn’t excellent, you’ll have to stop shooting to reload before you pursue. This wouldn’t be a problem if your poor movement and weak weapons weren’t already working against you. After a few matches, I went into the customization menu to equip a new decal on my character’s helmet. I couldn’t help but laugh at one that said, “100 Shot 1 Kill!!”  One thing Umbrella Corps gets right is the pace at which it gives you new guns, attachments, armor variants, colors, and other customization items. You level up quickly, and the string of new toys would be a strong incentive to jump right into your next match if this were a better game. Some of the armor sets look cool, if a bit generic, but the flashy, high-level rewards, like the Soviet-style mask or the night assault gear, are tantalizing. However, this system is made almost entirely irrelevant by the Brainer.  It’s not difficult to run up to an enemy while under fire and initiate its finishing move. The Brainer, according to Capcom’s description, is “a powerful melee ax which goes straight into the skull.” It’s equipped for free on every player, and its benefits are simply too good to ignore. You move quickly while wielding it, and it has a one-hit-kill charge-up attack with an extremely generous lock-on range. And because players are bullet sponges, it’s not difficult to run up to an enemy while under fire and initiate its finishing move. In any given match, about half of the players (if not more) will be running around with the Brainer, braining away. Why be excited for new gear when you already have the best weapon? It’s what you’d call a no-brainer.  Resident Evil’s influence is mostly seen in Umbrella Corps’ maps. Series fans will be familiar with Umbrella’s facility, Tricell’s HQ, and the village from Resident Evil 4. The levels are detailed and look great at times, but they all share one big problem: they’re too cramped. Umbrella Corps’ 3v3 matches means there’s never a large number of players, but when filled with dozens of mindless, roaming zombies things get claustrophobic in a hurry. Another side effect of the map size is that unfair spawns happen too often to excuse. Dying a second after you spawn is no fun, and if you’re playing the mode where one player is marked as a priority target for the enemy team, it quickly turns from an annoying issue into a game-losing problem.  This is the only mode that uses the random zombies in a way that matters. One mode, in which you must kill zombies and collect more DNA vials than the other team, is Umbrella Corps’ biggest success. This is not a unique idea -- it’s much like Call of Duty’s Kill Confirmed mode -- but it’s the only mode that uses the random zombies in a way that matters. Your guns can mow down zombies in no time, but they’re also loud, and that noise alerts other players to your presence and makes you an easy target. Worse, if you just killed a pack of the undead and didn’t yet move over to their bodies to collect the vials, an enemy could kill you and claim the DNA as well. Using silent melee attacks is obviously a stealthier approach, but it tends to be slower than using your guns. With the clock constantly counting down, I enjoyed switching between tactics to give my team an edge.  The other modes are standard fare: kill the enemies, defend the point, collect the briefcases. They aren’t necessarily bad, just uninspired, and they don’t make smart use of the zombies at all. With that potentially unique element stripped away, you’re left with average shooter modes in a below-average shooter. Umbrella Corps has a single-player mode called The Experiment, but it’s too shallow to hold your attention for long. Across these 20+ levels, you have to complete mission objectives with only one life. If you die, you have to restart. There is a tension present here that isn’t found in most of the multiplayer modes, as getting overwhelmed by zombies is a real problem. However, the mood is too often defused because zombies drop so many healing herbs. It’s here that Umbrella Corps once again defeats itself. With healing so plentiful, The Experiment doesn’t feel as tense or as challenging as it should. The end result just doesn’t work. Umbrella Corps is a bad competitive shooter that doesn’t even know how to take advantage of its few strengths. Its mechanics frequently contradict each other, balance is absurd, controls are clumsy, and it fails to pull anything meaningful from the Resident Evil universe other than some recognizable settings. With no great story hooks for horror fans and mechanics that can’t compare to most modern shooters, Umbrella Corps feels like a game made for no one.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/20/mighty-no-9-review	" It pains me to say as a die-hard Mega Man fan, but Mighty No. 9 lacks the spark of magic and sense of rhythm necessary to make a fun action-platformer, let alone a spiritual successor to one of the most beloved examples of the genre. Its flat, lifeless art style lacks in both fidelity and character, and while it has some novel gameplay ideas, they’re never fleshed out or executed well enough to elevate it past its basement-level production values. Right from the get-go, it’s pretty clear something is amiss with Mighty No. 9. Its sickly color palette and flat lighting don't exactly help its generic, Saturday-morning cartoon art style. How a game can look this underwhelming and still have noticeable framerate issues in 2016 is simply beyond me, but here we are. It's mostly limited to specific parts of certain stages, and it never led to any deaths I wasn't already headed for, but it's still an eyesore for a game whose graphics weren't doing it any favors in the first place.  Despite how homely looking I found it, I did see potential in Mighty No. 9's gameplay ideas in the early going of its three to five-hour campaign. After all, while the idea of stealing bosses abilities isn't as ground-breaking today as it was in the 80s, it's still a pretty enjoyable concept, but sadly, none of them feel all that fun to use. Absorbing and using these powers should feel exciting, like turning on a cheat code that grants powers you shouldn’t have, but most of them wind up being borderline useless, and the level design rarely provides a context in which they can be truly useful.   I did identify one or two that became bedrocks for me though. Mighty No. 7’s blades, for instance, were particularly useful for reflecting incoming fire and dealing tons of damage up close. Sadly, Mighty No. 9’s more unorthodox and potentially interesting abilities wind up being the most underwhelming. Mighty No 3’s electrodes and No. 4’s tank treads both seemed cool in concept, but in most situations they felt clumsy compared to protagonist Beck’s standard blaster. I almost always felt like I could cut through any area quicker, and more efficiently without using the fancy stuff - not really how you want ""special"" abilities to feel. I almost always felt like I could cut through any area quicker, and more efficiently without using the fancy stuff.  This held doubly true for boss battles; yes, in true Mega Man style you'll find there's one weapon that works particularly well against any given boss, but if I didn't have it, I never had any difficulty plowing through with ye olde standard blaster. This undermines a key part of the Mega Man formula that Mighty No. 9 intends to ape: the strategy of choosing which bosses to fight when. Since I can easily down any boss without hitting-their-weak-spot-for-massive-damage it really never mattered what order I tackled them in. Since the levels and bosses failed to challenge me in ways that demanded the use of these abilities, they ended up feeling superfluous.  Only Mighty No. 2’s Cryosphere felt vital in any way, due in large part to how much more energy efficient it is compared to the other options. But it also plays a vital role in synergizing with Mighty No. 9’s other big mechanic: Beck’s enemy-assimilating dash. Damaging enemies enough destabilizes them instead of killing them, so to finish them off, you have to dash through them, collecting a temporary power-up in the process. Absorbing them immediately after destabilizing them (signaled by a 100% ""absorption rate) starts building a combo multiplier, which goes up and up as long as you keep getting 100% absorption rates on subsequent foes. On the surface, it's a neat system that encourages speed and proper spacing between you and your foes. However, hitting enemies with Cryosphere widens the window of time in which you can get a perfect absorption rate to the point where it may as well be forever, which allowed me to rack up huge combos with ease. This made it the obvious choice in most situations, and since you get it very early on, it preemptively renders all subsequent abilities obsolete. The optimal way to play is essentially presented in the second level, which kills most of the challenge, along with the desire to learn and improve.   It's too bad, because I really like the idea of using timed dashes to finish enemies while continuing to advance, and there were certainly times when I slipped into a pleasing cadence of shooting and dashing, covering large stretches of a level in seconds. Like Mighty No. 9's other interesting wrinkles though. this too is undermined. Since there's no limitation of any kind on the number of air dashes you can take, and virtually no cooldown, Beck is essentially capable of a limited form of flight, trivializing any platforming challenges thrown at you. The other problem is that while doing things optimally isn't terribly hard in Mighty No. 9, when you don't absolutely nail it, some levels devolve into slow, tedious slogs. If you move through quickly enough to retain the necessary power-ups to plow through a section, it’s over in two blinks of an eye. Get there a few seconds later, though, and you’ll be stuck waiting for slow-moving platforms and fighting enemies whose job seems to be more to annoy you or get in your way rather than to kill you. In many ways, it’s a punishment worse than death. I’d rather take my lumps for my mistakes right away and start over than have to stumble through a few minutes of tedium. Despite its pedigree, Mighty No. 9 doesn’t seem to have a good sense of what was fun about Mega Man, or 2D action-platformers in general. There are brief moments where its pieces come together, but even then it’s hamstrung by its visually joyless art and animation. The soul of the Blue Bomber just isn’t here, and worse yet there’s no endearing personality of its own, and as a result, Mighty No. 9 feels much more like a second-rate imposter than a spiritual successor."
John Robertson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/17/sherlock-holmes-the-devils-daughter-review	 For all it struggles and strains, Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter ultimately fails to make you feel like the titular English detective. The script might be intriguing and the voice acting passable, the graphics detailed and the range of activities diverse, but it's a game that can never quite decide whether it wants to give us control or have us sit back and watch a story unfold. This internal struggle, as well as some technical ones, end up making gameplay frustrating and dull. Even more crucially, it undermines the character of Sherlock himself. Whether reading about his adventures, watching them on the big or small screen, or interacting directly with them through a game, the key to any presentation of Sherlock is that he should seem almost supernaturally powerful through his intelligence and deductions. He should always be the smartest person in the room, his mind should already have worked out what you're going to be thinking tomorrow, and he should never be stuck for a solution or next investigative step. This magical perspective of events surrounding and entangling him is at the core of his appeal. He's the suave, smart, sophisticate that we wish we were.   Developer Frogwares is very adept at telling us that this is who Sherlock is, but it struggles enormously when it comes to putting us in his shoes. As I worked through the five self-contained cases of The Devil’s Daughter, each running roughly two hours, not once did I feel that swell pride in my chest that I typically associate with solving a puzzle or uncovering a mystery. Surely, this is a sensation you'd reasonably expect from a game that positions you as such a famous detective?  You're blocked from figuring things out more quickly than the designers expected. The problem is derived from the rigidity of its design. Essentially, this is a point-and-click adventure in which you move from place to place, talk to bystanders, and interact with objects. Engaging in these tasks provides you clues, and it's those clues that lead to the solving of the mystery introduced at the start of each case. Which would be fine, except that there’s a strictly enforced set of rules that blocks you from making speedy progression by actually being a detective and figuring things out more quickly than the designers expected. At points your reason for being in a certain place is obvious and you've found all that is useful to find, but you’re not allowed to progress until you've clicked on some remaining item in the room. All too often this item represents a minor stepping stone to a realisation that I’d already come to.    There are far too many moments in which I couldn't have felt more constrained. As a result, interaction with The Devil's Daughter is epitomised more by scanning rooms for unclicked objects than it is by conjuring up clever theories that might blow a case wide open. Having to scan every photo in a room, for instance, or click on every footprint around a suspiciously altered statue are not tasks that are terribly entertaining or enlightening to begin with, and once you've already come to an understanding of the situation in your mind they’re a chore. Despite playing a character known for momentous creativity and an ability to think outside the box, there are far too many moments in which I couldn't have felt more constrained. Diversity of action is attempted by incorporating various one-off minigame events. These range from an early stealth sequence in which you must stalk a person of interest through the streets of London, to cracking a safe, to playing a game of lawn bowls. While the variety is undoubtedly impressive, these tasks are fleeting in nature. Events come and go, never to be seen a second time. Before you have a chance to properly engage with their concepts and take pride in mastery of them they're removed and you're on to the next thing. Yes, they serve a purpose in breaking up the pointing and clicking, but their transience means all they ever are is a distraction. They matter so little you’re allowed to skip them entirely if you want.    The best moments give you the freedom to interpret mystical happenings as you wish. Before you get to those disappointments, The Devil’s Daughter lays some good groundwork. The initial setup for each case is interesting and often provocative, with some doing an excellent job of hinting at the existence of paranormal elements. The best moments are those during which you're given the freedom to interpret these mystical happenings as you wish, without it ever explicitly correcting you if you decide that there's something happening that's beyond our human comprehension. The acting, too, with one or two exceptions, gets a passing grade thanks to the cast managing to resist the urge to make every character sound as though they've been plucked out of an overly enthusiastic and clichéd rendition of Oliver Twist. Certainly, there are more than a few games featuring English characters in which everybody speaks using slang and tone not witnessed since 1830s London.   Voice work is accompanied by remarkably detailed visual presentation, particularly in interior locations. Rooms are densely packed with interesting items that don't necessarily relate directly to your investigations; Sherlock’s apartment, for example, is crammed full of mementos, books, and clutter that work to inform his personality. These help tempt you into thinking that this is a world that could exist with or without your presence and, as such, it’s the environmental design more than any of the available interactions that evokes the sensation of this being a story that belongs within the world of Sherlock Holmes. Just when you're enjoying the view, though, technical problems raise their head and bring the positivity crashing down. Animations are frequently awkward and noticeably jerky, and the consistency at which you get temporarily stuck on corners of scenery is inexcusable within a game that asks you to so deliberately move around the world and absorb it.  The loading times are, to say the least, lengthy. Then there are the loading times, which, to say the least, are lengthy. These are particularly irritating when you're asked to visit a location for only the briefest of moments in order to pick up an item or change clothes. Without exaggeration, the loading screens that bookend these swift trips can take up twice as much time as your actions themselves. Getting stuck on technicalities, rather than feeling as though you're playing Sherlock, sums up the majority of The Devil's Daughter. Despite some engaging storylines and well-designed environments, Sherlock Holmes: The Devil's Daughter fails to deliver any sense of actually playing the part of Sherlock. Its gameplay is too rigid and predictable, and at times comes across as too technically underdeveloped to ever wow or amaze. If anything, this stands as proof as to just how difficult it is to deliver a story whilst also making us feel as though we’re in control of our own destinies. If The Devil's Daughter were presented as a visual novel, however, there would’ve been little to complain about.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	 Hitman’s third episode sounds promising during the briefing: take out a corrupt banker seeking refuge in the Swedish embassy in Marrakesh, plus a bent General plotting a coup d'état holed up in an abandoned school. Between the targets sits a sprawling Moroccan marketplace and an angry mob baying for the banker’s blood at the embassy gates. Time is of the essence, 47 is warned, and the city is reportedly about to explode. And yet that pressure fails to translate to the level itself. It feels underdone compared to the previous missions – especially the excellent Sapienza hit – and is the least convincing and least engaging level so far.  There are no drastic revisions to the formula established by previous episodes here: you have to find your own path to executing two targets. Episode by episode, this new Hitman game is still building itself into the Hitman: Blood Money sequel Agent 47 fans have been craving for almost a decade. Unlike Paris (Episode 1) and Sapienza (Episode 2), however, Marrakesh is all sizzle and no sausage.  Hitman is still building itself into the Hitman: Blood Money sequel Agent 47 fans have been craving for almost a decade. It gets off to a great start, as 47 emerges from a series of narrow alleyways into a bustling square packed with spice stores and rug merchants, but there’s nowhere near as much meat to Marrakesh as there was to Sapienza. The embassy isn’t very large, and neither is the school, and both feel phoned in. I expected the embassy in particular to be a hive of tension based on the looming riot outside, but inside it’s a basic and bland office space dotted with a smattering of indifferent NPCs. Beyond the key kill locations there are a few rooftop areas containing useful items, but that’s about it. Compared to Sapienza, which felt ripped from a Bond movie, Marrakesh seems slightly more linear and less imaginative, with fewer forks in the road and fewer nooks and crannies to explore and exploit. There are some unique new disguises, but several of the kill opportunities are already rehashes. We’ve already done the bomb in the TV crew’s camera, team.  Worst of all, though, is the utterly horrific voice acting. I forgave it in Paris, and it bugged me in Sapienza, but here the sheer density of NPCs in Marrakesh and the abundance of dialogue make it a complete debacle. According to its constitution, Morocco has two official languages: Arabic and Berber (or Amazighe). The Constitution itself is penned in French, which is a second language for many Moroccans. And yet I’m not convinced developer Io Interactive has actually assigned anyone to Google this.  Almost everyone in Hitman's Marrakesh speaks with a native American accent. Almost everyone in Hitman's Marrakesh speaks with a native American accent. And it’s not just the tourists, it’s the local shopkeepers, and even the Moroccan army soldiers all sound like they’ve just strolled out of Fort Bragg. In fact, the only non-American accent I found amongst the Moroccan military was that of my target, General Zaydan, who speaks with a refined British accent (equally boggling, especially since during one spectacularly confusing conversation about Zaydan I overheard between two soldiers revealed he'd graduated from West Point; the United States Military Academy in New York, which is in neither Morocco or Great Britain). What the actual hell is going on here? Surprisingly, it actually gets worse the closer to the Swedish embassy you get. The protest leader is a proud Moroccan youth who sounds like he made a wrong turn at Santa Monica and took the long way to Spring Break. Spoiler alert: nobody in the Swedish embassy speaks Swedish either, because of course they don’t. It’s amateur-hour stuff, and wholly at odds with the intelligent and patient puzzle-oriented gameplay the team has successfully baked into Hitman so far. This dud VO work is seriously undermining the globetrotting, exotic atmosphere Hitman is trying to create. It’s a shame because, despite Marrakesh being a little more filler than killer, I’m still having a lot of fun with the new Hitman. Exploiting and outsmarting largely predictable AI remains the order of the day, but I still glean a great deal of satisfaction from plotting out a perfect path to a coveted suit-only (no costumes), Silent Assassin playthrough. Hitman Episode 3: Marrakesh doesn’t reach the highs of the previous levels and suffers more than ever from the extremely superficial approach to voice acting. It’s not a bad level, but it’s definitely one that I’d be less inclined to return to than the others I’ve played so far. It's the first time I've had to question Io's episodic approach: Over the course of a traditional game presented as a single package you may come across levels that dip in quality compared to the best ones, but you can always put those levels behind you and play the next. In the case of Hitman, we can only go back to the previous two. Marrakesh is what we’ve got for now, and it’s a slight step backwards.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	 It’s not easy to capture lightning in a bottle once, let alone twice. Yet developer Vanillaware has managed to do exactly that. Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir is an absolutely amazing remake of their 2007 sidescrolling action RPG that recreates and enhances everything I adored about the original, while strengthening and expanding its combat and role-playing to create one of the best gameplay experiences I’ve had in a long time. There’s a lot in Leifthrashir to celebrate, but at the very top of my long list is its super smooth 60-frames-per-second framerate. Leifthrasir runs like a dream, even when the screen is filled with angry fairy soldiers and fiery lizards. (The Vita version looks nearly as good and runs equally well.) It’s a massive improvement over the chuggy PlayStation 2 original, which screeched to a halt whenever multiple battle animations occurred. This near-perfect framerate also helps accentuate the already excellent mix of weapon attacks, special skills, and alchemic potions that work in tandem to absolutely wreck enemies on the battlefield.   Odin Sphere was quite pretty back in 2007, but Leifthrasir’s 1080p graphics make every frame a work of art I want to hang on my wall. Pillars that gleam like mother-of pearl in candlelight, verdant forests full of candy-colored flowers, and gardens spangled with fairy lights all made me stop playing just so I could gawk at the beautiful world around me. Leifthrasir’s hyperactive combat had me addicted like a digitized pixie stick  But I soon started moving and fighting again, because Leifthrasir’s hyperactive combat had me addicted like a digitized pixie stick. I love running laps around looping battle maps, cutting a swath of destruction with the five uniquely controllable characters and their magical psypher weapons. The action is nonstop, thanks to the ability to quickly switch between regular weapon attacks and two different skill types: action skills and phozon skills. Action skills like Needle Strike let you hit harder and faster with your weapon and are powered by a recharging meter, while phozon skills like Ice Shot are magic spells that replenish by collecting powerups from fallen enemies. And while you're recharging, you can serve enemies an explosive cocktail or two by combining different inventory items together using the super easy-to-use alchemy system. Building up combos and wailing on enemies for long periods of time using skills, standard attacks, and potions made me feel like Super Girl, and also earned me a higher combat ranking at the end of a battle. A higher combat ranking means better victory loot, which is pretty darn useful against tough opponents like the enormous dragon that spits hard-hitting garbage at you, and a very annoyed queen of the dead whose long-reaching spider legs require a lot of dodging and weaving. It’s all part of a hugely rewarding feedback loop that kept me playing late into the night.   Elevating the fantastic action is a richer role-playing system than what we saw in the original version. A plethora of diverse weapon skills like Gwendolyn’s enemy-stunning Ice Shot and Oswald’s bone-crunching Vile Rush can be unlocked by picking up Phozon Prisms scattered throughout the world. These skills can then be upgraded in any order you want using phozons collected in battle. Being able to instantly freeze enemies in their tracks by focusing on upgrading Gwendolyn’s ice attacks and turning Oswald into an unstoppable killing machine by maxing out his psypher’s strength felt great, and helped keep me invested in each character’s journey even as the story looped back around on itself and required me to visit the same locales to fight the same enemies over and over again. There’s also a series of very useful character skills  you can unlock, such as the ability to charm merchants into giving you a 30% discount on items. Also helping to keep me interested are the well-designed maps. Areas are flush with useful loot like gold coins and seeds for growing health-boosting food, and offer convenient warp points that eliminate tedious backtracking. Exploring their nooks and crannies is a joy thanks to imaginative mechanics, including one that lets you shrink into adorable pixie size and shimmy between wall cracks to access hidden treasure. It also makes combat a lot more hilarious, in a ant-kicking-an-elephant’s butt sort of way.   My favorite map addition, however, is Murrey’s Touring Restaurant. It’s kind of like a food truck you can summon in rest areas, only with a portable table and chairs instead of a truck. If you have the right ingredients and recipes, a delightful bunny-faced Pooka named Murrey will whip up tasty healing and experience-giving dishes for you. Murrey’s colorful blue-checked tablecloth and cheerful smile is always a welcome sight, especially when travelling to darker places like the gloomy Netherworld and ominous lava pits of Volkenon. He won’t even ask for coin, unlike other merchants that hang around towns and rest areas. Not that I minded handing over my cash, especially since it was so much fun to search maps for rare coins that I could spend at Pooka restaurants in between fighting monsters. (The food in Leifthrasir is so rich in detail it could be on the cover of Food and Wine.) I’ve always loved how events unfold Rashomon style  The 40-hour story of five heroes helping and hindering each other as they attempt to stop the end of the world hasn’t changed for the remake, and I’m glad. I’ve always loved how events unfold Rashomon style, as characters straight out of Norse legend defend their homelands and loved ones against evil factions that sometimes turn out not be be so evil when you see things from their point of view. Every character has something to love about them: there’s the stoic valkyrie Gwendolyn, the brooding shadow knight Oswald, the courageous Pooka prince Cornelius, the determined princess Velvet, and the feisty fairy Mercedes. Each of their story arcs are incredible, and I love how their seemingly separate fates intertwine into a larger arc. It’s a well-written story, accompanied by beautiful musical tracks like Titania’s acoustic guitar theme and Ringford Forest’s upbeat percussions. There’s also some solid English voice performances by actors like Karen Strassman (Gwendolyn) and Paula Tiso (Queen Odette), though Vanillaware also smartly added the option to switch to the Japanese voices for those that prefer hearing the characters in the original language. I feel like I’ve touched upon everything I love about Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir, and yet I still can’t seem to say enough good things about this amazing remake. Starting from an already-outstanding PlayStation 2 game, Vanillaware went above and beyond to realize its full potential with the addition of more role-playing elements, a near-perfect framerate, stunning graphics, better maps, and a more vigorous combat mechanic. Even after I finished playing, I wanted to go back and explore more areas, fight more enemies and collect more loot. It’s a continuous loop of fun, and I hope it never ends.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	 No matter how you slice it, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan isn't a fulfilling adventure. For as cool as the turtles and the bosses look, and despite hitting a pretty nice balance between classic cartoon nostalgia and entertaining new fans, the most important part of this ninja’s arsenal – the combat itself – is too chaotic to enjoy, even over its blink-and-you’ll-miss-it length. Mutants in Manhattan's story is as by-the-comic-book as can be: Shredder and Krang are attempting to take over the world and have dispatched and/or brainwashed rival mutants like Bebop, Rocksteady, Wingnut, and Slash. Whether you’ve checked out of the TMNT universe since the early 90s cartoon or are an avid watcher of the modern Nickelodeon version, it’s pretty easy to jump into Mutants in Manhattan’s world. The constants are nice: Donatello is the archetypical tech wizard, Leonardo leads, Michelangelo worships pizza over all else (except maybe nunchucks), and Raphael is pretty salty. While the turtles themselves are as entertaining as ever, April and Splinter are reduced to a static face on comms popups and inventory manager, respectively. I know the turtles are the stars of the show, but they could’ve used a better supporting cast.  Each of the nine bosses hides out in a familiar TMNT locales like New York streets, rooftops, and sewers. To Mutants in Manhattan's credit, most stages conclude quickly; you'll breeze through quick, randomized assignments like killing enemies, disarming bombs, and infiltrating hideouts in three to five minutes each, and then progress to a boss who doesn't take much longer to ninja to death. I enjoyed the street-based levels the most, as they offer the most openness but aren’t so big that I'd regularly get lost. The rooftops do offer a sense of wonder as the turtles glide from roof to roof and clamber up the sides of buildings, but objectives can be too spread out, and that leads to too much time wasted simply running between them (or falling to your death). Ironically, the turtles' home-turf sewers are the crappiest environments to traverse; they're full of dead ends, currents that send the heroes in a half-shell away from objectives, and way too many drains to hop down.  You'll visit many locales more than once, which amplified my anger. Completing all nine stages in Mutants in Manhattan runs around four hours total, but during that short time it beats the odds by still managing to become repetitive on multiple fronts. You'll visit many locales more than once, which amplified my anger toward the sewers and rooftops. Since the objectives all trade on variations of destroying or disarming a certain number of targets, it all blends together into repetitive and flavorless mayhem. The only thing that slightly tempts me to return to stages is to discover alternate boss battles, like how Rockstead joined the fray second time I attempted Bebop's stage, or Slash fighting alongside Wingnut when you run into the turtles' winged foe again. Even though they still often err on the side of insanity, the longer boss battles do include a modicum of strategy to avoid more pronounced attacks like gunfire patterns and invulnerable spinning attacks. On top of that, the inclusion of arcade-reminiscent multi-colored life bars makes the battle seem even more epic as you chip away through seven levels of life. But as much as those boss battles are relative high points the first time around and even better on a rematch, I'm not looking forward to slogging through another round of the samey objectives beforehand.  The bigger reason that I tired of Mutants in Manhattan’s routine so quickly is the chaotic combat. If it were possible to go it alone, I could see the dodging mechanic and proper use of cooldown powers adding nuance to the brawls. But since there are always three AI or online partners controlling whatever turtles you’re not playing as and aggressively jumping into the fray, it's just an unreadable mess of weapons, super-powered attacks, and pizza. When it mech-based combat is briefly added in the penultimate level, it was a breath of fresh air that came too late.  This system homogenizes the Turtles' fighting styles. What’s disappointing about how the green team fights is that so many facets of the combat are shared between all four of them. Each turtle has a group of four cooldown powers and can map four one-use items like health-restoring pizza, deployable turrets, and bombs, but items and powers all come from the same pool and can be assigned to whichever turtle you choose. This system homogenizes their fighting styles and takes some of the personality out of the heroes in a half shell (though it does remove the stigma of playing with Raphael and his short-range sais). It does make quick-swapping between them in single-player a lot less jarring, but that’s small consolation. Online-only four-player co-op doesn't add any excitement, either; even though you're stuck with the mutant you pick at the outset, the aforementioned insanity doesn't really lend itself to meaningful strategizing. Plus there's no couch co-op, so don't expect to relive old arcade brawler memories. The combat could also stand to be smoother; the framerate has difficulty staying at 30FPS, far below the benchmark of 60 you'd expect for Platinum's fast-paced action fare.  Outside of the aforementioned boss fight twists, the other incentives to make return trips to Manhattan aren't quite as alluring. Using XP earned in battle, you can level up the powers to reduce cooldown time or increase effectiveness, and there are plenty of passive skills you'll earn for earning high ranks in missions (like increased item effectiveness or sapping health from enemies with hits). But I found my ranks were effectively almost randomized, since they rely on the performance of your AI or online partners, and thus were barely even worth doing. Even with a super-short running time, the repetitiveness that pervades Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants in Manhattan makes this fight a slog. I've heard all the jokes the team has to tell and have marveled enough at the rogues gallery of bosses – both of which I could’ve done by watching this game on YouTube rather than playing it – so I'm not planning another trip to Manhattan.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	 Shadow of the Beast takes several old, and in some cases unrelated game design ideas, and skillfully recombines them into something surprisingly enjoyable. At face value it’s a simple side-scrolling action game, and it would be easy to write off its exorbitant amounts of gore as a smokescreen designed to hide a lack of depth. But amidst all the blood and severed body parts is a uniquely told story, delightfully rhythmic combat, and an ominously alien ambience that honors the legacy of the Amiga classic it’s based upon. My expectations of a showy, artless brawler evaporated within a few steps through the plains of Karamoon, where Shadow of the Beast begins. Elegant stone arches and gnarled trees dot a landscape that stretches far into the multi-layered background, lending an air of spaciousness and freedom despite our interaction with it being limited to walking left and right.  This picturesque, indescribably alien backdrop isn’t just window dressing either. A dynamic camera pans out and around it frequently as you continue forward, lingering on its sweeping landscapes and establishing a true sense of scale. Even once the arboreal beauty gives way to darker, more gothic tones, the art and camera work made me feel like an inhabitant of a world rather than a murderer just passing through.   But to be clear, you are exactly that when all is said and done. For the protagonist, Aarbron, killing is seemingly as effortless as breathing. In most cases a single press of the attack button immediately launches him into a slickly animated killing blow that changes depending on the type of enemy in front of him, the timing of the button press, and the distance to target. Watching Aarbron seamlessly transition from one kill to the next is an elegant bit of savagery, with many different context-sensitive animations blended into a continuous, satisfying dance of death. Watching Aarbron seamlessly transition from one kill to the next is an elegant bit of savagery.  Platforming, the thankfully few times you must do it, isn’t quite so well-implemented. Without a full running start, jumping feels vague and clunky, as does climbing up and sliding down walls. It’s largely kept to a minimum, but there are a few sections that rely on these and other light adventure elements more heavily than I’d like. One level in particular, Hydrath’s Castle, brings the pace to a screeching halt with an abundance of platforming, not to mention switch puzzles and copious backtracking through some visually boring areas. Oddly, it’s here, where Shadow of the Beast is most like its 1989 predecessor in terms of structure, that it fails. Initially, I was also concerned about whether combat would be too simplistic to stay interesting, considering that encounters are all stringently structured: two portals appear to block you into a small area and summon a set number of enemies who march predictably straight to you from both sides, like lemmings walking off a cliff to their inevitable doom. Further layers quickly reveal themselves though, not only saving the action from monotony, but lending it a surprising level nuance.  At a base level, just the number of different tools you’re handed is impressive given how confined the fights are. Aside from being able to block, dodge, or parry just about any attack, you can stun enemies where they stand (essentially staunching the flow of attackers from one direction for a time) or grapple and pummel them into submission before flinging their lifeless corpse away, preferably into one of their still-living buddies to stagger them for a moment. It’s all managed with simple, one-button inputs, so everything is intuitive to pull off, but the challenge is in deciding when to do what, and timing it properly so as not to take a hit. Before long, combat takes on a pleasing, steady meter, not unlike a beat/rhythm game – albeit with (a few) more flying limbs and camera-staining blood splatters.   Things become even more interesting when you start to consider the variety of special attacks and the resources you need to actively juggle. Health, Blood, and Wrath are all used to power Aarbron’s most devastating techniques, and knowing how to generate them and when to spend them is a key second layer to the mechanically simple fighting system. For instance, you need Wrath to use your screen-clearing Wrath of Aarbron ability, and that resource can earned by successfully landing another special attack – which costs Blood. Blood can be generated simply by successfully stringing hits together, or more quickly by executing an attack that reduces your own health whenever you use it. Of course, if you just hold onto your blood until it’s maxed out, you can unleash it all at once in a cinematic killing frenzy that can go on for as long as you can keep up with the button prompts. No one piece of the combat puzzle is difficult to understand or apply, but taken together it provides plenty of interesting, split-second decisions to make. When you choose wisely, Aarbron looks and feels like a godless killing machine. (That’s totally a compliment.) When you choose wisely, Aarbron looks and feels like a godless killing machine.  What’s even more interesting, though, is that the story succeeds from a very early point in casting doubt upon Aarbron’s motivations. It would have been easy to participate in what seems like a murderous power fantasy, and certainly the original Shadow of the Beast comes from an era in games where everyone who wasn’t you was as good as dead for no particular reason. But without getting into spoilers, this reboot toys with that notion in an interesting way, and the genius of it is that you could partially miss that based on how you play a key encounter in the first level. Much like games of old, the story here is sparse and mostly stays out of the way, aside from brief, skippable cutscenes here and there. All the dialogue is spoken in a variety of alien tongues which can only be translated if you spend earned points on understanding them. If, like me, you choose to spend points on combat upgrades instead, you can get through the five-hour story without knowing much of anything about Aarbron or the scores of aliens you help him vivisect. This keeps the story in the background if you want to just have an arcade-style action experience while also maintaining an effective air of mystery. Whether or not you dig deeper though, the story adds just a bit of weight to the proceedings without bogging down the pace.  As such, you’ll probably tear through Shadow of the Beast in just a couple of sittings, which would be more disappointing if there weren’t so many secrets to find in your next playthrough. Most of the background lore is tucked away in unlockable videos, and intrepid explorers will find hidden equipable items that further add to Aarbron’s arsenal of abilities. There’s even a small, but worthwhile cache of archival extras, including the original Amiga version of Shadow of the Beast, as well as its excellent soundtrack, and even a retrospective on the development of the entire trilogy. It’s a small touch, but it’s still nice to see a reboot that makes an effort to expose and preserve its source material. Perhaps the best reason to continue playing though, is the rich, arcade-style score-ranking system and leaderboards. Taking all the moving parts of the combat system, and then applying them differently to not just survive, but put up big numbers became a bit of a fixation for me. It’s just another example of how Shadow of the Beast speaks successfully to a different time in game design without feeling old and dated. From the way it relies on setting and music to tell the bulk of its story, to its use of simple mechanics on the way to score-based mastery, Shadow of the Beast takes old things and makes them feel decidedly less old. Walking to the right and killing everything that gets in your way may sound dull and straightforward, but here it’s elevated through thoughtful presentation, and combat that has more depth to it than initially meets the eye. Long after its many blood-soaked dismemberments fade from my memory, I’ll remember just how alien and otherworldly it felt between the fits of violence.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	 Update: Uncharted 4: A Thief's End has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  In amongst its frantic combat, slick parkour, and outrageous action choreography, Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End achieves something wonderful: maturity. This is less a breezy lad’s tale revelling in fortune and glory and more a story about the lads when they’re all grown up, bolstered by an equally developed graphics engine and career-high performances from its cast. A surprisingly assured set of multiplayer modes ices the cake. What lets it down, however, is an uninspired and overly long third act which slows down its pace considerably with curiously repetitive gameplay. Uncharted 4 consequently falls short of the greatness achieved by some of developer Naughty Dog’s leaner, more inventive predecessors.  Its 15-hour experience kicks off with focus. Uncharted 4’s story is established in a compelling handful of chapters that weave their way through different time periods with tightly directed cinematic flair. While its setup is overly familiar - Nathan Drake and Elena Fisher are attempting to retire from action-heroism and live a normal life until Nate’s presumed-dead brother turns up with an offer he can’t refuse - a strong emotional throughline is born from the characters’ struggle to reconcile their adult responsibilities with the promise of excitement they secretly crave. Uncharted 4 does a terrific job of exploring a more world-weary group of adventurers, with their concerns and musings layered throughout its quieter moments. These incidental conversations are a marvel. It’s here that we see characters bristle and soften, brought slowly to life with considered writing and a peerless voice cast. Performances from series veterans Nolan North (Nathan Drake), Emily Rose (Elena Fisher), and Richard McGonagle (Victor Sullivan) are as big-hearted as ever, while newcomers Troy Baker (Samuel Drake), Laura Bailey (Nadine Ross), and Warren Kole (Rafe Adler) are nicely understated in more enigmatic roles. Uncharted 4’s companion characters never break the spell in more frantic or tense sections, either. If you choose to play stealthily, they’ll crouch down in the long grass beside you (and unlike Ellie in The Last of Us, they do an excellent job of staying out of enemy sightlines). If they’re in your way while climbing, they’ll let you clamber over them. They’re competent in gun fights, helpful in traversal, and typically witty throughout. They feel vital.    This level of polish and slickness permeates Uncharted 4. During traversal you can now reach for platforms by controlling Nate like a puppet with the DualShock thumbstick, which leads to fluid, unbroken climbing. A new 4x4 controls well over tricky terrain, and Uncharted 4’s camera worships Nate’s grappling hook, lovingly zooming out as he swings off of cliff faces to bring home a magnificent vista. Steep gravel paths (a personal favourite) send Nate slipping across cliff faces like they were waterslides. Naughty Dog has expanded its terrain in order to make the most of these new tools. While I would have enjoyed more to do in this larger land mass - there’s disappointingly little to reward exploration of its various nooks and crannies beyond the occasional sparkling bit of treasure and a great view - I appreciated that occasionally there was more than one pathway to reach my goal. For a series defined by linearity, even the suggestion of choice is refreshing. There are a couple of wonderfully choreographed action sequences. The same can be said for the stages of more violent action. While you’re occasionally flung into the middle of a group of mercenaries with little to do but shoot your way out, other encounters take place on elaborate adventure playgrounds allowing for more stealthy play. I appreciated the option, even if this is fairly pedestrian and routine stealth gameplay in 2016: characters can be tagged for tracking, long grass is there for silent takedowns, and enemies linger on ledges begging to be grabbed by the ankle from below or kicked off from behind. That’s not to say it’s done poorly – it’s as polished as everything else in Uncharted 4 – it simply doesn’t do anything surprising or interesting. More, considering AI switches to a cautionary state at any sign of trouble, I was disappointed I couldn’t move bodies.  If you’re noticed, Uncharted 4’s bad guys will spring into action and distinguish themselves in combat. Open level design allows them to pull relatively intelligent moves like flanking, and they’ll rarely forget you’re there if you try to hide (while hanging off a ledge, for example, they’ll stamp on your hands). Such credible behaviour means you have to keep moving in battle; crouching behind an indestructible pillar to regain your health is no longer feasible. While shooting in Uncharted 4 is satisfying if unremarkable, enemies are now savvy enough – and thankfully less spongy – that there’s a genuine satisfaction born from each kill. It’s fun, frantic stuff. Somehow, the visuals keep up with it all. Unlike past Uncharted games where very strict linearity allowed for very carefully orchestrated beauty between stretches of more utilitarian sections built for action, Uncharted 4 manages to be all gorgeous, all the time. The big vistas are predictably impressive, but it’s the little details that really astound: the way snow settles on Nate’s hair, the shocking green of an underwater plant, the reflection cast off of an oil painting. The regularity of such beauty borders on ridiculous: it may be capped at 30 frames per second, but this is the prettiest game I’ve ever played.     With such strong systems at its disposal, then, it's disappointing that Naughty Dog doesn’t build more theatrical context around them. Regarding the series’ trademark outrageously choreographed action sequences, Uncharted 4’s campaign suffers from a curious lack of imagination. There are bright spots: there’s a brilliant car chase in Madagascar and a vertigo-inducing section involving clambering up a clock tower that really stand out. But otherwise the thrills here tend to be of a more predictable nature: lots of handholds breaking at the last minute, buildings coming down, an occasional easily solved puzzle in an opulent interior. It’s 2016, and after three Uncharteds (and two contemporary Tomb Raiders) we’ve seen it all before. This becomes a big problem in Uncharted 4’s third act, where the pacing slows down to a crawl. This jungle section is repetitive, and Nate and friends do little in it but climb and shoot, rinse and repeat. After a while, every encounter blurred into one amorphous amalgamation of shootouts, cliff faces, and pushing crates off of ledges for your companion to clamber up. As it’s the longest section in Uncharted 4, it eventually became a slog. Things pick up significantly by the end. The thoughtful exploration of these characters and their relationships with each other has a subtle payoff which bucks against the typical action coda, and it’s to Naughty Dog’s credit that it’s unafraid to stay true to its characters and their motivations, even if they aren’t as explosive as one might expect. Uncharted 4's visuals astound.   There’s not much to do in the main campaign once you’ve finished it, bar completing your treasure collection, but there’s extended life to be had in Uncharted 4’s confident 5v5 and 4v4 multiplayer. Though it’s still a sideshow to the main campaign in scope, its four modes – Team Deathmatch, Plunder, Command, and Ranked Team Deathmatch – embody the series’ most enjoyable qualities: camaraderie (your teammates can be revived when in a downed state), sheets of bullets, and a constant sense of momentum. On the latter point, it helps that the stages for play have been opened up from previous games thanks to the grappling hook: zipping around to high vantagepoints to get the drop on enemies lends itself to a dizzying sense of verticality. Deathmatch is ranked, which lends competitive longevity and appropriate skill matchmaking to Uncharted 4’s multiplayer, but Plunder and Command are the most fun. Command is a map-domination variant that places greater emphasis on teamwork by putting a target on the back of the strongest player in each team - the ‘captain.’ As you try and capture territories and hunt the enemy’s captain, you also have to protect against the opposing team trying to kill yours. You’ve got to be even more alert than usual, even as you’re pursuing an objective.  Plunder works similarly to previous Uncharteds, where the goal is to carry an idol to a central point on the map before the other team reaches it with theirs. Slowly heaving an idol to your teammate across a giant ravine while being shot at on all sides makes for a hilarious contrast in pace. A sense of chaos is further encouraged by the outrageous abilities you can now harness in all of Uncharted 4’s multiplayer modes. Spending earned points to temporarily wield supernatural powers like teleportation, which hurtles you across the map, and summon a sarcophagus that attacks the enemy with flying evil spirits can totally interrupt the rhythms of what would otherwise be a normal firefight. The AI sidekicks available for every player are a clever new addition, too. Instead of buying flashy powers, you can summon enormously handy AI-controlled helpers in battle. They’re capable of fulfilling basic tasks like sniping, brute-force shooting, and healing – as well as giving your opponents something to shoot at that isn’t your head. If you’re up against them, there’s a franticness born from trying to take them down while being attacked from all sides.  It plays beautifully. Because it runs at 60fps, the shooting feels better than it does in the main campaign, and there’s just as much fluidity to scaling walls and swinging, but now with a palpable smoothness. Naughty Dog does a great job at twisting familiar environments from the main campaign into interesting shapes across eight maps: soaring through the air against a boundless Mediterranean sea before leaping into the opulence of an Italian auction house – all the while shooting at other players – is exhilarating. These maps are well suited for shootouts, leaping, and magic powers. Wide open spaces peppered with lookout spots make for dramatic shootouts, winding corridors under heaving pirate ships are there for intimate encounters, and spots for the grappling hook are everywhere, meaning every game feels alive with motion. While it’s difficult to say what Uncharted 4’s multiplayer will look like in the future, there are enough unlockables and perks to act as a carrot for completionists, and Naughty Dog has promised more maps, mysticals, and a co-op mode in the future that I’ll be sticking around for. Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End is a remarkable achievement in blockbuster storytelling and graphical beauty. Though it’s let down by a lack of imagination and some self-indulgence, especially in a third act that drags on far too long, Uncharted 4 carries on the series’ proud tradition of peerless polish and style, with a great multiplayer component to boot. Most importantly, it’s a gentle sendoff to the rag-tag group of characters we’ve known for nine years. A worthy thief’s end, indeed.
Zachary Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	 The original Valkyria Chronicles came out on the PlayStation 3 in 2008. Here’s what we said about it in our original review: “Valkyria Chronicles is a game that all PS3 owners should at least try out, especially considering its unique blend of genre forms. With such a robust collection of extras to back up an already impressive mission roster and gripping story, Valkyria Chronicles comes highly recommended. I strongly encourage you to try it out and see the beauty of Gallia and its people.”   Valkyria Chronicles Remastered is a remaster done right. It’s a great way to experience a truly brilliant tactical RPG, or an excuse to revisit a cult classic that has aged with grace and beauty. And while you’ve likely encountered some of its themes in similar stories, Valkyria Chronicles’ war tale is told with such charm and wit that it’s hard not get wrapped up in Squad 7’s adventures from the jump.   Valkyria Chronicles adds a nice twist to the turn-based strategy formula by allowing players to take direct control of individual units and move them on the map in third person. This system puts each encounter somewhere between traditional tactics and shooters, as you line up head-shots and subsequently run for cover, hopefully before your Action Points run out and you potentially find yourself stranded in enemy crossfire. Your squad-mates only get one action per turn, which makes for some painstaking decision-making in the face of relentless enemies. Do you heal now to prepare for a counter-attack or fire off one head-shot at the risk of immediate retaliation? It’s a great way to experience a truly brilliant tactical RPG.  There are dozens of these moments in every battle, and each is as nerve-racking as the one before it. It’s a brilliant mechanic that encourages careful unit management, rewards precision, and keeps combat genuinely exciting from start to finish. This is particularly important, as you’ll probably wind up playing more than a few of the game’s encounters multiple times before achieving victory. The challenge here is rarely frustrating or repetitive, and while the learning curve is steep, it never feels unfair. Even when you find Squad 7 facing giant war-machines, fighting a seemingly insurmountable number of enemy troops, or crawling through the tall grass to avoid enemy spotlights, I found that if I took the time to prepare my troops and choose the right number in each class that victory was always within reach, even in the most daunting battles.  All that tension led to a true feeling of accomplishment when all my smart decisions culminated in white-knuckled, down-to-the-last-man victories. Conversely, if you don’t bring enough Lancers and Scouts to take out enemy tanks and shocktroopers, you can find yourself staring at a game over screen in a handful of turns.   Outside of Valkyria Chronicles’ battles, the rest of the game is mostly comprised of cutscenes. You can return to headquarters to reallocate troops, upgrade weapons and armor, and pay your respects to fallen soldiers, but the rest of the game is mainly comprised of cutscenes - loads and loads of cutscenes. Granted, the story told here is engaging and thoughtful, with a rich cast of compelling characters, even if the voice acting is occasionally hit or miss. It’s the little touches that make the world of Valkyria Chronicles so captivating.  Even the lowliest grunt on your squad has a backstory or interesting quirk that further compelled me to keep them alive. By the end, I found myself rooting for random scouts and snipers that I had taken with me onto the field and watched rise through the ranks. Each of these characters has innate buffs or weaknesses based on these backstories, and they even perform better when they’re paired with troops they are pals with. For example, if your fight is in the desert, you want to take someone with an affinity for fighting in the sand and couple them with a friend to add an easy bonus to their attack or defense. It encourages mixing up your team and taking different troops to different locales. It’s little touches like this that make the world of Valkyria Chronicles so captivating. Valkyria Chronicles' art direction is easily one of its most impressive aspects, and now that it runs at 1080p and 60 frames-per-second, the Canvas engine that powers the gorgeous “sketchbook” art style looks better than ever. It’s surprising how well the visuals have stood the test of time, and even more impressive is how instantly recognizable they are here. Saying that Valkyria Chronicles is inspired by World War II is a bit of an understatement and the cel-shaded battle tanks and armor are lovingly rendered, lending a genuine believability to the game’s alternate history motif.   Unfortunately, as far as re-releases go, Valkyria Chronicles Remastered delivers the bare minimum.  The original DLC missions and an Expert difficulty are also included, if you’re a glutton for punishment. Outside of that there are no additional bells and whistles, which is a bit disappointing, but it doesn’t tarnish the overall shine of the game itself. Ultimately, Valkyria Chronicles Remastered is a beautifully crafted and original tactical RPG. While this particular package is lacking in special features, it’s still a perfect opportunity to play a charming cult classic at a budget price.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/alienation-review	 Alienation delivers on the Housemarque promise of intense, finely honed, visually spectacular arcade carnage, but it also goes a few steps further. Its light action-RPG hooks don't dig as deep as something like Diablo 3, but they do add a satisfying power curve to chase while blasting through a twin-stick shooter that's prettier, more expansive, and more replayable than just about any other. Alienation’s controls are sharp, and enemies are plentiful and varied enough to keep a squad of up to four co-op players busy. Many are more nuanced than simple bullet sponges: shielded sentry turrets have nearby generators you can take out to make damaging them dramatically easier; snipers can threaten you from a couple of screens away but always telegraph their shots in a fair, visible way; and the monolithic Sentinels need to be bursted down quickly before their deadly beam attacks lock on and melt your lifebar away. Aside from providing a diverse set of threats, they also tend to die spectacularly for your viewing pleasure.  Well-placed cluster grenades send crowds of alien corpses careening comically in every direction, and special abilities like the Saboteur's airstrike rain incandescent death from the skies, filling the screen with pulsing, fiery particles. There’s a constant, welcome visual payoff for even the simplest kills. This is the stuff Housemarque always gets right, and it's especially true here – particularly in comparison to Dead Nation’s more grounded, dour look and feel.   Despite trading out its predecessor's reserved palette for gobs of Vegas-style neon light shows and a much snappier pace, Alienation  preserves and builds upon Dead Nation's progression systems. In so doing, it pushes ever so gently into action-RPG territory, but only enough to extend its longevity without needlessly compromising its clarity and focus. My obsessive mission to squeeze every last ounce of potential out of my legendary plasma shotgun was the real story for me.  One area where Housemarque went just a bit too simple for my tastes, though, was in the character classes and skill trees. Every ability is fun to use in one way or another, whether it’s using your cloaking device to set up a gaggle of aliens for a lethal, unexpected attack or erecting mobile shields that allow you and your teammates to fearlessly lunge headfirst into a hail of enemy fire. They just don’t evolve too much as you put points into them, nor do they really define specific playstyles for any given class. As an arcade shooter first, this doesn’t end up making a real dent in the fun, but it still would have been nice if your skill choices and party compositions were a bit more impactful.  In contrast, random weapon drops are the biggest, most meaningful addition to the formula. Each comes fitted with banks of interconnected slots for you to fill in with various upgrade cores that affect things like damage, rate of fire, clip size, and more. The number, formation, and color of these slots is important, since they dictate the upper limits you can push a weapon to, and which of its attributes have the highest ceiling. You can ignore the colored slots and just stack one stat, or match the colors of the slots to the nodes for bonuses. Add in the ability to re-roll any stat, or the sockets themselves, and there’s a lot of potential to stretch the life of a gun while tailoring it to your needs.   These upgrade cores themselves don’t exactly grow on trees, and neither do the various resources required for all that re-rolling, and this is where Alienation really got its hooks into me. Assembling low-level cores dropped from enemies into higher-level ones and salvaging useless drops for re-rolling resources became my reason to play and replay missions. Nevermind the loosely stitched-together plot about alien invasion and humankind’s last stand – my obsessive mission to squeeze every last ounce of potential out of my legendary plasma shotgun was the real story for me. This amassing of power provided the incentive necessary to get me and my squad scouring the expansive maps for every chance at a good drop.  Because of that, it’s a little disappointing that every weapon of the same type looks and behaves in essentially the same way visually, and that there are so few unique modifiers to set weapons apart aside from their stats and upgrade slots. My fully slotted shotgun could be orders of magnitude more powerful than yours, but they’ll always look identical, robbing me of the chance to inspire envy in my teammates. But even so, this amassing of power provided the incentive necessary to get me and my squad scouring the expansive maps for every chance at a good drop. Alienation’s overall structure is surprisingly well suited to this. Maps are giant by arcade shooter standards, and though your first five-hour run through the campaign will most likely be spent focusing on your primary objectives, subsequent runs offer up far greater possibilities.  Special events dot the map, including encounters with elite mini-bosses with random ability modifiers, horde ambushes, and the opportunity to raid alien hideouts for keys to highly rewarding one-off UFO missions. These, in turn, can provide keys to Ark Ship missions: timed co-op affairs with extremely resilient, high-level enemies. Alienation’s lack of local co-op particularly hurts here (it’s on the way, according to the developers) but it’s thankfully easy to find squadmates otherwise, owing to the fact that you always see a list of currently running missions whenever you go to start one of your own. Housemarque’s previous games have always kept me coming back through the strength of their gameplay alone. Alienation adds a straightforward, but enjoyable power chase on top, making its finely tuned arcade action all the more alluring. Its action-RPG elements won’t make it a replacement for something like Diablo 3 or Grim Dawn, but they successfully provide a structure for unending, enjoyable alien slaughter.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	" Insomniac’s Ratchet and Clank on PlayStation 4 is one of the most charming, creative, and rewarding adventures in recent memory. Tagging along with the peppy Lombax and his stoic robotic pal as they jet across the galaxy and blow up everything in sight is an absolutely gorgeous adventure brimming with hilarious writing, beautiful worlds, and an awesome array of weapons. Though it follows the same story as the 2002 original, this is far more than a remake or a remaster. Ratchet on PS4 is completely rebuilt from the ground up, pulling in some of the most successful elements of the series' later installments, while simultaneously bringing in some great new and refreshing ideas.   Back in 2002, the original Ratchet attempted to capture Pixar’s magic formula of colorful worlds, expressive characters, and nuanced jokes that could be appreciated differently by fans of all ages. Cut to 2016, and Ratchet on PS4 has finally cashed in on all of those promises. The lighting, the character models, and the vistas are among the most impressive I’ve seen in a game. It's one of those games that was hard to play for review while at my desk at work, because so many people would walk buy and linger just to ogle at the screen. Subtle touches, like the way light bounces off the reflective surface of a spaceship, or how Ratchet fidgets with his OmniWrech during his idle animation all come together to create a beautiful animated portrait.   Possibly most of all are the insane amount of effects that flood the screen during a particularly chaotic battle. Pieces of robots scatter across the environment, your weapons crack and boom like fireworks, and all the money that falls out of your victims is magnetized towards Ratchet, creating a beautiful maelstrom of destruction. Even amidst this sensory cacophony, the game's stellar frame-rate never takes a hit. Alongside this is the energetic, well-written story that’s rife with character and humor that works on multiple levels. The 15-hour campaign follows some of the same whimsical, Star Wars-inspired storyline as the original game, but adds depth to characters while expanding the scope of the adventure.   Insomniac has a superb penchant for wacky, satisfying weapons that it’s displayed in games like Resistance, Sunset Overdrive, and past Ratchet games, and here it is just as pronounced as ever. Whether it’s the Pixelizer that turns enemies into a pile of voxels, or the iconic Mr. Zurkon, whom you can once again summon to blast away enemies while delivering a slew of cheesy '80s action cliches, it’s a weapon lineup that’s full of visual surprises and humor. Aside from their variety and originality, I absolutely love the upgrade system at play here. Weapons level up as you use them, which rewards your specific play-style in a meaningful way. At the same time, I wanted to see how other weapons would similarly grow, which encouraged me to experiment with weapons I might normally pass on. Each gun also has a modifier grid you can slowly flesh out, which give you active aids like increased width for a flamethrower, or passive ones like a higher chance of item drops. I found myself playing Ratchet for ""just one more hour"" not only to make it to the next planet, but also because I became mildly addicted to growing and upgrading my arsenal.   You’re encouraged to do that by revisiting planets you've already cleared and using new abilities to access new areas, but this leads to a disappointing revelation -- they’re empty. Mobs of varied enemies and awesome cinematic action scenes are replaced by long stretches of nothing but a scant smattering of low-level cannon-fodder. I wanted and was encouraged to go back and find all the hidden Bolts that unlock cool extras, in but I couldn't help but feel like I was visiting the set of a summer blockbuster years after the cameras had stopped rolling.   While blowing up anything and everything makes up the delightful core of Ratchet, the entire adventure is peppered with a generous variety of gameplay twists. Throughout your journey, you’ll acquire boots that allow you to grind on rails, leading to some exhilarating sequences where you’re twisting and turning up the spiral of a tower, hopping from line to line while batting mines away. Likewise, once you stumble across the jetpack, you’re able to more freely explore the nooks and crannies of a world, which yields great rewards as long as you can keep an eye on your fuel gauge. Ratchet and Clank is a culmination of everything Insomniac has done with the series over the past 14 years. It takes the characters that we fell in love with long ago, and sets them off on their most gorgeous quest yet. The deep and rewarding weapon system, beautiful and varied worlds, and charming-as-heck story make it an adventure that anyone with a PlayStation 4 should strap in for."
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	" Multiplayer online battle arenas rarely have a need for a strong narrative background: In a game like League of Legends or Heroes of the Storm, you can chuck a bunch of characters with conflicting motives onto a table and order them to fight and no one will bat an eye. Dead Star is a little like that with its three races, but I learned there's a deeper story hidden in casual lines in the tutorial and hidden text snippets in the options. You can rightly regard it as little more than a MOBA mixing in elements of top-down twin-stick shooters, but as it turns out, this is also the tale of a bunch of war criminals and general scum doomed to battle for scraps in a dying solar system until its red giant goes supernova. And that's the overarching theme of the whole experience--an unexpected degree of depth hidden below a simple and accessible veneer. Allow me to push the analogy further, and I'll say a few issues with the lore also presage the few issues with the game itself. That supernova bit, for instance? That'll never happen: red giants die with a whimper, not a bang.  But all this spacey stuff certainly allows for a generally awesome sci-fi aesthetic, which reveals itself in details like the avatars given out as achievement awards that look like they were pulled from cyberpunk graphic novels or Marvel's Infinity Gauntlet. Toss in the fact that Metroid Prime alum Todd Keller serves as the art director, and Dead Star emerges as an uncommonly visually appealing experience for its price.   And the game is generally fun, too. The skeleton here is familiar 5v5 and 10v10 MOBA stuff: you know, the capturing of enemy bases, the securing of outposts, and the selection of new abilities for your fighter as the match progresses. Blast apart surrounding asteroids for ore, pump them into your home base or the outposts you capture on the way to the enemy base, and boom, you've got some buffs that augment the surrounding defenses. Same old, same old. One of Dead Star's gorgeous views. But Dead Star brings some notable and interesting differences, particularly as regards the ships doing the fighting. There's only nine of them (with three tiers for small, medium, or large ships), but that doesn't seem so small a number in action on account of the impressive variety of abilities they bring. What's more, all these abilities are impressively balanced, to the point that I never felt completely helpless regardless of what ship I was in. Dead Star is an uncommonly visually appealing experience for its price.  Take the plodding, powerful Justicar, which emits a powerful repair field that heals friendly units and slices up enemies with lightning cannon I can control with the right stick. It can easily hold its own. Then there's the tiny Razor, which surrounds itself with an ""energy saw"" that slices through anyone foolish enough to get too close, and it can even put on some hurt when it whisks past a passing Justicar. Medium ships like the Bulldog also have some cool toys like the Time Bomb, but I rarely used them since the smallest and the biggest tiers seemed too effective with their fast-versus-powerful roles to bother with a jack-of-all-trades. One of the great things about Dead Star is that I could bring all three along anyway if I changed my mind about needing that Time Bomb. Dead Star makes a welcome break from most MOBA designs by letting its players switch between the three ships as needed in a match. It's great for dealing with gaps in strategy when the need arises. When I noticed my teammates were doing a shoddy job of keeping the outposts we captured stocked with ore, I'd hop in my Razor and dart about blasting rocks instead of jocks. When my teammates were making a heavy push on the enemy base, I'd hop in my Justicar and keep them healed so they wouldn't have to fly all the way back from the nearest outpost. It's especially a nice way of dealing with the little vagaries of a match, such as when a key role gets dropped because a teammate rage quits.   That didn't happen too often, but it occurs with enough frequency to call attention to some of the flaws in Dead Star's design. As things stand, teams who capture a few outposts early on will have an almost guaranteed chance of winning, partly because upgrading them with ore augments them to the point that it's tough to take them out without a concerted effort. And right now, with so many teams on the PC and PS4 (which amount to the same, as Dead Star supports cross play) playing in random groups, those efforts just don't happen. It doesn't help that Dead Star favors defense, as players defending an outpost will respawn in a handful of seconds at the very outpost being attacked. It also doesn't help that Dead Star has an awful tendency to dump new players into the middle of a match in progress, when coordination over voice chat has already broken down and most players have given up. Lasers, lasers everywhere. This tragic state of affairs isn't always the case. With two sets of more or less equally matched teams, Red Star's matches approach near artistry. Those coordinated attacks actually happen, and players switch out roles when they need to and agree upon objectives. I was blessed to experience that three times, and once with what I believe was awfully random group. (The randomized grids that make up the battle map, we said, aligned in our favor.) Unfortunately, most players joining random groups will come to fear teams, and I found the matchmaer paired my little newbie companions against groups with multiple ships leveled well into the teens far too often. The aforementioned balance at least allows random players to put up a decent fight, but in the end the resistance dies out like the star itself. That's been my experience with Dead Star, and I admit it hasn't been the full one. One of the big selling points of Dead Star is that it supposedly includes an ""Escape Run"" mode that triggers from a rare drop, and it lets you and your team escort a capital ship as you sail through other matches in progress, keeping the ship intact and fighting off other players on a third front. Sounds fun, right? Alas, it's so rare that I never actually saw it in my gameplay, and neither has anyone else I know.  I'm happy to report that Dead Star is fun enough that I want to keep playing it to see what this plays like in practice. And considering that it's currently free for PlayStation Plus members? That's a compelling reason to jump in while Dead Star is still full of life from its recent release.  Dead Star has the basics of combat and ship balance right, to the point that even losses have their fun moments. Its primary shortcoming is that it allows too great an advantage for pre-made groups, which is especially a problem considering the wonky matchmaker."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	 Genre fusion can often be nothing more than a developer clumsily smashing together two popular things in order to make a third, ultra mega popular thing, but Enter the Gungeon makes skillful use of elements from both sides of its family tree. Even judged purely by arcade shooter standards, Gungeon makes the grade, and its carefully implemented roguelike elements add variety, structure, and replayability to that base. It’s all wrapped up in a breezy, delightfully silly package that kept me shooting, smiling, and shooting some more. Enter the Gungeon is all about bullets and guns and shooting stuff. No really, it's all about that – to a hilarious degree. The story revolves around a giant uber-bullet that falls from the sky, shell casings and primer rims are worked into the otherwise-standard environmental art at every opportunity, and many of your enemies themselves are (you guessed it) actual bullets who fire what I suppose are their little cousins out of the guns they hold with stubby, T-Rex-like hands. This mix of goofy fetishism is immediately disarming, setting a unique, charming tone right away.  It’s not all just for looks either – a deep love of arcade shooters is present throughout. Aiming is precise, with just the right amount of stickiness to keep it from feeling too hard or too easy to hit moving targets. Right from level one, there are enemies capable of throwing sinkfulls of bullets your way, giving veteran shmup jockeys ample opportunity to show off their juking skills, while a partially invincible dodge roll can get you out of tight spots when your left thumb can't. The roll was clearly considered in the design of many areas and battles, making it a vital tool rather than an optional crutch for getting out of jail for free.   This is especially so for the slew of memorable bosses, who will truly test your mettle by filling the screen with nonsense and plunging you into a true bullet-hell. The one-eyed Behoslter for instance, in addition to the standard array of bullet eruptions, will switch constantly between spawning little minions to take shots at you, firing homing rockets that need to be shot down before they reach you, and a continuously sweeping death beam that needs to be perfectly rolled over. What ensues is a fast-paced juggling act that challenged both my reflexes and my brain. All hail the Bullet King! The minions who fill the halls of the Gungeon are no less varied. From floating iron maidens that spew bullets that try to hit you coming and going to finger-wiggling bullet wizards who project astral copies of themselves to attack you around walls or behind cover, the enemy variety ramps up nicely as you go from level to level, providing an ever-shifting set of challenges to meet as you progress. Right from level one, there are enemies capable of throwing sinkfulls of bullets your way.  As diverse and interesting as your foes are, though, the wide array of guns and gadgets is the true star here. Your arsenal is full to bursting with both conventional firearms like the enemy-penetrating sniper rifle or the winchester, and decidedly non-conventional ones like a fire-spewing pitchfork or a laser rifle that sends bullets flying back lightsaber-style whenever you reload. Things like clip capacity, accuracy, and bullet spread help differentiate your MAC-10s from your M4s, and nice reloading and shooting sound effects make even the most basic starting guns fun to fire off for a bit. Still, there are a few too many dull, conventional weapons – I couldn’t help but feel pangs of disappointment whenever I’d open a chest and find one of the many similar shotguns or handguns instead of something crazier.   The funky stuff is where it’s at though, both for the humorous descriptions and clear pop-culture influences, and because much of it opens up altogether new ways to play. One passive item, the Metronome, lets out a little chime with every kill you make without switching guns or taking damage. That noise means your currently equipped gun is getting stronger and stronger with each downed foe, to the point where even a basic pistol can shave chunks of life off a boss if you’ve really been on a tear. One of my favorite guns fires two projectiles out in opposing sin curves, and if they come back together to intersect without hitting anything else, the resulting fusion reaction causes a massive explosion that can clear the screen if placed properly. These aren’t just laser guns of different colors and sizes, but wholly unique tools that provide a ton of fun, creative ways to blow enemies to bits.  Roguelike elements are applied sparingly so as to complement the shooter gameplay rather than smother it. Each floor of the Gungeon is a made up of a random configuration of hand-crafted rooms, so everything feels well placed, but you never settle into a monotonous rhythm. Chests, shop items, and boss drops are all totally random, so one run I might be blanketing rooms with a molotov launcher and mopping up with a gun that fires homing skulls, and the next I might multiply the damage output of my Mega Man-inspired buster cannon with a projectile-doubling active item. Even the bosses you face are randomly pulled from a pool, so you can't lazily prepare for the same threats on every run. The only roguelike convention that felt underdeveloped was the selection of playable characters, who didn’t feel different enough from one another for me to gravitate towards any one of them. As diverse and interesting as your foes are, though, the wide array of guns and gadgets is the true star here.  A light spattering of dungeon traps, NPCs to save, and sacrificial shrines round things out, but these elements serve more to add variety than to force you to make the best of bad situations like in other roguelikes. This keeps the focus squarely on your ability to move and shoot - a lucky drop can certainly make life easier, but I never died and thought “Man, I really got screwed on this run.” It was always “Man, I should try and suck less next time.” Enter the Gungeon also employs a few quality-of-life elements that keep the action moving at a constant pace where other games slow down. After clearing a room of baddies, all the currency they’ve dropped just magnetically pulls to you, even as you’re running to the next room – you never need to waste time scouring for every last penny before moving on. Teleporter nodes are sprinkled liberally across the well-marked dungeon map, making it easy to quickly identify doors you haven’t opened or items you’ve left behind and return to them without having to hoof it through too many empty rooms in the process. There’s even a quick-start prompt that comes up during the opening splash screens that drops you directly into a fresh run as the last character you played with. Rarely have I gotten into the action so quickly. Enter the Gungeon’s design is quite sophisticated for a game about shooting bullets at anthropomorphized bullets with guns; it uses elements of one genre in the context of another, enhancing its most enjoyable elements. Despite there being so many more moving parts than in a typical arcade shooter, it somehow feels more immediate and focused on getting you into the action and keeping you there. And where other similar games can run out of novelty within a few hours, Enter the Gungeon is still surprising me with new implements of destruction after 50 hours of play.
Chloi Rad	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	 If the first Dark Souls depicted a world gracefully drifting towards the apocalypse, Dark Souls 3 shows one on a spiraling, feverish descent directly into it. It’s a fierce and punishing behemoth that dares you to take a step forward before knocking you back, again and again and again. But with a bleak, yet beautiful world that’s enthralling to explore and packed with secrets to find, I always felt compelled to come back, eager for that familiar thrill of overcoming even the most exacting challenges. Dark Souls 3 does suffer from occasional framerate dips and a few underwhelming boss fights, but beyond that, its epic scale, aggressive obstacles, and rich development of existing lore make it the grandest and fiercest Dark Souls adventure yet.   The Kingdom of Lothric and the lands that lie beyond contain some of the most visually striking places developer From Software has ever crafted. Even though many of its locations do recycle ideas from familiar locales (like the Catacombs and yet another poison swamp), they're distinguished well enough to feel distinct from their past game parallels. There was never a moment when I didn’t feel captivated by their strong sense of place and the amount of gorgeous detail put into each environment. I stared out in awe atop the crumbling medieval stronghold of the High Wall, taking in the view of its surrounding valleys and snow-capped mountains, while all around me the fort’s frenzied denizens turned to stone and wood mid-prayer. I trudged through the poison swamps of the Road of Sacrifices while battling seething, cross-bearing beasts, braved Irithyll’s chilling, Tower of Latria-like dungeon, and got lost in a multi-story maze of curse-ridden bookshelves in the Grand Archives.  Dark Souls 3’s world does a lot to reward an inquisitive and thorough nature. Every level is not only full of breathtaking architectural marvels and the most minute environmental embellishments, but also dense with things to do and see from moment to moment. But those views are more intense than Dark Souls 3 can handle – dramatic framerate dips (which we saw even on an ultra-high-end PC with two GeForce GTX Titan Zs) caused a lot of these fantastic looking areas to drag along, sometimes down to 20 to 25 FPS. But the rest of the time, when it is running at a smooth 60 (on PC only), Dark Souls 3 is a sight to see.   Exploration of the aforementioned places is the cornerstone of this series, and Dark Souls 3’s world does a lot to reward an inquisitive and thorough nature. You could spend hours in a single area, diligently investigating every dark corner or side road, and be consistently rewarded with some interesting story revelation, new gear, mini bosses, and even entire secret areas. Illusory walls make a triumphant return, driving me to compulsively slash away at suspicious-looking dents or bricks in search of precious equipment. I got a pretty high rate of return on doing that, too, from the earliest levels to the very late game. Crystal lizards also must have had a breeding season, because there are a ton of them slithering around, ripe for the slaying and with lots of twinkling titanite for leveling up special weapons.  A mostly triumphant return to the kind of large-scale, world-focused journey of Dark Souls 1. Dark Souls 3’s world isn’t as openly interconnected as that of Dark Souls 1 (where you can freely move between high and low-level areas), but individual areas still weave their own branching paths together seamlessly, creating twisting mazes of overlapping passages and shortcuts that were a joy to lose myself in. Perhaps it’s because of this lack of interconnectivity that Dark Souls 3 feels larger than the first game. Early and late-game levels don’t directly connect as often, so the more you progress linearly from level to level, the farther it seems like you’ve journeyed. Your progress is marked by massive landmarks, which lend the world a cohesive quality. In several early levels, I could maintain sight of the High Wall from which I’d originally come; while trying to extinguish a series of beacons as part of the entry process for a boss, I scaled a huge ladder through the thick canopy of trees blocking my view and could see clearly where I was in relation to the first level. I recalled seeing nearly this exact place too, from another spot on the High Wall.   This solid sense of space and geography elevates Dark Souls 3’s level design beyond the relatively weak blueprint of Dark Souls 2, making a mostly triumphant return to the kind of large-scale, world-focused journey of Dark Souls 1. Perhaps the only things sadly missing from Dark Souls 3’s environments are the kind of interesting platforming challenges present in places like Dark Souls 1’s Sen’s Fortress or Crystal Cave.   There are plenty of interesting characters to meet throughout Dark Souls 3, some new and some returning. The voice acting is great as always and characters have a ton of dialogue to exhaust, offering up plenty of new emotes to perform, dropping useful hints about the world and your role in it, and generally cementing themselves as the next in a line of odd, yet lovable Souls personalities. Like in past games, NPC questlines remain mysteries to be solved over the long term of your adventure, so in my first 35-hour playthrough they weren’t all completed. I let a couple characters die because of my failure to encounter them in certain areas or meet certain circumstances, but in keeping with true Dark Souls fashion, even death has its rewards: those conclusions still had something interesting to offer in the way of tragic closure, sometimes tied to other plot details in startling ways, or neat new items.   I look forward to following these questlines more closely in future playthroughs, but I worry that a few bugs I ran into in my first one might impede that. Early on, one particularly sneaky character appeared to ask me for forgiveness for a past misdeed, but it was my first time meeting him in Dark Souls 3. I later found out that he was supposed to show up at a certain spot much earlier, but he must’ve missed his cue. Another character who showed up after I’d spoken to a covenant leader swore the two of us were enemies from then on, even though I had never met her prior to that. I wasn’t even part of the covenant – even though joining any one of Dark Souls 3’s eight covenants is now as convenient as snapping a badge in place in your inventory, I hadn’t done that here. But I suppose for this disgruntled NPC, just talking to the leader is good enough.   The brutality of Dark Souls 3’s worlds and the beasts that roam there are matched only by its vicious new moves called weapon arts, which add variety and style to an already strong combat system: one moment I’m crushing enemies with the devastating weight of my greatsword, the next I’m turning the giant hunk of curved steel into a graceful propeller of destruction.  Dark Souls 3’s weapons are aggressive and multipurpose. Executing these skills use up focus points (FP), the newly added blue bar below your HP and above your stamina that also acts as mana for casting spells and pyromancies. When your FP runs out, some weapon arts, like the aforementioned greatsword propeller (Exiled Greatsword – seriously, use it), start costing stamina instead – a sensible and acceptable trade-off. Certain other skills, like a lightning spear that lets you charge at enemies with an electrifying blast, let you complete the move without the elemental damage until you recover FP, so running out of FP isn’t necessarily urgent or mood-killing. It becomes far more important when you’re a spellcaster, because the amount of spell charges you have depends on FP, but the system is actually more generous than it is limiting. That’s because of a new reusable item called Ashen Estus.   Besides resting at a bonfire, the primary way of recovering FP is Ashen Estus. You can easily allot a number of uses for these blue flasks by speaking with the blacksmith in the hub world. If you have a maximum of 10 flasks (increased by giving Estus Shards found in the world to the blacksmith), then you can designate five for healing Estus and five for Ashen Estus, a decision which can be changed anytime you want. Having a way to recharge FP on the go means more freedom to use spells and pyromancies, which means more opportunity to play dependently on magic – great news for spellcasters.   Some of the most awesome-looking weapon arts, and one of the most impressive strides in Dark Souls 3’s combat in general, come out of its dual-wielded weapon sets. A clean system for dual-wielding most combinations of weapons and an awesome arsenal designed specifically for it means it’s now actually viable to have a dual-wielding build in Dark Souls. The risk of not having a shield has always been one part of what’s so enticing about dual-wielding, and some of Dark Souls 3’s weapons are just aggressive and multipurpose enough to make you not even miss it.   One greatsword and dagger combo in particular lets you perform several wide, sweeping slashes, driving groups of enemies back before delivering a final, mid-air blow. You can also quickly lock onto new enemies mid-chain, prioritizing dangerous or vulnerable individuals in a mob to maximize the effect of your attacks. I unleashed this attack to deal with situations where a group of smaller enemies surrounded a larger and more dangerous leader, slashing away at the minions before executing the last heavy blow on the main enemy in the middle.  Dark Souls 3’s roster of relentless horrors hit harder and sometimes faster than ever. Weapon arts also make shields more fun to use by giving them more variety. Some shields lack the parry ability, using the same command to instead quickly perform your right-hand weapon’s skill without the need to manually two-hand it. Some shields are capable of shield-bashing attacks, too – yes, this means you can dual-wield greatshields. In fact, you can dual-wield just about any combination of weapon with complete right and left-handed movesets, which makes the opportunities for awesome and bizarre builds seem nearly endless. That’s not even counting boss weapons, which come with unique weapon skills that, paired with Dark Souls 3’s fantastic collection of new and returning armor sets, allow you to not just look like your favorite characters and bosses, but perform their signature attacks as well.   Boss weapons are extremely easy to craft, too – a character in the hub world trades them for souls (boss soul included) after being given an item you receive relatively early on. One boss soul can yield multiple weapons and even spells or rings, so collecting them all encourages multiple playthroughs. It also makes the choice of what to actually craft a little harder and even nerve-wracking: after creating a silly sounding pyromancy from a Stray Demon soul, I was saddened to learn I’d somehow skipped over Havel’s Ring, which once again increases your equip load – vital for heavy armor and weapon users who want to maintain that quick roll. Let my mistake be your warning: choose your boss gear wisely! (And for the love of Havel, get that guy’s ring.)  The titanite used to upgrade weapons is extremely plentiful in Dark Souls 3. Having access to a versatile arsenal of destruction is handy, because Dark Souls 3’s roster of relentless horrors hit harder and sometimes faster than ever. AI invaders, special characters who appear in specific areas to do battle, make a valiant return, fighting with the speed and aggression of a skilled PvPer. Relative to past Souls games, enemies here are also unusually crowded and agile. This added a new but welcome layer of challenge as well as some great opportunities to make the most of my weapon arts. I found myself approaching combat situations with even more caution and planning than Dark Souls usually requires. On top of the usual strategies – hiding behind a shield, aggroing one enemy at a time with the now-pleasingly quick Short Bow, going in for the backstab to cut a battle short – I also spent more time observing the environment and making sure I knew my exits. In more than one instance, a relentless line of shield-bashing, weapon art-using knights had me making a beeline straight for the next bonfire before attempting to deal with them. I also kept several types of weapons reinforced for dealing with all kinds of situations. The titanite used to upgrade weapons is extremely plentiful in Dark Souls 3, so no farming is necessary to keep those handy options ready.   Dark Souls 3 experiments a lot more with the boss-battle structure, yielding mixed results. For example, most boss fights have two phases, in much the same way Bloodborne does, which means new movesets and sometimes a brand-new health bar can emerge halfway through a battle to keep the tension mounting and prevent you from getting lazy with your tactics.  Most of the bosses are a fun challenge. While most boss fights are traditional, Dark Souls-style battles of slashes, shields, and rolls, some bosses have well-placed weak spots that must be targeted to deal damage, or require a bit more puzzling to take down. This occasional experimental approach to bosses was always interesting in concept, but more often than not resulted in underwhelming or anticlimactic fights. Taking down a hulking giant in four hits is a waste of an awesome boss design, even if the method is pretty cool – and once you know how to do it, that boss is never really threatening again.   It isn’t like Dark Souls 3 has a shortage of awesome boss designs, though – ranging from majestic to frightful, some even made me gasp in shock over the lore implications of their look, or music, or circumstances, and most did have an exciting and tough battle to match. Those framerate dips made an unwelcome return during some of these fights, however, rendering all the excitement occasionally hard to look at. But most of the bosses are a fun challenge for good reasons, and some of those battles made me feel outmatched enough that I was compelled to use another of Dark Souls 3’s new mechanics. Embers, the Dark Souls 3 equivalent of Dark Souls 1’s Humanity, elevate you from Unkindled to Kindled form, which gives you access to online features and adds a cool, burning effect to your armor. Similar to Demon’s Souls’ Body/Soul Form system, being Kindled also grants a boost in HP that is lost on death, but the extra HP is more of a reward for being Kindled (which is automatic when you defeat a boss) than a penalty for being Unkindled. The HP boost was nice insurance to have during a particularly tough boss, but not necessary for all of them.   The real value of Embers is their requirement to use online features. I defeated all the bosses solo on my first playthrough, but a few test runs with co-op and password matchmaking proved that jumping into fights with friends is quick, easy, and fun, so you’ll want to have those Embers ready for multiplayer. I never ran out of Embers during my playthrough and even if I did, a few enemies drop them and some merchants at the hub sell a limited number. If Dark Souls 3 truly is the last in the series as we know it, then it’s a worthy send-off. Weapon arts allow stylish and versatile new moves without tarnishing the purity of the combat system. Lothric’s awe-inspiring locations provide visually stunning arenas for rigorous exploration and fierce face-offs with hosts of deadly enemies and even deadlier bosses. While not all the risky changes land as neatly as others, Dark Souls 3 is a powerful journey and the sequel the series truly deserves.
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	 MLB The Show 16 carries the torch for the long-running Sony series, and continues to raise the bar in nearly every aspect. Building on the already-strong foundation of MLB 15: The Show, the overall aesthetics, franchise mode, road to the show mode, and especially Diamond Dynasty mode all received meaningful additions that make this year’s game better than it’s ever been. When dealing with simulation games, the way real-life people and places look in the virtual world can make or break the level of immersion and believability. Here, the new lighting effects make a noticeable improvement in how the field itself and different materials on it look. For example, different types of metals are noticeably brighter, while the new matte helmets are more dull. It’s an attention to detail that stands out.  But while ballparks look better than ever, it’s the way the players move that jumps off the screen the most. A large amount of animations from years past have been redone, and are so fluidly stitched together that passersby might mistake it for the real thing. Specifically, the way pitchers transition from their pitching animation into fielding is smooth and natural looking.  The real prize of this new edition is the Road to the Show career-simulation mode. Of course, incremental graphical improvements are expected year to year. The real prize of this new edition is the Road to the Show career-simulation mode, which makes its triumphant return with a few clever new features that start at the very beginning. This year you begin your career with an authentic-feeling scout day, where your performance in hitting and fielding drills results in an official scouting report. Once you get drafted and start leveling up your player, consumable and passive perks become available, and those open up interesting new ways to feel like your player has super powers, even if you’re not a star MLB player.   Consumable perks can only be used once per game, but can be activated at any time. Having a “flyball hitter” perk, which forces fly balls if contact is made, really came in handy when I needed a sacrifice fly to win the game. I was able to do exactly what needed to be done, in a simple and straightforward way. Having that kind of control (which the batting system doesn’t typically offer) once per game opens up more strategies. Other perks include things like eliminating foul balls for the at bat, and forcing the next pitch to be right down the middle.  Perks are great because they artificially create great baseball moments. Passive perks, on the other hand, come into play automatically depending on the situation. For example, if you find yourself at bat with the bases loaded, you can fast-forward to a 3-0 count, forcing the pitcher to throw strikes. You can also make the umpire use a hitter-friendly strike zone, or have the altitude be similar to that of Coors Field, which makes home runs easier. Perks are great because they give you the option to make meaningful situations lean in your favor and artificially create great baseball moments, but still force you to actually make the play yourself.   There is a cost to using perks, however, and that makes using them a difficult decision. Each perk, depending on how powerful it is, removes time from the brand-new ShowTime meter. ShowTime allows you to slow down time in critical moments, helping you to either make a clutch play, or make a complete fool of yourself as you miss anyway. Although it can take some getting used to, it can really come in handy when you’re batting and want to get a better read on the pitch, when you’re on defense and need a faster reaction, or when you’re attempting to steal a base and want to perfectly time your jump.  Is all of this cheating? Yes, a little. But it’s also fun. At first glance, ShowTime might feel a bit too “gamey” for a baseball sim, but since ShowTime is only available in Road to the Show, the new feature artificially creates and enhances big moments for your player. Is all of this cheating? Yes, a little. But it’s also fun, and the AI doesn’t care if you’re not playing fair. The best part about perks and ShowTIme is that they’re optional: you can completely ignore those features if they’re not your thing. The addictiveness and quickness of each Road to the Show game encourages you to play multiple games in a row, especially because this year, an entire series can be played without ever going back to the menu as long as you’re playing against the same opponent and in the same ballpark. Even if you want to upgrade your player, the training screen is available without needing to load a new page.  The valuable time that used to be spent staring at loading screens in MLB 15 The Show was spent actually playing MLB The Show 16.   Likewise, The Show 16’s franchise mode is deeper, and consequently, better than ever. Individual players are now ruled by a morale system which alters their overall rating based on a number of realistic factors. The astonishing amount of information that’s now available consistently made me feel like I was making informed decisions when making trades and lineup changes. For example, the way a player feels about his team role can range from happy when batting cleanup, to angry if he’s downgraded to eighth in the lineup. When a player is angry his overall rating takes a hit, making my managerial decisions even more thoughtful and complex. Other factors affect player morale as well, such as contracts, team performance, and distance from birthplace. The same bits of emotional information becomes especially useful during contract negotiations. Even if the aforementioned changes weren’t enough to lure me down the rabbit hole, the ridiculous level of stat tracking certainly gave me a nudge. Every statistic you can think of, from batting average against lefties to wins above replacement, is recorded. While other modes have been meaningfully, yet mildly adjusted and expanded, the virtual card-collecting mode, Diamond Dynasty, has been vastly improved upon. Most of the features that were previously featured are still available: collecting cards to fill out your roster, creating a logo and uniform from scratch, and using a created player to round out your team.  You’re only allowed to lose twice before your team is disbanded. On top of that are two new modes. The first – and best – is Battle Royale, The Show’s take on Madden’s Draft Champions mode in which you start by drafting a temporary team and try to win as many intensely contested online head-to-head matches as possible. Drafts go for 25 rounds, each of which allows you to pick one of the randomly selected players available. The catch, to ensure a competitive balance, is that you’re only allowed to select a predetermined amount of players from each rating level. This forced me to stop and make critical decisions about who I wanted to select in each of the higher ranked rounds. To make games quick and easy, each one is only three innings long. But to keep baseball strategy intact, pitchers will tire much more quickly to compensate for the condensed time. Increasingly valuable rewards, in the form of new cards you get to keep, are earned by winning. You’re only allowed to lose twice before your team is disbanded, and in order to join in the first place you’re required to buy-in using in-game currency. These factors led me to become incredibly invested in my teams, despite the fact that they’re temporary, and that makes Battle Royale the best way to play MLB The Show 16. Conquest mode builds a turn-based strategy game in which you wager the size of your fanbase on the outcome of a single-player game to determine the difficulty, and isn’t as successful.  Conquest is just a bit too convoluted, and ended up feeling like a bunch of unnecessary steps I had to make between games. It failed to steal much of my time away from the other fantastic modes. Simply put, MLB The Show 16 is the best baseball game available on any current-gen console. It looks, plays, and feels amazing, offering many ways to play the great American pastime. Franchise and Road to the Show modes have made incremental but impressive improvements, while Diamond Dynasty offers entirely new ways to play. Not every mode works, but it’s encouraging to see such a radical new mix of gameplay.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	 When IGN reviewed Heavy Rain on PS3 back in 2010, we gave it a score of 9, which translates to “amazing”. Here’s what we said then: “Heavy Rain is a hell of an experience. Its controversial control scheme actually works really well in allowing the fantastic story to dictate how events play out, and many of the game's scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat. It starts slow and the presentation isn't perfect, but the character development, dialog and story twists will hook you like few games can. Heavy Rain is not to be missed.” Six years later, Quantic Dream’s interactive drama has landed on the PlayStation 4, sporting a very attractive visual upgrade. The PS4 port has ironed out the original’s screen-tearing, while 1080p visuals now run at a consistent 30fps, making it the best version of Heavy Rain available. However, Heavy Rain’s control scheme has not aged well, and while its story remains an entertaining B-grade oddity, poor characterisation and terrible voice-acting are less forgivable in 2016.  Of everything, its performances have dated most obviously. In the wake of games with subtle, nimble performances like The Last of Us and Firewatch, Heavy Rain’s strained, not-quite-American voice acting clangs harshly on fresh ears. It isn’t helped by frequently stiffly written dialogue and half-sketched characters: while private detective Scott Shelby is charming in a cliched ‘heart-of-gold’ kind of way, Ethan and Madison, our ‘heroes,’ are paper thin and robotic. Considering their lack of chemistry or even the most rudimentary rapport, their quick-time controlled sex scene is unintentionally hilarious. Heavy Rain still gallops along at a great pace, though. While its whodunnit story is wildly nonsensical (that heel-turn remains bizarre), its mix of thrilling action, hard-boiled detective schlock and James Wan-esque horror is heady and fun. More, I was as invested in its outcome as I was the first time I played it, knowing that the choices I made in-game affected Heavy Rain’s conclusion so brutally.  Its rudimentary controls are less charming. Holding down R2 to move felt odd - especially considering the left thumb-stick is mostly ignored - and constantly shifting camera angles often sent my character in a different direction to the one I intended. I found myself walking around in circles and moving into furniture a lot; not great during the moments in Heavy Rain when time was working against me. On the other hand, Heavy Rain’s quick-time events hold up. I’m still impressed by its action sequences, where button prompts grew increasingly frantic to evoke a real sense of tension, and the finger-twisting involved in some of its more gristly moments work wonderfully within their context. And it really does look gorgeous on the PlayStation 4. Textures - particularly on faces - have gained new depth, shadows are richer, reflections more visible, and the eponymous rain itself looks, well, heavier. It’s a stunning presentation that should hold its head high among current-generation games. Although its clunky controls and inconsistent voice acting dates Heavy Rain, it still remains enjoyable (if mad) B-grade sholock. A stunning visual upgrade on the PlayStation 4 makes this the version to grab if you’re new to developer Quantic Dream’s games, and existing fans should find enjoyment in a richer aesthetic this time around.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	 It’s hard to imagine any other modern first-person shooter series being able to make a 12,000 year trip back in time and arrive there with its identity still intact, but Far Cry Primal has made it work. The series’ now familiar one-man-versus-a-savage-frontier shtick has survived the transition admirably and Primal remains packed with many of the same great gameplay loops that have come to define the franchise, just with a primitive twist. Primal’s prehistoric, low-tech version of the Far Cry experience feels surprisingly authentic thanks to the game’s completely bespoke language (the simple dialogue is conveyed entirely with subtitles), its large, convincing environment, and its great character design. It’s overflowing with brutal and satisfying close-quarters combat, and the new ability to tame wild beasts also adds a welcome additional layer of tactical choice to assaults on the enemy. It’s undermined, however, by a startlingly basic plot, some disappointingly uncharismatic villains, and often bland mission objectives. The result is a lengthy and competent game with plenty to discover and conquer, but one that unfortunately contains far fewer memorable moments than its forebears.  Far Cry Primal’s 10,000 BCE Stone Age setting takes us back into human prehistory, casting us as a hunter called Takkar, who's part of a fractured tribe known as the Wenja. We also know he has a beard because, well, you can see it in his little icon on the in-game map screen. Unfortunately, that’s more or less all we ever learn about Takkar and, as such, he isn’t an especially engaging or interesting protagonist. Of course, one of Far Cry’s real fortes is its ability (particularly in more recent instalments) to make up for its ho-hum leads with some truly scene-stealing antagonists, like Far Cry 4’s sadistic Pagan Min or, better still, Far Cry 3’s frighteningly unpredictable Vaas. Regrettably Primal falls flat here too; neither of Primal’s main villains are a patch on a character like Vaas. A considerable letdown for a series that’s carved out a reputation for fascinating and nuanced bad guys.   Takkar's goal is to help establish the Wenja as the dominant tribe in the game’s large world, Oros, which is a mixture of rolling plains, lush forests, and inhospitable ice. To achieve victory over two separate enemy tribes (the Udam and the Izila) Takkar must work alongside several allies to gain the abilities he needs to defeat the leader of each tribe. Unfortunately this elevator pitch is also the entire plot synopsis, because that’s pretty much all there is to Primal. Ubisoft has made a move away from Far Cry’s traditionally more linear storytelling but at a hefty cost.  Primal simply hums along sedately until culminating in a pair of standard-issue boss fights It took me around 20 hours to get through Primal’s main campaign and just some of the available side quests, and the story does retain Far Cry’s now-signature supernatural flourishes, but it lacks any real twists, intrigue, rollicking set-pieces, drama, or depth. Primal simply hums along sedately until culminating in a pair of standard-issue boss fights. Supporting characters feel largely absent beyond their handful of associated missions and have very little to do with Takkar outside of cutscenes. It’s a shame we don’t see much of them over the game’s duration because I quite like the secondary cast; from the one-eyed guy who expresses his brotherly respect via swift headbutts, to the one-armed bloke who I suspect peed on me just so he could choose my nickname. Even the clearly traumatised woman with the ear fetish grew on me. They’ll happily join your village and mooch living quarters built from your hard-earned booty, but don’t expect to see them out in the wild helping you when things get dire.  The detailed character design and costumes on these allies is uniformly excellent, though, and they’re covered in cracking facepaint and nasty scars and adorned with various furs, bones, and sticks. Their performances are good too in the context of Primal’s credible, ancient feel. Well, all except for the jarringly odd Evel Knievel caveman who appears to have strolled directly off the set of a secret sequel to Encino Man. I know he’s a nod to Far Cry regular Hurk, and I appreciate the comic relief, but the thick American accent may be jumping the sabre-toothed shark.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/16/street-fighter-5-review-repromo	 Finding the right mix of old-guard fighting game fundamentals and newer, more modern takes on the genre is no small task, but Street Fighter 5 handles that balancing act with grace and style. Having an air-tight, old-fashioned ground game is every bit as important here as leveraging the dirty tricks made possible by the new V-System, leaving room for both mechanical and tactical mastery. But I expected developer Capcom to knock it out of the park when punch came to kick; what I didn’t expect was that so many key and standard features would be absent on launch day. When compared to the features that other modern-day fighting games offer, Street Fighter 5 leaves a lot of strange holes in its defense.  Street Fighter 5 takes the tried-and-true fundamentals the franchise has cultivated over two decades and bakes in a trio of excellent all-new features that alter the ebb and flow of matches considerably from Street Fighter 4. It starts with the V-Skill, a free-to-use action that differs from character to character. From Birdie nibbling on a snack and leaving the rest for his opponent to deal with, to Necalli’s relentless ground pound, which can force opponents to rush in close where he wants them, every V-Skill provides an interesting tactical advantage for me to leverage.   And leverage it you must, because aside from taking damage, properly using your V-Skill is the only way to charge up your V-Trigger; another powerful new tool that again, is unique to each character. They can be as simple as a single, powerful move like Vega’s (which makes a great whiff punish, by the way), a combo extender like Ken’s, or even a temporary power-up like Chun Li’s, which adds multiple hits to most of her normal attacks. As a whole, the V-System is a brilliant replacement for Street Fighter 4’s Ultra meter. It rewards your understanding of one unique ability by granting you access to another, which itself requires thought to use effectively with each character in the cast.  And what a cast it is. Eight iconic franchise mainstays, four long-absent fan favorites, and four newcomers make for a great mix. Some of the perennials feel familiar but with sweet new twists, courtesy of the V-System. Dhalsim embodies this ideal. His V-Skill allows him to halt his jump mid-arc and hover in place, readjusting left or right and cancelling out with any aerial move at a whim. Where an airborne Dhalsim was once a target, this opens him up to threaten from angles he previously couldn’t, or to escape situations in which he might normally have been trapped. It makes him a much trickier, more interesting character to play as and against. The best thing I can say about the cast is that I kind of want to play everyone, even characters I’ve never given a second glance to in 20 years of playing Street Fighter.  Others, like Vega, have been dramatically overhauled with new moves and mechanics that make them feel exciting to play and learn again. The Spanish matador can now switch between fighting with or without his signature claw. With it, his pokes are slower, but gain range and damage. Once he takes it off his normal attacks come out much faster, new combo routes open up, and he gains a command grab to boot, making him much better at brawling up close and maximizing damage on every opening. Understanding which stance to lean on in different match ups is essential, and since all his inputs have gone from charges to motions, he can be played more actively than reactively. The new kids on the block are all a joy to use as well. Shadaloo lieutenant F.A.N.G is all about flamboyance and a flustering keepaway game. He just fills the screen with stuff, controlling huge swathes of space with both his normal and special moves. Necalli is just a savage, bullying opponents with heavy block-stun inducing punches and foot-stomps. With the ability to close gaps rapidly, and augment his myriad mobility options with the power of wind, Rashid can play balls-out like a nut, but he has some great pokes and a rounded toolset that allow him to play safe and solid if his gimmicks stop working out. Still, the best thing I can say about the cast is that I kind of want to play everyone, even characters like Ken, Chun, and Sim – characters I’ve never given a second glance to in 20 years of playing Street Fighter.  Not only is the cast strong from top to bottom, but they’re operating on a far more level playing field than before. Capcom has done a ton of fine tuning in Street Fighter 5 to eliminate the “vortex” style offenses that dominated Street Fighter 4, and to ensure that the ground game couldn’t just be opted out of with easy-to-use defensive options. With the focus mechanic gone, and back-dashes no longer granting invulnerability, it’s entirely possible to dominate opponents with nothing but superior timing and spacing. This is a windfall for characters like Chun Li, Karin, and Cammy, whose nimble walk speeds and strong normals allow them to poke, prod, and oppress their foes if played properly. In this way, Street Fighter 5 is a welcome return to an older time, where having a strong ground game was rightfully rewarded. It doesn’t end there...
Jakejames Lugo	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	 I both love and hate Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4. As a fan of the anime and manga, I expected lots of intense action from what’s been presented as the final game of the Ultimate Ninja Storm series, and to its credit, Storm 4 delivers. The characters and over-the-top battles look and feel great, and the story pays off in a satisfying way. On the other hand, even the best combat system in the world would be wasted if there are no worthy opponents to be found.  Watch the first 16 minutes of gameplay above.  What I like most is the ability to switch between your active fighter and two support characters on the fly. That's not to say that this combat is the best, but it is pretty strong. Fights are fast and fierce, and are treated like major events by way of plenty of cinematic camera angles and powerful jutsu moves at your disposal. The controls are simple and the most responsive of the Storm games to date. What I liked most, however, was the ability to switch between your active fighter and two support characters on the fly by moving the right analog stick. This let me use my characters for both active and support roles, and didn’t limit them to one task in a fight. In one battle, I was able launch a series of punches with Hinata before calling for an assist from Naruto to deal more damage, and then switching to Hashirama Senju to recharge my energy fast for a  follow-up jutsu attack.   That strategy isn’t always needed, though, because the AI opponents have a bad habit of falling into a repetitive cycle of constantly evading and spamming ranged attacks. This happened to me many times and became incredibly annoying, especially when I couldn’t get an attack off without taking a kunai to the face. That’s made even worse by the way some areas of the Story Mode give the computer a huge edge in battle by increasing their damage, which can make things feel very cheap and unfair.   See the Official Secret Techniques trailer above.  The level of polish in the storytelling is disappointing. I was also let down by the presentation of the brief, five to six-hour story mode, which at the beginning promises epic battles and interactive scenes that the Storm series is known for. But just 15 minutes into it, I was shown long montage cutscenes with motion-comic style effects instead of anime clips. It wasn’t until later in the story that Storm 4 switches to in-game cutscenes, which look much better than the static images. Even then, however, the lip syncing to the audio is off on both the Japanese and English audio tracks, which create some awkward moments. It’s disappointing that the level of storytelling polish isn’t up to the standard I’d expected. At least the end of Story Mode hints at what may come next for Naruto and his friends in an exciting way.   After that comes the follow-up Adventure Mode, an epilogue that takes place immediately after the events of Story Mode. However, it acts more like an obligatory excuse to reminisce about key events from the early parts of the series, such as Naruto’s first battles with Sasuke and the Chunin Exams. With more of the same AI troubles and nothing new to see by way of the story, it feels like it can be skipped entirely without missing anything.   Watch Gaara vs Rock Lee above. Multiplayer in Storm 4 is both a hit and a miss. Local matches are great and have a bunch of different competitive modes to explore, along with 61 playable characters with varying attacks, jutsu moves, and alternate costumes. Online multiplayer, however, can be frustrating with its connection issues, where I found it nearly impossible to find a game, much less a stable matchup. Almost every match suffered from massive input lag or stuttering that rendered them pretty much unplayable. Naruto Shippuden: Ultimate Ninja Storm 4 refines the gameplay to the absolute best of the series and offers a large roster of playable characters. Unfortunately, it squanders all of that potential with a short and poorly presented campaign fought against buggy AI, a forgettable Adventure Mode and online matches that are plagued with connectivity problems. The Ultimate Ninja Storm series sadly does not end on a high note.
Alanah Pearce	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	 Not to be confused with the excellent LEGO Marvel Superheroes, LEGO Marvel’s Avengers is a Marvel Cinematic Universe-specific take on the familiar LEGO game formula, which has mostly led to a game littered with obvious, unfortunate restrictions that end up making this one of the weakest of the many LEGO games.   Above: Watch the first 15 minutes of the PS4 version.  The plot's so mixed up and out of order it’s likely to confuse. The plot is perhaps the most obvious problem, due to the way it frantically jumps between scenes from The Avengers, Avengers: Age of Ultron, Captain America: The First Avenger, Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Rather than being an interesting take on the MCU chronology, it’s so mixed up and out of order it’s likely to confuse anyone who hasn’t watched all of those films fairly recently. It feels a lot more like a series of uncoordinated vignettes than the high-quality, cohesive package we’ve come to expect from LEGO games. Ignoring that mess, the occasional crashes, and a tedious puzzle minigame that pops up far too often, LEGO Marvel’s Avengers is still a fairly decent third-person action-adventure that mostly focuses on fairly light, simple combat and some environmental puzzle solving, usually using abilities from specific characters to flick switches, pull levers, and open locked doors. If you’ve ever played a LEGO game before, you know the drill.  Above: Watch the launch trailer.  You’ll execute a devastating, engaging, and often fairly funny team combo move. The one good innovation here is the cinematic team combos, showcased in the first mission, an impressive recreation of the opening scene from The Avengers. Where previously most combat in the LEGO games has been a series of mashing buttons to get through to the next, equally-blocky bad guy, LEGO Avengers introduces more involving, specifically timed QTE-like sequences. Here, an enemy will have a button prompt above their head and, if you press it at the right time (and the window is generous), you’ll execute a nicely animated combo move. Do this while you’re near a co-op partner and you’ll execute a devastating, engaging, and often fairly funny team combo move, with animations that vary depending on the two characters involved. Hulk ends up punching Thor at the end of theirs, for one.   The environments in that first level, and a strange assortment of others - but not all of them - are also the most realistic looking, dense places we’ve seen so far in any LEGO game. The various open-world ‘hubs’ - Manhattan, Asgard, Sokovia, Washington D.C., Barton’s Farm, S.H.I.E.L.D. Base and Malibu - are all remarkably well-fleshed out, familiar locations that are a delight to simply wander around, but they’re also littered with collectibles and side-quests. In any of these hubs, you can pull up a list of one of the 200+ playable characters and pick any that you’ve unlocked to traverse the environments with - Quicksilver is particularly good to use in Manhattan, for example, considering it’s so big and he’s so fast. Almost everything in LEGO Marvel’s Avengers is co-op friendly, too - even the open world and the side-quests within them can be played by two players at once, both doing totally different things (including separate side quests), with dynamic or a horizontally fixed split-screen. This means you can unlock extra characters and character variations twice as fast.    In some scenes one player is almost completely useless. Some of the story missions aren’t quite the same, though, since of the more epic battles from the films - like Hulk versus Iron Man’s Hulk Buster - has the second player doing almost nothing, waiting for the first to finish fighting the Hulk. Because of a stubborn adherence to movie accuracy there are a surprising amount of sequences like this, where one player is almost completely useless, in a way that takes a lot of the fun out of those co-op experiences. It’s not a constant flaw, but, in comparison to previous LEGO games, it stands out. Attempts at keeping the game as close to the movies as possible also affected the audio in unfortunate ways. Lines of dialogue pulled straight from the films and mixed into the game sound really unnatural, and dull compared to some of the newly recorded lines from Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill and Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson. While on paper the idea of using the voices of actors we’ve come to know from the films sounds like it would make the game feel much more authentic, it also means a lot of awkward silences and repetition of lines - they couldn’t record new dialogue, so instead they sometimes don’t say anything at all where it seems like they should. If you like the LEGO game formula, you have a preference for playing solo and you’re a huge fan of MCU, there’s still a lot of value for you in LEGO Marvel’s Avengers, even despite a disjointed plot and annoying audio mixes. If you haven’t played any of the others and you’re thinking about picking up this one, I’d advise starting with just about any other game instead. This the weakest LEGO game I’ve played thus far, and had me missing games like LEGO Marvel Super Heroes and LEGO Dimensions.

Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	 Update: Darkest Dungeon has been nominated for IGN's 2016 Game of the Year.  Like most fiendish things, Darkest Dungeon appears much simpler and more benign than it is. Its grim but expressive hand-drawn art style, combined with how you only ever see your party of four mismatched adventurers trudge from left to right as the backgrounds scroll by like a demented Hannah Barbera cartoon, might give you the idea there’s not much to it. But once you’ve explored a few of these randomized dungeons and almost certainly seen several of your fragile characters brutally killed or driven insane, it’s revealed as an intimidatingly deep, tense, and intentionally opaque turn-based tactical game that’s dripping with character.   Above: watch us try not to die. What strikes me most is how the rampant and merciless randomness always keeps me off balance, struggling to stay alive. It comes in both the usual accuracy percentages for various attacks and dodges, but also unexpected and unusual places - even the turn order is mixed up by behind-the-scenes dice rolls. So you’re never quite sure, for example, if your Vestal healer will be able to patch up your Crusader tank before the enemy can deal a killing blow, permanently removing that character and all his progress from your roster. By robbing you of the certainty and predictability you usually see in a turn-based tactics game of this nature, Darkest Dungeon creates tense and terrifying battles where you’re never sure what’ll happen next.    It’s all fantastically grim and delivered with great gravitas. The thrill of victory and the agony of defeat are intensified by outstanding narration that frequently interjects with grim warnings and exclamations in response to events like critical hits or discovering potentially dangerous loot. The deep-voiced speaker, who portrays an ancestor of yours who first unearthed the dungeons before recognizing his folly, also doles out bits of loose, Lovecraftian story more as flavor than a meaningful plot. Mostly when beginning boss-level dungeons, he’ll give some background on how each unholy horror came to be and what role they played in his own mad quest, and it’s all fantastically grim and delivered with great gravitas. Battles are great to watch, too. Using just a few frames of animation and some parallax movement, Darkest Dungeon conveys action and excitement, and the monster designs are varied and often creative. Battle is fought against a wide variety of bandits, skeleton warriors, fish men, filthy pig monsters, Eldritch horrors, and all manner of creatively designed monstrosities in between. The grotesque bosses are especially noteworthy for their unique and powerful abilities, which include a transforming lump of flesh and a Siren that temporarily seduces one of your party to her side.   Knowing when to fold a bad hand and retreat is as important as knowing how to play a good one. It might feel unfair at times - because it is - but that’s where the tension comes from. It would be unforgivable for a game to put us in no-win situations with catastrophic consequences that can wipe away hours of progress, but Darkest Dungeon sidesteps that problem by giving us an eject button that allows you to bail out of a run that’s going south at nearly any time (it does have a chance to fail, like everything else), even in combat, and save your surviving characters at the cost of forfeiting your mission rewards. Like in poker, knowing when to fold a bad hand and retreat is as important as knowing how to play a good one.   So it’s all about maximizing your odds of survival in these unforgiving places, though that’s easier said than done. It’s impressive how many different factors you have to consider when putting together a four-member team from the 14 distinctly different classes that not only has complementary abilities, but also taking care that no member is affected by weaknesses that might make them vulnerable to the perils of a particular dungeon run. The first complex thing you have to consider is that each character has seven skills, such as the Highwayman’s bleed-inflicting Open Vein or the Grave Robber’s blight-loaded Poison Dart. You can only have four equipped at a time, and unlocking and upgrading each skill individually represents a considerable investment of resources. This forces you to specialize characters for specific roles, such as front-line melee or back-row support, or to spread your abilities thinly across the positional slots. Each class’s ability set is flexible enough that most characters can serve multiple roles, which adds a lot of diversity to possible builds.  Above: gameplay in the Weald dungeon. But wait, there’s more: each character’s placement in the four-character lineup affects which skills can be used. For instance, Poison Dart can only be used if the Grave Robber is in slots three or four, Open Vein can only be used from slots one, two or three, but only against enemies in slots one or two. That not only necessitates careful arrangement of your party, but it means that an enemy can cast an ability that can knock you out of position and disable some of your most potent abilities, forcing you to spend turns shuffling back where you need to be. And of course, you can do the same to them, which can define entire strategies against certain enemies.  Certain items can definitely inspire me to rebuild a character around a certain skill. On top of that you have to worry about equipping loot to boost character stats. It’s a little bland, in that items are rarely potent enough to grant new spins on existing abilities, but certain items can definitely inspire me to rebuild a character around a certain skill, such as a shield that granted my normally forward-facing Man-at-Arms major defensive bonuses, but only if he sat in position four, where he couldn’t use any of his offensive skills but could buff his teammates considerably, and even take hits for them.  Keeping track of all your characters is a big task. Then there are quirks, which can positively or negatively impact a hero’s effectiveness in certain dungeons, or against certain enemies, or cause them to independently perform actions, including stealing any money you see in the case of Kleptomania, and each hero can have up to five positive and five negative traits. Keeping track of them all – your stable can hold up to 25 of them at once – is a big task.
Rob Zacny	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review	" Luck is a fickle mistress, both for people who play games and people who make them. A little luck in the right places and a game can be tense, gripping, and delightfully unpredictable! But let Lady Luck have things all her own way, and suddenly you've got something that feels random, cruel, and maybe even a little mean-spirited. Something like Tharsis.  Watch Justin and Daemon fail at Tharsis above. Tharsis takes place on a star-crossed mission to Mars where, immediately after the tutorial, the spaceship is shattered by a meteorite, two of the crew are killed, and all the food is destroyed. With a ship falling apart around them, the four surviving astronauts try to patch failing ship modules long enough to reach Mars. It's a good setup, though the interstitial cutscenes will get old fast as the try-fail-repeat patterns of Tharsis begin to take their toll.    The resource-allocation aspect of Tharsis its strongest point. At the start of each turn, new problems strike different modules of your ship, and if they aren't fixed, they will inflict a different kind of harm on your ship or your crew. A failing flight control system could threaten your ship's hull with three points of damage, and if your hull reaches zero it's game over. On the other hand, a fire in the medical bay might do two points of health damage to every crewmember on board your ship, and as crewmembers die, completing the mission becomes much harder (if not impossible). Just choosing which problem to solve would be hard enough, especially as events carry over from turn to turn if you don't fix them, but there are some other priorities to consider that make the resource-allocation aspect of Tharsis its strongest point.  Watch the Tharsis announcement trailer above. Each module has unique abilities that can help out your crew and better prepare them for problems down the road. Roll three of a kind in the greenhouse module and you will have food to feed your astronauts, which grants them extra dice with which to solve problems. Roll two of a kind in the medical bay and the astronaut working there will be fully healed. On top of that, a module can't have more than one thing wrong with it at a time, so sometimes it's easier to leave a minor problem in place because something worse might happen if you fix it. All these factors create a lot of satisfying opportunities for planning and prediction, and if Tharsis weren't such a fundamentally sadistic game, it could’ve been a lot of fun to manage all these competing priorities.  Tharsis just seems to say, ""You made some good calls, but now you lose."" The problem is that there are times that Tharsis just seems to say, ""You made some good calls, but now you lose."" I've had quite a few games where things were going surprisingly well: my crew were mostly healthy, my ship's hull was in okay shape, and I only had one minor problem dealing some easily handled damage each turn. Then, at the start of the new turn, Tharsis would toss up a set of unbelievably bad events that instantly dealt enough potential damage to destroy my ship, and then make them almost impossible to fix in time to survive to the next turn… when a new round of disasters would strike and start piling on more harm to my beleaguered crew.   The way you attempt to solve all these problems is by rolling some lovingly animated virtual dice. They make a weighty sound as they roll around on the screen, and move with a slight slow-motion effect that shows them teetering between the number you need and the number that dooms you. Each roll becomes a dramatic event as you wait to see whether disaster or a miracle will strike. The decision-making comes about as you send crew members, each with their own pool of up to five six-sided dice, into modules to repair them. Each malfunction on the ship has a target number, reduced by allocating dice to it. So if the medical bay is starting to fill with smoke and the target number is 22, and your mechanic rolls a five, three, and six, you could reduce that target number all the way down to eight. It’s easy enough to understand. But there's another catch – a final punch to the kidneys from Tharsis. Each problem also creates the potential for bad things to happen on your crew member's roll. An example: I had an event that dealt two points of hull damage each turn, with a target number of 22. Not such a big deal to fix… except that on rolls of four, five, and six my crew members would be injured or their dice destroyed. So you can have multiple events going on at once where full half your dice rolls results in bad things happening, and sometimes it's the good rolls that are the most punishing. In this instance, only rolls that could save me would also doom me. Dice, by the way, don't replenish between turns unless you feed your crew, which is pretty hard to do when you have problems breaking out all over your ship. Hard, that is, unless you eat dead (or freshly killed!) crew members, which fully replenishes your dice pool but also freaks out your surviving astronauts.    When things did go well, I felt like I'd gotten lucky rather than I'd done something clever. That's why it so often felt like Tharsis was just burying me in unsolvable problems, and all the decisions of the past three or four turns were meaningless because a giant set of ""screw you""s were on their way the entire time. This also means success are less satisfying. When things did go well, I felt like I'd gotten lucky rather than I'd done something clever. Sometimes terrible things happened and I couldn't do anything about them. Sometimes they didn't, and things were fine without much input required. I could skew the odds a bit, but nowhere near enough to affect what Tharsis' random events did. Any luck-based game will occasionally create moments where defeat feels cruel and arbitrary. I play a lot of wargames on PC and tabletop, and there's nothing worse than watching your best tank get blown sky-high because your opponent hit a one-in-50 shot with a bazooka from halfway across the map. But that's just one event in a system whose outcomes are still mostly the product of decision making. Tharsis can never stop reminding you that you don't have control over its interstellar disaster, just the illusion of it. Every time I watched my ship fall apart, and every time I watched new events propagate across the ship that were completely impossible to stop, I felt like, win-or-lose, Tharsis was having all the fun."
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	 If the success of last year’s surprise hit, Rocket League, is any indication, it’s clear that there’s still life in the competitive multiplayer car game arena. Hardware: Rivals attempts to capture some of that same lightning in its bottle, with missiles rather than oversized soccer balls. But after only a few minutes, I realized Hardware: Rivals was out of its league.   Watch the Hardware: Rivals Launch Trailer above. Just like its predecessor (2002’s Hardware: Online Arena for PlayStation 2) Hardware: Rivals is a 10-player, team-based vehicular combat game similar to the Twisted Metal series, but without the over-the-top attitude that makes those games memorable. And if you’ve ever played any vehicular combat game, there won’t be any surprises or innovations for you here. Offering a sleek and sharp interface, Hardware: Rivals is easy to navigate and get directly into the action, a strength which can’t be overlooked in an online multiplayer-only game. However, there are only four basic game modes, none of which is all that impressive: deathmatch, team deathmatch, team domination, and team elimination. Special timed events are planned for the future, but were not live at the time of review.    Aiming those weapons while driving is difficult. Hardware: Rivals is also lacking in vehicular variety, with only four to choose from: two tanks and two buggies. And while each vehicle handles just as you’d expect, and the difference between the two types is large enough to demand different tactics, the awkward controls make them feel unresponsive and unsatisfying. The slower, lumbering tanks, for instance, feel incredibly clunky, but they can soak up a lot of damage, giving you the time to aim its slower, but more powerful main weapon. On the other hand, the buggies are fast and nimble enough to reach hard-to-get-to places, but they’re more vulnerable and have a weaker main weapon. Aiming those weapons while driving is difficult, because while Hardware uses the standard R2 to accelerate and L2 to brake, for some reason the two weapons are mapped to R1 and L1. Since shooting while driving is the whole point, I was forced to handle the controller in an uncomfortable claw grip. In addition to main weapons, power ups are scattered throughout each of the maps - largely run-of-the-mill stuff like homing missiles, lasers, and disabling EMP blasts. Homing missiles are only interesting in that they’re one-shot kills, but at the same time they feel overpowered and require next to no skill to use effectively. My biggest frustration with power-ups was only being able to carry one at a time, which led to situations where my lock-on missile would accidentally be replaced by a weaker weapon that I accidentally drove over. There are also hidden weapons, unique to each of the four forgettable stages. If you’re able to find it, a short countdown will start and then annihilate anyone on the map that couldn’t get to cover in time. It feels sort of tacked on, yet can swing the momentum one way or another in a close battle. In a sense that’s good, as it keeps things unpredictable and allows big comebacks, but it does it in a way that feels unearned.  Perks  just weren’t enough to keep me playing for the sake of unlocking them once I’d gotten tired of the basic gameplay. Every match you complete gives you XP, which allows you to level up, earning upgrades and cosmetic items for your vehicles and characters. But perks like locking onto opponents faster, unlocking new skins, or having better visibility on the map just weren’t enough to keep me playing for the sake of unlocking them once I’d gotten tired of the basic gameplay. In terms of Hardware: Rivals’ look and feel, there isn’t much to write home about. The pleasant, colorful cell-shaded art style does an adequate job of masking muddy textures and bland scenery, but the sound quality is the obvious weak link. Generic and monotonous electronic music fades into the background, begging to be ignored. After a kill, your character will sometimes smack talk the other team, but it’s scarce and without personality. Even firing weapons and destroying vehicles sounds flat, making each kill feel that much more anticlimactic. The novelty of driving around in this tiny selection of tanks and buggies while shooting at other players wears thin pretty quickly. The lack of any original modes or meaningful progression prevents Hardware: Rivals from having any chance at longevity. Aside from the awkward controls, everything works well enough, but nothing is memorable or satisfying.
Tristan Ogilvie	http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	 Long before your lounge room became an increasingly cluttered stage space for plastic instruments there was Amplitude, Harmonix’s second stab at rhythm-action that would help lay the foundation for a genre that would quickly become a phenomenon. This crowd-funded remake hits most of the right notes as far as the twitchy controller tap-dancing gameplay is concerned, but a soundtrack lacking in musical diversity and a limited selection of modes narrows both its appeal and lifespan.   The original Amplitude is a musical mash-up of Simon Says and plate-spinning, and that hasn’t changed for this 2016 remake. You’re still challenged to switch between the different tracks of a song, from drums to synths to guitars to vocals, to nail the three-button-based note sequences in each to trigger them in the mix and keep your score streak going.  I started worrying less about the twisting note highways and more about my own cramping carpal tunnels. Sustaining the groove this time around is a little more streamlined, thanks to the welcome addition of a ‘streak seek’ mechanic that lets you skip over adjacent tracks on your way to the next available sequence. Although you can still manually move from track to track, I found the use of the streak seek essential to maintaining my multiplier and racking up a decent score. That’s not to say that Amplitude is too easy, and in fact as I progressed to the higher difficulty settings I started worrying less about the twisting note highways and more about my own cramping carpal tunnels. Veterans of the original game can rest assured; Amplitude is capable of presenting as stiff a challenge to your sense of rhythm and digital dexterity as ever.   Which is a good thing, since increasing the difficulty is one of the only ways to prolong Amplitude’s lifespan. The remix mode and online multiplayer from the original are absent from this remake, and the included soundtrack lacks any big names as it skews heavily towards electronica, most of which was created in-house at Harmonix. To be fair the purpose-built bleeps and bloops do suit the neon-soaked psychedelia of Amplitude’s aesthetic, but the songs themselves are mostly forgettable. 15 of them form the backbone of the ‘concept album’ campaign mode, an interesting albeit short-lived journey along the neural pathways of a comatose patient. The majority of these tunes blend into each other and lack any real hooks; after hours spent playing, I’m struggling to remember any of them now that I’ve put the controller down, which dulls any impulse I have to pick it back up again. There are four 'Beat Blaster' ships to choose from, each with the exact same abilities. The rest of the 30 songs are mostly borrowed from indie games such as Transistor and Skullgirls, or provided by indie artists like Jim Guthrie and George & Jonathan. There are a few standouts – Freezepop’s Phantoms is a personal favourite – but as a collection it just isn’t on par with the more eclectic tracklist of the original game, which spanned David Bowie to Blink-182 and Slipknot to Run-DMC. Still, if you do dig the tunes on offer and you have a few like-minded friends around, Amplitude can be played by four players in either individual or team-based score attack modes. Local multiplayer can serve up some frantic fun, particularly with the inclusion of an eject power-up that launches an opponent right off their track. However, the curious inability to set individual player difficulty settings creates somewhat of an imbalance when you have seasoned hands playing alongside newcomers, lessening its overall appeal as a party game. Despite its improved HD veneer and tweaked controls, I just didn’t find the Amplitude of 2016 to be as addictive or long-lasting an experience as the Amplitude of 2003. I had some fun with it for as long as it took to play through its hypnotic campaign and unlock all its tracks in the quickplay mode, but the samey soundtrack and meagre selection of modes meant that I had little motivation to return to it thereafter. Committed high score-chasers will probably stick around in an effort to top the online leaderboards since the challenge is most certainly still there, but for everyone else Amplitude will likely feel like a commendable cover of a classic, but a mere cover all the same.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	" Dirt Rally is more than just the best Codemasters rally game to date; it’s arguably the best racing game Codemasters has produced in at least a decade. Perhaps ever. It’s certainly the best crack at a hard-core rally game since 2004’s heavily-worshiped Richard Burns Rally from Warthog Games. It’s brilliant. Dirt Rally sheds the showmanship of past instalments and shifts the series back to pure, unforgiving rallying. There’s no rewind ability and no quarter given by the game’s opponents. Dirt Rally doesn’t care if you’re too slow. It’s not going to give you a pat on the bum and a free ride to first place if you can’t keep up. To rule Dirt Rally you need to be fast, you need to be focused, and you need to be fearless.  When I began playing Dirt Rally I simply wasn’t quick enough. I was overly cautious and still coming to grips with the handling. I was losing time on every sector. At best I was scraping into top four finishes. At worst I was spearing off stages and suffering huge time penalties that sent me plummeting down the timesheets. The steep learning curve may prove frustrating for some players; the deliberate lack of Codemasters’ signature ‘Flashback’ crutch is an important way of punishing mistakes and placing realistic pressure on players but the lack of any guided, rally school training facility may alienate less-experienced users. Codemasters has added a wad of video tutorials to Dirt Rally alongside the console release, however, and each one goes in-depth with a range of rally driving techniques. But it should begin to click. I soon began to better understand the limits of my car and just how close it could be pushed to the edge. I tried being slightly more experimental with my set-ups, seeking to eek a few more tenths from the clock. As my comprehension of the pace notes developed I became more aggressive in corners, attacking them with increasing confidence, braking later (or not at all), turning in harder, and getting back on the power quicker.   Dirt Rally is rewarding precisely because it makes you work so hard to get results. I vividly remember my first stage win in Dirt Rally because it took me plenty of practice (and a properly blistering run) to earn it. It’s these moments where Dirt Rally is at its most thrilling, fractions of a second ahead of the pack at the last time check, hurtling down a narrow forest corridor, carving around gravel bends, and keenly aware that losing my nerve now will see me slip behind. Losing my lunch, however, is still a possibilty. Dirt Rally’s wheel controls are very satisfying and the force feedback feels drastically better than it did when it debuted in Steam Early Access. I’m playing on a Thrustmaster TX (using the optional TH8A shifter in analogue mode as a handbrake) and the constant wrestle is a huge amount of fun. That said, Codemasters hasn’t ignored gamers who aren’t in a position to splurge on a racing wheel; I also played it using an Xbox One controller and found it more than capable of taming Dirt Rally’s demanding racing. The joypad controls feel refined and responsive and can be further massaged to suit individual preferences by honing the controller sensitivity and linearity settings (on PS4 I found myself knocking the sensitivity down and the linearity up from their default settings). In any case, the handling is fantastic and the feel of balancing a car on the very limit of adhesion (and, in many cases, well beyond it) is tremendously translated. It’s a great looking game too. The vehicles themselves are far more detailed than those in Codemasters’ Grid Autosport (complete with authentic cabins) and the stage design is excellent (with intimate, tree-lined sections opening up into vast vistas). I love the small details too, from the way new mud is plastered over dried mud, to the occasions you’ll spot camera drones darting from behind shrubs to capture a great angle of you shredding up a corner. And the water splash effects? Magnificent. Case in point. Better still is the sound, which I honestly can’t fault. Exhaust notes are a violent symphony of snarls, crackles, and pops. Dirt Rally really nails everything, from the whine of a turbo, or the squeal of protesting brakes. The pace notes too have an incredibly authentic beat to them, feeling unique to each stage rather than a cut and pasted barrage of commands lifted from a virtual soundboard.   There are over 40 cars available, ranging from the 1960s classics to today’s competitors. Aside from a few obvious exceptions Dirt Rally covers most of the sport’s most iconic vehicles. It’s quite a task getting to grips with all of them, too. An antique like the Mini Cooper S is quite forgiving (incredibly light and front wheel drive it claws its way through corners) but it’s no rocket and demands you keep your momentum up and maintain as much speed as possible. On the other hand, Dirt Rally’s modern RallyX cars (with around twice the horsepower of a current WRC car) accelerate like Sidewinder missiles, squatting down on their rear springs as they surge to speeds that will leave your spleen in a different postcode. 0-100km/h in two seconds? Sure, why not? There’s a great deal of variety in the rally locations, ranging from the huge jumps and high speed gravel straights of Finland (easily my favourite location) to the incredibly rough gravel farm tracks of Greece, and from the lush, green countryside of Germany to the icy roads of Sweden, with its stages carved through snow drifts. Dirt Rally’s treatment of snow in particular is excellent; rather than bouncing off it like a solid wall cars will plough through chunks of it as they graze the banks, sending plumes of white powder into the air. In addition to the rally locations there’s also Colorado’s famous Pikes Peak hillclimb course, plus several dedicated RallyX tracks (which provide the game with head-to-head multiplayer). I’ve had a huge amount of fun with the RallyX courses; I really enjoy the format and the strategy involved with deciding when to take the compulsory ‘Joker Lap’ (the circuits all contain one slightly longer detour that all drivers must take once during the race). The racing is entertainingly aggressive and the AI tenacious. The sealed, unsealed, and mixed-surface versions of Pikes Peak are all available. It’s up to players what you choose to primarily focus on during Dirt Rally’s career mode (or in what order you want to tackle these event types) but you’ll need to actually spend your own in-game winnings on the cars you want in order to do so, and this can be a slog. Personally I find Dirt Rally’s career mode suffers as a result of this; I’d expect the driver-for-hire model found in the likes of Grid Autosport or Project CARS would be a better fit for Dirt Rally than the grind-for-cash, collect ’em up approach of games like Gran Turismo. There’s a specific corner during one of the German stages in Dirt Rally where your co-driver will supplement his flurry of warnings with a professional request: “Be brave.”  It’s a slight left kink, framed on both sides by half-buried stones. To be honest I’m not certain what it is about this corner in particular that warrants the added advice – there are plenty of deceptive corners in Dirt Rally you can take faster than you’d expect – but ""be brave"" potently sums up how you need to approach Dirt Rally. Dirt Rally is a brilliant looking and incredible sounding racing sim that feels absolutely outstanding, but it won’t tolerate the timid."
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/batman-arkham-knight-catwomans-revenge-dlc-review	 For Catwoman, revenge is swift. Very swift - this Batman: Arkham Knight DLC took me only a half hour to complete. Catwoman’s Revenge is a mostly fun, self-contained story set in a toy store that The Riddler has converted into a robot factory, and the dark, moody Arkham take on ‘toys’ - if you can call these monstrous figures that - is a genuine delight. It is however, a very slight experience that brings nothing new to Arkham’s world. If you’ve played Arkham Knight and its predecessors, you’ll know Catwoman’s set of skills by now. She can crawl along designated parts of the ceiling, use a whip, and generally move a little faster than Batman in combat. Catwoman’s Revenge makes good use of each, though I wish I’d been able to let her loose in a less confining environment.  With its dark, twisting corridors, dusty teddy bears and sad model planes, ‘Winslow’s Toy Shop’ is a wonderfully twisted, Tim Burton-esque place to look at. It’s just a very small space, made to feel only slightly larger by plenty of underground spots to hide and lots of climbable ceilings. Consequently the first section, which requires Catwoman to stealthily pick off guards, took me no time at all. I was there just long enough to appreciate the gag-heavy NPC dialogue: hired goons in the Arkham games have never been so comically dumb. Once you’re done sneaking around, Catwoman’s Revenge switches gears into more traditional Arkham Knight rhythms, as the Riddler throws wave after wave of robots at you in an electrified arena. The sheer volume of them made this quite a difficult fight at first, but that means it creates lots of opportunity for stringing some fun combos.  It’s a shame that outside of this fight, there’s very little to do in Riddler’s secret factory. There are a handful of collectables and a half-baked puzzle I quickly solved through trial and error, but otherwise it’s disappointingly devoid of Nigma’s usual mind-meddling finesse. The life of Catwoman’s Revenge is extended somewhat through a couple of new AR maps. Though they virtually rehash the beats of its campaign - sneak, then fight on an electrified floor - I had fun fighting against tougher enemies and sentry guns. It's a delight to put Catwoman's skills to use against Arkham's more formidable foes, but the tantalizing taste I was given here just left me hungry for more. Batman Arkham Knight: Catwoman’s Revenge has a wonderfully twisted setting, but an- all-too-brief campaign doesn’t utilize it enough. Like Arkham Knight’s Batgirl DLC before it, this is a blink-and-you’ll-miss-it affair.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	 The Old Hunters is as fitting a title for this self-contained Bloodborne expansion as you might imagine. It’s a spiritual and mechanical return to the old, reliable, tense, and violent patchwork of terrible places that make up this atmospheric and secret-filled world. With a sizable, 15-hour hunk of the same gory experience, it maintains the brutal attitude that defines Bloodborne, set in a new nightmare, against new horrific oddities, and with new grin-inducing weapons and abilities.   This Hunter's Nightmare houses three distinct, sprawling, comfortless environments, that are as visually and thematically unique and fully realized as any area in Bloodborne. The Old Hunters largely takes place in a capsule-world called the Hunter’s Nightmare, a facsimile of Bloodborne’s world that's surprisingly even more stark and forgotten. It's a place where all hunters that succumb to the lust of the hunt eventually go – or something. The story is as vague and cryptic as ever, centered primarily on the curse that began with the first hunters, but The Old Hunters' self-contained plot delves as much into the established lore of the universe as its own story ideas, which are generally creepy and intriguingly peculiar, though not as grand in scale as Bloodborne's larger story of brushes with mind-destroying cosmic deities. This Hunter's Nightmare houses three distinct, sprawling, comfortless environments, that – with the exception of the starting area – are as visually and thematically unique and fully realized as any area in Bloodborne. This realm is fittingly lousy with fallen hunters – and unlike in Bloodborne, most of these dangerous enemies respawn, meaning constant, grueling encounters every step of the way.  But in keeping with the hunter-centric themes, some of the most notorious names of the profession can be summoned for aid in both new and existing fights using the Old Hunters Bell. I beckoned Damian of Mensis to once again take down the cosmic Ebrietas, and I called upon the old Tomb Prospector to help in the deeper Chalice Dungeons. Knowing the place these names have in the lore meant lending a sense of validity to the world when seeing them in the flesh. This emphasis on hunters is paired with the new titanic, sickening, and deadly monsters The Old Hunters introduces to Bloodborne's bestiary. Whether you're facing blood-soaked sacks of decapitated heads, tentacles that whip violently when you get to close, or a towering shark-man that lunges dozens of feet to pick you up and bite down on your torso, there's new stress, fear, and elation to be had in each introduction. The Old Hunters' new beasts are a testament to developer From Software’s continued excellence in creature design.  And yet mechanically, they’re inescapably familiar in form and function to what Bloodborne threw at us. Though undeniably challenging, it’s disappointing that these new encounters are challenging in the same way. Even the few new bosses introduced in The Old Hunters carry a strikingly similar cadence to what we've seen before. Their attacks never truly surprised me, and in at least once instance I was able to kill a boss on the first try due to its near identical look and behavior to the bosses of Bloodborne. The Old Hunters is an expansion that plays it very safe.  Though undeniably challenging, it’s disappointing that these new encounters are challenging in the same way. Fortunately, the lust for coveting new instruments to murder, mangle, pulverize, and pepper with bullets is alive and well in The Old Hunters. Its niche weapons and abilities are as stylish as they are slaughterous and each new discovery rekindles that fleeting, perfect moment of excitement and wonder as to what it’s capable of doing. There’s a dark sense of catharsis in mowing through a crowd with a buzzsaw on a pole, firing a giant explosive artillery shell, beating a hunter to death with the arm of a cosmic deity, or summoning a giant viper to engulf your foes. The Old Hunters is an exercise in finding new ways to harm the horrors that lurk in the darkened corners of the world.  However it's the many secrets in The Old Hunters that are calling me back to it even now. A cryptic phrase, an overly specific item description, or an obscure request: all are potential clues in the vast network of secrets gnawing to be discovered. For example, I found a new set of equipment, read its description, and learned it once belonged to a pair of hunters from an existing area in Bloodborne. On a whim I donned the armor and followed the clues, going to the area and exploring for... something. Moments before I was about to give up, admit that this was just wishful thinking, and that there was nothing to find, I met one of the hunters. These moments of reading into vague secrets, putting hints together and taking shots in the dark for things might not exist, culminate in exhilaration for those few times you're actually onto something. That payoff of turning over every nook and cranny is what keeps bringing me back to this world. The Old Hunters is another shot in the arm of the same serum that coursed through Bloodborne’s veins. Though diehards may pillage its secrets quickly, my approximate 15 hours spent delving its depths and gleefully employing each new destructive tool felt satisfyingly dense. The Old Hunters is an impressive return to From Software’s oppressive and rewarding universe, and while it retreads much of the same path, it’s very much a path worth taking.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	 While in the midst of my 15th boss fight in Sword Art Online: Lost Song, all I could think was: is this really all there is to it? I had fought the same type of hydra creature at least half a dozen times before, and had long since memorized a strategy for defeating it. Sword skill, sword skill, dodge, dodge, dodge, magic blast, magic blast. “Repeat as necessary” pretty much sums up the entire dull single-player campaign for Lost Song. The multiplayer does bring some much needed energy into combat, with fast-paced player vs. player rounds and a variety of co-op missions, but even that can only last for so long.  Watch 7 minutes of Sword Art Online gameplay above. Like the entertaining Sword Art Online anime, Lost Song takes place in a fictional fantasy MMO called Alfheim Online, where you can take to the skies and battle monster hordes or duel with non-playable characters. In other words, the core mechanics are all about fight and flight, both of which are done well thanks to easy and intuitive controls. It takes just a couple of quick taps on the d-pad’s up arrow to elevate into the sky (tap down twice to land), and the flight camera is dependable, though I sometimes got disorientated from having to quickly spin the camera around while fighting more agile winged enemies. Combat moves are as simple as holding down the R1 button and tapping on the face buttons or d-pad to quickly switch between sword skills and magic attacks. Combined with a block and dodge action, I quickly fell into an overly comfortable rhythm of slash, dash, blast, block, and dodge over the course of the 20-hour single-player adventure. At first it was all brainless fun.    At first it was all brainless fun: I gleefully wrecked skeletons and griffons on the battlefield and in the air. I loved owning hostile NPCs in one-on-one duels. I enjoyed gliding through the clouds and smashing strange, batlike creatures. Sometimes I was just happy to take in the view from atop a floating island. The graphics aren’t exactly cutting edge, but looking down on monsters and NPCs from above was a refreshing perspective.  There’s no real sport in standing in a corner and sniping a dragon with fireballs and ice arrows. After four or five hours, though, I got bored. Dungeons and enemies all look alike, and Alfheim Online’s seven locations aren’t big or interesting enough to explore in detail. Combat gets to be a mind-numbing affair: there’s no real sport in standing in a corner and sniping a dragon with fireballs and ice arrows. Nothing special about utterly decimating a hydra with a 16-hit sword combo. By the time I turned up the difficulty to compensate, I already knew the limited enemy types’ attack patterns, so it didn’t matter that they hit harder. And since magic and stamina are tied to meters that regenerate slowly over time, I never had to worry too much about  running out of either for very long. I just had to keep dodging and weaving enemies until my meters refilled. Even flying got to be a snooze, due to an annoying “altitude limit” placed on my heroes for the first half of the story. It was only when I completed a later quest and the ban was finally lifted that I felt a real sense of joy gliding over sunny meadows and frozen tundras, but that wasn’t enough to make the campaign worth sticking around for.  Lost Song presents Sword Art Online fans with an original story not found in the series, but it’s not that great. It retcons the awful second story arc in the Sword Art Online anime, but instead of replacing it with something exciting and meaningful it presents us with….well, nothing really. There’s a mystery involving a group known as Shamrock and their adorable leader Seven, but since there’s no real reason for Kirito and his group to get involved in their affairs, unravelling the mystery is pretty dull. On top of that, the story makes no effort to properly introduce any of the characters, so if I hadn’t already been familiar with Sword Art Online, I might have been massively confused about who these people were were and how they were all connected.  It’s pretty clear that Lost Song is aimed at hardcore SAO fans, which is why I was disappointed with the lack of fun fan-pleasing moments. Interactions between Kirito and his friends are limited to short cutscenes consisting of little more than awkward flirting. These moments might be amusing if the dialogue was cute or witty, but the humor is so flat and the dialogue so forgettable that towards the end I started jamming on the fastforward button so I could move on to something else.   Watch the Story Trailer above.  I found it easier to just stick with a small handful of team members. Your pretty teammates are much more useful in battle than they are as conversationalists, where they can use their skills and spells to help Kirito fight off baddies. Lost Song allows you to mix and match any combination of over a dozen playable characters into one three-party team, and a flexible customization feature means weapons and skills can be swapped out while in town. It temporarily injected a little life back into the combat, but with that said, I found it easier to just stick with a small handful of team members, as upgrading equipment and buying  armor can be resource intensive and pretty expensive. Lost Song’s saving grace is its well executed multiplayer. It allows you to team up with up to three other people in co-op or versus mode and is easily accessible via the town inn. I had no trouble connecting online and syncing up with other Sword Art Online fans, and I enjoyed coordinating attacks against rock monsters and harpies in co-op mode. Plus, I got a real kick out of testing my skills against other players in one-on-one duels – it puts the combat system to much better use, since humans aren’t nearly as predictable as Lost Song’s repetitive enemies. It’s dangerous to go alone into Sword Art Online: Lost Song. The single-player campaign is paper thin, combat and enemies are repetitive, and the fan service kept to a minimum. On the other hand, adding other players to the mix lets you find the fun in its smooth controls, coordinating attacks against hordes of enemies, and tough competitive duels.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	 After a year off, Need for Speed has the series coasting back over familiar turf, resurrecting the spirit of 2003 and 2004’s successful Underground games. It is, at least, a more clearly distinct game than the last few NFS instalments were from one another. It looks incredible, sounds fantastic, and while the handling is still standard arcade fare developer Ghost Games has added a welcome dose of nuance by letting us tune our cars for either grip or drift. However, the single-player component is over too soon, the multiplayer underdelivers, the cut-scene dialogue often had me wincing, and the game is stung by the side-effects of being online-only.    It is immediately extremely pretty, though. There are dark and gritty instances where it feels a little like the whole thing has been shot on Michael Mann’s iPhone, but racing at speed through the soaked streets here (particularly in bumper cam) is really something else. The cars glisten with beaded water droplets and the streets gleam, a shiny tapestry of mirror-like asphalt reflecting artificial light from all angles. Need for Speed also sounds nearly as good as it looks; the throaty burble of performance-tuned engines is well-realised and the crackle of exhaust overrun and the ker-chunk of slamming gears is similarly respectable. However, the sudden, jarring transitions from the dead of night, to pre-dawn, and then back to night again are horribly ill-conceived. These transitions seem to be baked into parts of the environment so they can actually happen multiple times over the course of a single race.  The cars glisten with beaded water droplets and the streets gleam, a shiny tapestry of mirror-like asphalt. The eclectic roster of cars is only a fraction of what’s on offer in, say, Forza Horizon 2, but it has a little something for most gearheads. Garage spots are limited to five but the focus here isn’t collecting; it’s perfecting. I completed most of Need for Speed in a single car, constantly cramming upgrades into it to keep it ahead of the competition. Performance customisation is the basic kind (bolt in everything you’re eligible to purchase and your car will go faster) but there’s a little more to visual customisation. You can sweep around your car, swap external panels, add flair to fenders, install canards, adjust stance, and more. There’s also a freeform livery editor, which definitely beats having to make do with simple, pre-set designs and wraps. You can’t modify everything, though; after I completed the story mode I splurged on a classic Ferrari F40 but was disappointed to discover I could barely do anything to it. I couldn’t even change the rims. It seems at odds with the game’s philosophy.  It’s still good to have customisation of any sort back in Need for Speed, and with it comes several basic tuning options you can use to alter your car’s driving characteristics. The main slider adjusts all settings, nudging your car towards a drift setup or a grip setup, but you can dive deeper and massage certain steering, tyre pressure, and braking power settings individually to fine tune your ride. I much preferred the drift setup for all race types because I found it far easier to get around corners by poising my Focus in a slide via a bootful of throttle and liberal use of opposite lock, rather than navigate the bends with a grip tune. The latter feels too twitchy at low speeds and too prone to understeer at higher ones, and I found myself getting frustrated trying to find the balance. Odd is the fact that, while Need for Speed has brought back tuning in a big way, the option for a manual transmission hasn’t made an appearance.   Need for Speed’s light narrative plays out in a series of short, live-action cut-scenes, brimming with slang I don’t understand, excessive energy drink consumption, overuse of the word “hashtag”, and a slightly comical amount of first-person fist-bumping. There are five main characters who, when they aren’t speaking to each other like living, breathing internet memes, each represent a different one of Need for Speed’s five themed racing threads. All of these threads lead to an encounter with a real-life automotive icon; an idea which I genuinely like.  The lack of any drag racing in Need for Speed seems like a misguided omission. The best thread is ‘Outlaw’, which is really just a mix of all the game’s race types with the cops on your tail. The cop action is scaled back from Hot Pursuit and Rivals but I certainly appreciate how the police AI seems a lot more fair and bound by the in-game physics than it ever did in Ubisoft’s The Crew. Considering it was the standout mode in the old Underground games, the lack of any drag racing in Need for Speed seems like a misguided omission. It’s not an especially long story, though. There are 79 main events, but I blasted through them in just two days. The often shameless rubber band AI screwed me out of a few wins here and there but, for the most part, there were only a handful of races I needed to repeat. This modest length might be less of a problem if the multiplayer was more robust, but it isn’t.  Like The Crew, Need for Speed requires a constant internet connection to play – even if you want to play solo. Unlike The Crew, you can’t just simply opt into multiplayer and rely on the game to take care of matchmaking and enlist you into a series of events. This really didn’t need to be an always online game, and because it is, you can’t even pause the game, which I found extraordinarily annoying. Plus, without decent PvP, the only thing left after the brief campaign is hunting down Need for Speed’s frankly boring collectables. Exactly why are we collecting photographs of plain, dimly-lit parking lots and anonymous warehouses? Need for Speed looks the part, sounds the part, and is surprisingly reverent to real-world car culture. I like the direction Ghost has taken here, and I think it’s the right one, but beneath its flashy exterior it's not quite firing on all cylinders.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	 I think of the Tales series as RPG comfort food. It reliably delivers cheerful characters, a story anchored in friendship, and a unique brawler-tinged spin on RPG combat. Tales of Zestiria is no exception, but the big shift to an open world and some flashy new combat moves makes it pleasantly different from its predecessors.  The first and most welcome change is its open world. Zestiria removes the pen that once confined us to narrow corridors of trees and bushes and lets you freely journey through a nice variety of locations that include green pastures, sand-swept deserts, and gloomy swamps. This gives Zestiria’s world a sense of immersion that some of its more linear predecessors lack. Treasure chests and stat-boosting herbs found throughout a typical Tales world are still there, but I like that Zestiria also includes Normin: cute little critters tucked away in  hidden corners that grant special skills to equipment. There are also Lords of the Land, helpful deities that let you do things like fast-travel and replenish treasure chests if you establish a good enough rapport with them. These are all nice rewards for putting on your wide-brimmed fedora and venturing through the landscape. Zestiria’s world has a sense of immersion that some of its more linear predecessors lack.    The one hiccup in the world design is the linear dungeons. They’re short and contrived, with right-angled corridors and bland, monochromatic walls. Puzzles are used as cheap padding to make some dungeons appear longer or more complex than they really are. The prize for worst puzzle goes to the Water Temple, where eyes in the walls teleport you all the way back to the entrance if they see you. Though some of these puzzles include the clever use of map actions like burning spiderwebs with fire magic or using wind to teleport across gaps in the floor, most just feel like a chore.  Luckily, dungeons feature fantastic music, which helps alleviate some of the tedium. The Wind Temple theme is particularly impressive with its soaring strings and heavy drumbeats. There’s also a nice variety of enemies: killer starfish and aggressive elephants require different strategies to defeat, which prevents battle fatigue from setting in.   Like the world map, the series’ traditional Linear Motion Battle System combat has had some new life breathed into it. Characters still dole out pain on an enclosed field by using physical and magical actions known as Artes (which can be chained together in brawler-type combos), but the new Armitization feature ratchets up the fun by allowing protagonist Sorey and his human companions to fuse with their seraphic friends and become powerful entities on the battlefield.  The Armitized character designs are wonderfully over-the-top (think capital “A” anime), and it’s amusing to watch my heroes unleash spells like Ocean Blitz -- a pinwheel torrent of water resembling a hose turned on full blast --on enemies. This doesn’t mean that going super Saiyan on enemies is always the right approach. Zestiria does a nice job balancing the scales of combat by binding Artes to a series of gauges that, when depleted, must be refilled before you can use your skills again. Artes are also tied to a clever rock-paper-scissor mechanic that encourages you to adjust your battle plan according to an enemy’s particular strengths and weaknesses; no mindless spamming allowed. Getting ready for combat is almost as enjoyable as combat itself.  Getting ready for combat is almost as enjoyable as combat itself. Zestiria’s customization is fairly deep, which makes dressing for battle fun. Each piece of equipment has four skill slots, three of which can be filled however you see fit, and items of the same type can be fused together to create powerful pieces that sport new and better skills that can be used in battle. I enjoyed mixing and matching my inventory and getting varying results, a process made easier by a skill sheet that shows you different ways to stack or arrange your skills for maximum benefit.   I wish I could be as enthusiastic about the story, but alas, I found it to be pretty weak. Despite an intriguingly cynical view on the human condition (some people are evil because of the strength of their convictions, not because they’re possessed by demons), the story never truly deviates from the typical trope of “young country boy is tasked with purging the world of malevolence.” The cast of characters also lacks a certain spark. Aside from the ever-earnest Alisha and the spunky, effervescent Rose, Zestiria’s heroes are fairly forgettable. It doesn’t help that the pace of the last act is dragged down by a lot of unnecessary backtracking. Zesitia’s handy teleportation system is constantly disabled to force you to hoof it from one end of a giant map to the other. It’s a royal pain, made worse when it’s all just to watch a 10-second cutscene that could have been triggered in a more efficient and enjoyable manner. Having to traverse giant maps on foot is rough, but the good news is time flies a bit faster when playing with friends. Like in previous Tales, Zestiria features a local only four-player multiplayer option, something I think more RPGs should have. I had a good time coordinating attacks with my friends, even though the zoomed-out camera sometimes made it hard to see and character movements looked choppier than when playing alone. Tales of Zestiria doesn’t deviate too far from its competent predecessors, but it’s not a carbon copy, either. It may have linear dungeons and a less-than-stellar story, but it’s open-world exploration, enjoyable customization, and flashy new Armitization feature are enough for it to stand on its own.
Tom Mc Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	 Imagine being in a fight where the other person doesn't throw a punch. On the one hand, you would feel like a bully. No one who fancies themselves a hero would beat up someone who refuses to fight back, but there might be a small part of your brain that would enjoy exerting such uninhibited strength. Dragon Quest Heroes: The World Tree's Woe and the Blight Below stands at that crossroads. As I cut down unceasing swarms of cute, pacifistic enemies, I wondered who's the real villain in this exercise. Of course, none of that mattered once I began to enjoy the spectacle.   So-called heroes grab their swords and axes to tear down the creatures they once loved without mercy. One day, cuddly monsters that the inhabitants of this fantasy land had formed a happy peace with are tainted by a dark wizard and turn on their companions. Personally, I can't imagine raising my fist against my dog no matter how vicious he became, but the people in Dragon Quest Heroes have no such restraint: the so-called heroes grab their swords and axes to tear down the creatures they once loved without mercy or the remorse you’d hope for in someone forced to kill. It’s even worse that the monsters are so hopelessly outmatched in this contest, and even the adorable slimes stand no chance against the angry mob made of you and your friends.   That dark premise is antithetical to the unbridled cheeriness that populates this world. Characters come bearing odd ticks that border on comical, and the farcical tone fits in wonderfully with the cheery visual design. King Doric is a boastful man who would rather fight than govern, Kiryl constantly lectures Alena using outdated vernacular, and Luceus designs elaborate battle plans that are ignored by Aurora, who sports a devil-may-care attitude. All of these traits are funny, at least initially. After the dozenth identical joke, though, the charm fades, and you're stuck with a predictable light-versus-dark story that fails to engender much excitement.  The action is just as straightforward as the story. A sea of enemies - skeletons, for instance - marches toward your four-person party. Watch for a moment and you see how they walk in unison, their arms and legs swaying with exact synchronicity that recalls an adept puppeteer. Stand still for a little while longer and you are lost in the crowd as they continue ahead, and only a few will raise a boney fist against you. Yet, should something compel you to act out against these non-aggressors, you can swing your sword wildly at your former friends, performing elaborate combos as they fall helplessly at your feet. Within seconds, you can decimate their fragile bodies, ready to take on whoever else dares to stand benignly in your path.  I could excel without thought, flexing my genocidal might without pushing my fingers to their breaking point. Despite the ease with which the myriad foes topple, the escapades still deliver pleasure without making me struggle to achieve it. Tapping just two buttons to cause untold pain to hundreds was satisfying in ways that are far different than, say, the methodical fights present in Dark Souls. Here, I could excel without thought, flexing my genocidal might without pushing my fingers to their breaking point. The rhythm of combat is hypnotic because there's nothing to interrupt the action. It's straight ahead sword swinging without stakes, and the hours flew by as I guided my heroes from one victory to another.  The majority of the 30 hours I spent in Dragon Quest Heroes’ campaign is composed of these battles that lack strategic demands. It’s only after you dive deeper into your quest that the monsters grow backbones. Minions still populate the battlefield with something other than fighting on their minds, but they are accompanied by large beasts  – a giant slime, towering golem, eight-legged grotesquery, and other meanies – who have had it up to here with your bullying. They can lay waste to your team without breaking a sweat, finally giving you a reason to unleash the more complex tactics that served as overkill against the passive prey.   Tension is the most important of these tools. Landing hits slowly builds a meter that, when full, gives you momentary invincibility and a powerful attack. Because each character has their own tension meter, you can chain a few mighty strikes together to bring a boss to its knees. Filling this meter finally gives a purpose to those mindless grunts. Beating them up is an easy way to gain tension, so there’s a reason for your slaying beyond the spectacle of conquest. There are also portals that endlessly spew out enemies until you exterminate the gatekeeper. Called mawkeepers, these baddies fall between bosses and grunts on the difficulty scale, forcing you to put a little more thought in your actions.  When all of these elements converge, the action becomes a chaotic explosion. It's those tougher battles that bring a cerebral bent to the mindless killings. No longer can you just blindly mash buttons until the victory music plays. Rather, you must roam across the arena to close portals and slay enemies. There's usually a precious object that must be protected (or else you fail the mission), and so you repeatedly circle back to ensure no one is taking potshots at it. By killing enemies you earn monster cards that let you plant sentries to guard your backside. When all of these elements converge, the action becomes a chaotic explosion in which you feverishly sprint from one objective to the next while trying to read the cluttered map. Other heroes join you in your quest as you venture forth, and these, too, force you to make strategic choices. When you form your four-person team, you need to make sure everyone can contribute. Do you want an archer to provide long-distance attacks? A brute to swing his axe recklessly? A mage to fill the battlefield with colorful bubbles? These are important choices that make it seem like a misstep could spell failure, though I found that success came no matter who I teamed up with. There are also weapons to buy, items to craft, and baubles to build, but running from shop to shop between missions is, unfortunately, as shallow as the fighting. There aren't many choices and it's pretty obvious which of the three whips, for instance, is best. Dragon Quest Heroes occupies a similar place as games like Hyrule Warriors and Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor. The combat that makes up the majority of gameplay is fun but forgettable, and there's little else to keep you engaged unless you're sufficiently attached to the license. In that regard, Dragon Quest Heroes looks delightful and is bursting with characters and creatures from the history of the franchise, so anyone who has been glued to each new release since the heyday of Enix will find enough familiar sights to stay invested. However, if you're still puzzling over the differences between Dragon Quest and Dragon Warrior, there are much better fights to seek out.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	 Disgaea is like an old oak: its sturdy trunk and roots persist even as its leaves change color, fall off, and sprout anew. Disgaea 5: Alliance of Vengeance doesn’t take any risks with the series’ bread and butter turn-based tactical combat - I’m still having a blast tossing explosive penguins and grinding late into the night to create the most perfectly customized cast of demonic misfits I can manage. It’s those new metaphorical leaves that give each new Disgaea its unique flavor though, and Disgaea 5’s many new branches succeed in keeping the formula fresh, even if they don’t all improve on the systems they’re replacing.  If you haven’t played a Disgaea game in a while, don’t worry: it’s still the addictive time sink of an RPG it’s always been. As ever, you can tweak your many party members and their gear in an overwhelming number of ways, and pretty much all those ways involve a time and/or resource investment. Just when I’d thought I was happy with where a given character was, I’d decide to re-roll them in order to boost their leveling progress (called reincarnating), level some new gear, and slap some new passive abilities on them to squeeze out just a few extra drops of power. This what I’ve always loved most about Disgaea - there’s practically no limit to what you can do if you have the patience and conceptual understanding to do it. It’s still the addictive time sink of an RPG it’s always been.  Disgaea 5 expands these possibilities even further with some new monster types and character classes, not the least of which is the Maid, a class dedicated to making efficient use of consumable items. In the past, having a character spend their one action per turn on a healing or attack item felt like a waste given the other options at their disposal. The Maid smartly solves this with a passive traits that allows her to use an item in addition to her standard action, and she can eventually earn other traits that greatly increase the range and effectiveness of items as well. This effectively transforms what used to be an uninteresting resource into something that can be the difference between life and death.   New classes aside, Disgaea 5 supplements its familiar core with even more extra layers than just about any entry in the series, though not all of it necessarily succeeds. Some of the winners include a map editor that allows you to create and share your own custom maps, the ability to assign your characters a subclass, and the new Squad system, which allows you to group party members together in order to gain unique bonuses and abilities.  For example, characters thrown into the Giant Killer Squad will be giant-sized for their first three turns in battle, and members of the Foot Soldier Squad get stat bonuses based on how many people have been enlisted to their ranks. Though that’s a lot to manage, it provides a welcome incentive to hire and level as many characters as you can to to take full advantage of what squads have to offer. There’s practically no limit to what you can do if you have the patience and conceptual understanding to do it.  Even the less successful ones, like the new Interrogation or Quest systems add some new flavor, despite feeling slightly extraneous and fiddly to manage. Accepting quests gives you near-term goals to shoot for in order to unlock new classes or earn rare items, but there’s no way to check on them unless you go back to the quest NPC in the hub world. Interrogation bends captured enemy units to your will, but the actual benefits seem a bit light given the trouble of capturing them versus killing them. Disgaea’s structure is such that you don’t need to make use of every system and mechanic available to you in order to succeed, so it never feels like an obstacle to progress.   It’s okay that Disgaea 5 doesn’t take any huge risks with its tried-and-true formula, but I do wish the series would hold on to ideas that work and iterate on them rather than always toss them for something new. For instance, Disgaea D2’s monster mount system added an excellent new layer to the relationship between human and monster units, but it’s been scrapped for the older Magichange system, which while novel, doesn’t provide the same functionality and feels like a step sideways. Magichange isn’t bad or anything, but it’s effects are temporary, and require you to redeploy the monster unit afterwards, making it less flexible.  This is the first Disgaea for the PlayStation 4 and though it doesn’t take huge advantage of the added power, Disgaea 5 is the sharpest, cleanest looking one yet. All the jagged edges on the sprite characters are gone, and the special effects on big spells and attacks run hitch-free. Beyond the technical improvements though, Disgaea 5’s use of color is worth commending. This series has always been a colorful affair, but there’s a really great balance of warm and cool colors, and some nice gradients between the two here. It’s subtle, but it helps Disgaea 5 look markedly better than its most recent predecessor. Few franchises can get away with feeling this similar from version to version, but Disgaea is just that deep, requiring you to understand and exploit character stats, equipment attributes, and class abilities at a level most modern RPGs have abandoned in the name of accessibility. Disgaea 5’s many new and tweaked gameplay features hit way more often than they miss, and together with its distinctive brand of campy fun and some subtle but welcome visual improvements, they make this one of the better Disgaeas.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	 Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 occasionally flirts with the joy of movement and attitude that made the original four games classics, but the wheels quickly come off. There are a disappointing number of design and technical problems that range from frustrating to flat-out broken, making this attempt at returning the series to glory a non-starter.   Developer Robomodo started with a good idea: paring Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater back down to the basics of the series. You won't be hopping off your board, exploring open worlds, or standing on a weird piece of plastic. Instead, Pro Skater 5 leaves you to test your ability to chain together tricks, manuals, and grinds, much like classic Hawk. It almost works. At times, I found myself getting back into that familiar rhythm that made me fall in love with the original games. I had moments of zen that balanced the combination of learning the maps, memorizing your move set, and the risk-reward of when to pull out of a chain.    Frustrating moments pulled me out of my groove far too often.  But any of that nostalgia was quickly erased by Pro Skater 5's frustrating interface, bland levels, and jagged edges. For example, the one major addition to your arsenal is a physically impossible slam move that sends your skater rocketing down to the ground at the press of a button. The problem here is that slam is mapped to the same button as grind, and it can’t be changed. I can’t count the number of times I intended on continuing a combo with a grind, only to accidentally slam down to the ground and end the chain. Frustrating moments pulled me out of my groove far too often.   But the most glaring thing that consistently thwarted my attempts to enjoy Pro Skater 5 were the rampant performance issues. It’s appallingly rife with glitches, hiccups, and collision disasters, which are particularly noticeable in a game that’s primarily about how the human body interacts with the world when traveling at high speeds. Far too often, I witnessed my character pass through geometry instead of slamming into it, fly straight up into the air as though he’d stepped on a spring trap, or fall on the ground for no apparent reason.    I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of bands I even recognized, let alone liked.  Also, though Tony Hawk 5 is ostensibly an online game, I don't recommend playing it that way (or at all, really). The addition of a dozen other players skating around your map slows the framerate down, adds to load times, and doesn't really introduce any interesting social elements. I found myself playing offline in order to have a smoother experience. But “smoother” is a relative term, because even then, menus don't convey enough information and load screens pop up far too often, killing momentum in what should be a fast-paced game. Classic Tony Hawk attitude is the other big thing I miss in Pro Skater 5. Starting at the soundtrack, a seminal part of previous games, this one’s music doesn’t pay homage to the west coast hip-hop and punk scene from the past four decades in the same way that the originals did. I consider myself pretty well-versed in music, and yet I was hard-pressed to find more than a handful of bands I even recognized, let alone liked.   Apart from the music, the levels generally lack any sort of charm or identity. Many are a hodgepodge of elements from classic maps like The Warehouse, but none of them really stand on their own as memorable. Even worse is that many of the trick lines aren’t conveyed in a effective manner. There aren't enough visual cues throughout the levels to give you confidence in your next move, and I found my character obscuring my view far too often, making it impossible to see what was coming up next.  ...the levels generally lack any sort of charm or identity.  Inside each stage there are a dozen or so challenges pulled from a pretty boring pool of tasks, like destroying 10 thingies or grinding for an eternity. You choose these from a list, but it's annoying that you don't know what the challenge is before you load into it, especially given the fact that there's no way to easily quit one and go back to the level if you decide you don’t want to do it. You either have to wait for the timer to run down, or pop all the back out to the main menu. This makes hopping between challenges a legitimate chore.   Aside from unlocking more levels, completing these challenges adds to the ways you can customize your characters. I liked the aesthetic options, especially nods to other games like Octodad and Ratchet and Clank. Unlocking a new head or costume is a great little moment -- and there’s something appropriate about skating around dressed as Octodad, whose humor is based on being a clumsy character whose limbs defy the laws of physics, in a game as prone to glitchy chaos as this one. On the flip side, earning stat points and upgrading my rider’s abilities seemed completely pointless. I honestly couldn’t tell the difference between controlling a vanilla character without any stat boosts, and a fully upgraded one. The earlier Pro Skater games had a really great sense of progression throughout the campaigns, and that sensation is completely absent in Pro Skater 5. Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 5’s rare moments of nostalgic joy are drowned out by its abundance of poorly thought out levels, control problems, bugs, and its glaring lack of attitude. It boggles the mind that a $60 game in 2015 can be riddled with so many technical issues.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	" The Uncharted series is one of the best action adventure franchises in recent gaming history, and Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection is the best way to play them today. These are lovingly handled remasters that bring out and preserve the beautiful art direction of the originals, and the upgrade to 60 frames per second lends even greater fluidity to all three Uncharted games’ already excellent gameplay. I only wish The Nathan Drake Collection presented itself more like a celebration of Naughty Dog’s great series rather than a simple bundle of three admittedly brilliant games.    Uncharted: Drake's Fortune is now eight years old (read our original Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune review), but you'd be hard-pressed to notice here. Though it certainly can't pass as a native PS4 game, remaster developer Bluepoint has upgraded just enough so that Drake's first outing still has those visual ""wow"" moments, and the doubled frame rate alleviates the original PlayStation 3 version’s slightly sluggish aiming substantially. Drake's Fortune balances gunplay, platforming, and exploration with rare grace.  Otherwise, there are no gameplay enhancements to speak of, besides the welcome lack of Sixaxis control elements. Despite the fact that its successors improved upon it in every imaginable way, Drake’s Fortune still feels like magic to play. Its play spaces feel ever so slightly constricted compared to the broader, more vertical designs of the later games, and I noticed a clunky character animation or two, but even by today's standards, it balances gunplay, platforming, and exploration with rare grace.    Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is on a whole other level however. (Read our original Uncharted 2: Among Thieves review.) Even compared to many PlayStation 4 games, the urban ruins of Uncharted 2's Nepal are absolutely double-take worthy. There’s an unbelievable amount of detail among the dilapidated buildings and rusted hulks of cars that have long since stopped running, and this remaster really helps it all sing. Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is on a whole other level.  It's worth noting that though Bluepoint reportedly evened out the aiming mechanics for all three games, Among Thieves still feels half a step snappier than its predecessor, making its gunplay more immediate and enjoyable. Perfect pacing, excellent character banter, and incredible set pieces like the insane Nepal helicopter sequence make this the best game in the series.    Finally, we have Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception (read our original Uncharted 3: Drake’s Deception review), a bigger, more narratively ambitious game than either of the previous two. It effectively delves deeper into Nate’s past, and his personal relationships, which are just as much a part of Uncharted’s success as its gameplay. Right from the start, its cinematography frames Uncharted 3 like a big budget Hollywood film, and the increased visual fidelity and improved textures and character models really help complete the cinematic feel that Drake’s Deception got so right the first time around. Sony’s flagship series deserves a bit more reverence than this package affords.  It might sound odd to complain that three beautiful versions of three excellent games is “all” you get in this package, but you’ll get little else from The Nathan Drake Collection. The new “Speed Run” mode is nothing but a timer in the corner, and along with the omission of the multiplayer modes from Uncharted 2 and 3 (which I honestly do not miss), there’s a surprising lack of supplemental materials. You won’t find any nice character bios, or concept art of the series’ many stunning locales here, which seems like a missed opportunity given how well Uncharted’s universe lends itself to such content (and seeing the treatment Rare Replay got earlier this year). Though not a huge deal, I think Sony’s flagship series deserves a bit more reverence than this package affords.  Missing bells and whistles aside, these three exemplary games have never looked or played better than they do here, so whether you’ve played them before or not, Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection should be in your library.  These games have aged remarkably well, they’re still an absolute blast to play, and their characters are as charming and memorable as ever."
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	 Defense wins championships, and the improvements to AI defenses in NBA 2K16 bring this year’s iteration of the long-running basketball sim another title. Due to some big AI upgrades, the offensive tactics that I had been accustomed to using simply no longer work, so I was forced to think like a coach and constantly adapt. Running pick and rolls and calling plays finally felt like it was necessary, as opposed to a tougher option I had to enforce on myself. NBA 2K16 is a great representation of the sport of basketball, and it plays like a dream – both online and off.   Player models are upgraded with new, more detailed body scans, and that has a profound effect on the overall experience. Not that it was suffering visually before, but NBA 2K16 looks better than ever. The player models are upgraded with new, more detailed body scans, and that has a profound effect on the overall experience. Faces, hair styles, body types, and even wingspans are true to life, but the wide variety of new signature animations bring it all together. In fact, the presentation in general has received a lot of love this year, and brand new game-opening sequences, from team introductions to the national anthem, did a good job of distracting me from the lengthy load times. In the studio, Kenny Smith joins Ernie Johnson and Shaq in entertaining, chemistry-led, semi-contextual pregame, halftime, and postgame shows, and Greg Anthony replaces Steve Kerr as the color commentator. The interactions between the commentators is fun, and there are far fewer misplaced reactions than in previous years – although it does still happen from time to time. Player interviews have returned as well, but disappointingly some have been reused from previous years. The addition of stunning new in-studio interviews more than makes up for it, in the grand scheme of things.   The big reason to show up this year, though, is that NBA 2K’s gameplay has been completely upgraded in nearly every way, resulting in a more true-to-life simulation experience. In previous years, I always found it easy to score by cheezing my way past AI defenders, running in circles and forcing them to make unrealistic mistakes. All of that is gone this year. Zig-zagging will result in steals and frustration, and attempts to drive the baseline will end up in terrible or blocked shots. The only reliable way to score is to use real basketball concepts, so if you’re a student of the sport you'll find yourself being rewarded for your knowledge. You have to improvise, because opposing AI coaches will start to learn your tendencies and try new ways to stop you. For example, defenders had been going underneath screens, allowing me to step back and take open jumpers; after a few successful attempts they started going around screens, forcing me to drive the lane instead. This constant game of cat and mouse kept me on my toes, searching for new ways to make plays. Additionally, the controls have been adjusted and streamlined, adding dedicated buttons for lobs and bounce passes. The most meaningful change, however, is to the post game, which is now initiated with L2 (or LT). Backing a defender down feels much more responsive, since you no longer have to wait for animations to settle before making your next move. But I learned quickly that even perfectly timed shots won’t always go in, which is much more realistic than before.    You can relocate and completely rebrand your team with a mind-boggling amount of options. There are a staggering amount of ways you can play NBA 2K16. All the game modes I expect of the series make their triumphant return, some with interesting new wrinkles. The new Play Now Online mode makes head-to-head matches matter a bit more, since it features a promotion and relegation system. MyGM and MyLeague modes are now both fully featured management sims, allowing you to go so far as to relocate and completely rebrand your team with a mind-boggling amount of options. That same team editor can also be used in MyTeam, the card-collecting game, which has new challenges and ways to earn virtual currency. But the most notable and popular game mode is MyCareer, which has been taken in a completely different and unfortunately static direction. Spike Lee wrote and directed this mode as a documentary-style movie entitled Livin’ Da Dream. Once you create your character (whose unchangeable nickname is Frequency Vibrations, by the way) you’re dropped into the life of a high school phenom from Harlem with dreams of the NBA. Those early high school games are a bit dull, without commentary or any real challenge, since my player was a 6’7” point guard and the tallest guy on the court. But being recruited by officially licensed colleges and universities is extremely well done.   Even if a heated conversation was all about a choice I needed to make, I was never allowed to make it myself. The story itself is mediocre and the dialogue is a little corny, despite being well acted. Some interesting moments were emotionally charged and kept my attention, but its movie-style plot made it a poor fit for a game that’s supposed to be about our players. The catch phrase for the mode is “Be the Story,” but even if a heated conversation was all about a choice I needed to make, I was never allowed to make it myself. The most jarring example happened when my friends and family were all giving me advice about whether I should stay in college: Each character ultimately told me that “only you can make the choice.” But then a second later, the NBA draft started. Apparently my mind was made up for me. Even looking past the lack of choices, the story became disjointed during my rookie season. The cutscenes led me to believe that I was a special player, but my overall rating was 55, since I was unable to earn any virtual currency up until that point. The AI improvements carry over to MyCareer, which made it extremely difficult to make any positive plays with a weak player. As a result, on the court I felt like I kept letting my team down... but off the court, I was signing shoe deals. Another flaw that can’t be overlooked is that your family, including your twin sister, is black, even if your created character is not.   Livin’ Da Dream reaches its conclusion after your rookie season, which only has eight playable games. After that, it opens up and plays more like the mode I was expecting, with 82-game seasons and new and exciting ways to improve your player on off days. That’s why I can enthusiastically recommend NBA 2K16 even with MyCareer’s failure to properly contextualize my player’s rise to stardom: at the end of the day, it’s all window dressing for the gameplay underneath – and in this case, that gameplay is spectacular.   For the first time in several years, I’ve only experienced a few online hiccups. It’s important to note that NBA 2K16 continues to heavily rely on its online servers, since microtransactions are present in most of the game modes. But for the first time in several years, I’ve only experienced a few hiccups since they’ve been turned on. The 2K Sports Store, where you spend VC on vanity items, has been hit or miss, and the ProAm mode, a 5v5 MyPark with NBA rules, has been completely inaccessible. But the online experience is generally pretty consistent in every other connected mode, with no significant interruptions to my online play. What a relief. NBA 2K16 is one of the most complete packages I’ve ever seen. Developer Visual Concepts continues to raise the sports simulation bar by completely retooling its silky-smooth gameplay, adding brand-new physics systems, and refining its traditional game modes. Not all of the changes work as well as others, most notably the Spike Lee-themed MyCareer mode, but it doesn’t take away from the impressive overall package.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	 There came a moment when Marty McFly, Chell from Portal, and The Wicked Witch of the West were all fighting a giant robotic Joker atop a building in Springfield when I stopped and wondered just what the heck was going on. But then again, I was having a complete blast watching it all happen. LEGO Dimensions is developer Traveler’s Tales first foray into the toys-to-life genre, which is a natural fit for its virtual versions of physical LEGO. While the gameplay itself is still relatively simplistic, the personality that runs through each and every world is the reason to stick around.   This is the kitchen sink approach: throughout the 10-hour campaign, you’ll bounce from the settings of classic movies like Back to the Future and beloved comics like Batman to amazing games like Portal. Like in the charming LEGO Movie, these collisions are fun, creative, and rife with hilarious, idiosyncratic interactions. Small moments, like how Homer Simpson is so very confused at the fact that Scooby-Doo is a talking dog, are Dimensions’ greatest strength. With the starter pack, you’ll get to play through the entire campaign with Batman, Gandalf, and Wyldstyle from The LEGO Movie. While there’s a satisfying amount of game there, you’ll need to opt in and buy the additional sets in order to unlock some of the best open-world side areas. Wandering around a fully realized Springfield complete with dozens of hilarious nods to the show, or going through Aperture Science with the original voice actors and some really great, actually Valve-esque puzzles is a treat, but not mandatory.   The love and care given to packing those worlds with cute, clever nods -- falling off the map in Oz drops you down into a sepia-colored version of tornado-wrecked Kansas -- made exploring those spaces a joy. It’s even better when Dimensions mashes two universes together, like when Sauron from Lord of the Rings goes on a tear through Superman’s Metropolis, or when serious LEGO Batman meets the idiot Batman from The LEGO movie. Traveler’s Tales’ fantastic brand of Pixar-esque humor can make a kid laugh while simultaneously layering on more nuanced jokes aimed at adults, and it had me smiling throughout most of my time with Dimensions. A particularly great moment was when Batman travels to Oz and is convinced that the Scarecrow from the classic movie is the same Scarecrow that has terrorized Gotham City.   The problem with Dimensions leaning so heavily on in-jokes from its breadth of inspirations is that if you’re not as familiar with a specific movie, show, or game, entire sections fall flat. For example, when I spent a half hour fighting through a series of Ninjago bosses, I couldn’t appreciate the humor and instead had nothing to prevent me from noticing how simplistic the combat and puzzle-solving in Dimensions really is. A solid chunk of the enjoyment directly correlates with your love of a specific movie or game and your ability to understand and appreciate deep-cut references. What you’re actually doing moment-to-moment will feel incredibly familiar to anybody who’s played any of the past dozen or so LEGO games – which isn’t bad, but has worn a bit thin over the years. You destroy everything in sight, build a whole bunch of crazy structures, and collect millions of bolts that act as currency.   The big change with Dimensions, though, is the physicality introduced through the toys and the portal that you connect to your console. Any LEGO Dimensions character or object you place on one of the portal’s seven positions is transported into the game world. Note: It’s actually just the disc on the bottom that matters (which is a little scary because of how easy it’d be for a kid to lose it). The characters are just regular LEGO dudes. Dimensions quickly begins throwing simple but tedious puzzles at you that require physically manipulating the toys on the portal. Bosses will trap your character in an energy field, forcing you to move that piece to another square on the board. Likewise, certain puzzles require you to place specific characters on specific spots in order to imbue them with elemental powers necessary to put out fires or charge batteries in the environment.   While I really appreciate this idea in theory, it oftentimes didn’t work for me in execution. Puzzles didn’t challenge me mentally, but rather just became physical exercises in moving a toy onto a new spot of a specific color. They were never quite deep enough to deliver that “aha!” moment you get from thinking about a problem in a new way, and instead, just acted as a barrier between me and the next piece of much-appreciated humor or creativity. LEGO Dimensions’ kitchen-sink approach to packing its worlds full of great characters and fun references consistently left me with a big dumb grin on my face. While the puzzles that required physically moving the pieces became tedious, the act of exploring dozens of locations based on things I’ve adored since my childhood was genuinely entertaining. The collision of worlds is smart, the references are handled with care, and the story is genuinely smart.
Chris Schilling	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	 PES 2016 might well be the best football game ever made. To explain why is something of a challenge. The improvements don't lend themselves easily to snappy back-of-the-box soundbites. I can’t point to a single change or addition that makes all the difference. Rather, it’s a game that has been refined in dozens of small ways, all of which have a cumulatively positive effect. This year, PES has shaken off the last remnants of PS2-era rigidity, delivering a faster, more responsive and more fluid game of football. I’m always a little reluctant to make direct comparisons to FIFA – not least as I’ve only played the demo version of EA Sports’ game – because the two handle in such distinctly different ways. For my money, while FIFA more accurately recreates the look of the sport, PES is the game that most closely captures the feel.   For starters, there’s a much stronger sense of physicality this year. It’s most obvious when players jostle for possession (and, indeed, for position). Before, it often felt like outcomes were binary, but it’s no longer quite so predictable. Context is everything: whether you win or lose the ball in a challenge is dependent on a number of factors, taking into consideration the skill of the players involved and their position in relation to the ball and one another. A clean slide tackle is particularly satisfying: contingent on player momentum, they’re among the most tangible demonstrations of your ability to read the game and your opponent. Referees are thankfully more lenient than in real life: you can barrel into a challenge at speed, cleaning out the player as well as winning the ball, but as long as you make contact, it won’t automatically draw a foul. By the same token, if you repeatedly jab X while running alongside an opponent to attempt a standing tackle, rather than waiting for the right moment to step in, then you’re bound to concede a free-kick. The attacking game has been tweaked, too, and it’s here you’ll first notice the effort Konami has invested in individualising players. Anyone with a low centre of gravity – like Alexis Sanchez, Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero – is a joy to control, as these players have the balance to skip over challenges, occasionally stumbling when clipped but always striving to stay on their feet.   There’s a clear difference between these players and someone like Raheem Sterling, who has whippet-like pace, but his slight build means he’s outmuscled much more easily. You might win the odd free-kick with a bit of trickery, but if you’re planning to use his pace, you’re better off playing the ball in behind for him to sprint onto – aim through balls too close to defenders and he’ll be bundled off it all too easily. Shooting is similarly contextual, and the type of strike noticeably varies from player to player. Tevez in particular has a Howitzer of a right foot, and while you’d ordinarily expect the ball to rise the longer you press the shot button, it’s a joy to see him thundering a low-bouncing strike below the dive of the goalkeeper, fizzing off the surface to send the net billowing. Talking of ‘keepers, they’re more alert and reactive this time around, scrambling across their goal to palm away daisy-cutters, and getting up quickly to lunge at loose balls they’ve just parried. The idea of player personality goes well beyond the game’s biggest stars. As a Manchester City fan, I naturally gravitated towards them for my first few matches; I expected to find Yaya Toure would be hard to stop when galloping at defenders, and that a typical David Silva through-ball would be a thing of measured perfection. But I was thrilled to see the tenacity of Pablo Zabaleta equally well represented, while Aleksandar Kolarov’s marauding runs down the left would invariably result in a cross whipped in with a palpable increase in pace from the norm. It works both ways, of course: Vincent Kompany might be imperious in the air, but his tendency to step up and try to win the ball early can be exploited by clever tactics. One opponent was able to use this to his advantage, regularly finding gaps down the channels until I made a change to tighten things up. Like last year’s game, some players are clearly overpowered, but then that’s true to life: Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi are close to unplayable, but it’s up to you to find a way to deal with them, whether it’s doubling-up on markers, cutting off their supply lines – or even tactical fouling. The upshot of this is that game management is more crucial than ever. Substitutions and changes of formation can make all the difference in a tightly fought contest. Introducing a tricky winger for the last 15 minutes against a tired defence, for example, can create havoc. On one such occasion I brought Franck Ribery off the bench in a bid to torment a flagging Borussia Dortmund rearguard: in the minutes that followed, a red card and an own goal turned what had been a tight game into a rout.   The movement of your team-mates, meanwhile, is sensational – to a fault. If you’ve got a full-back that likes to get forward, you’ll often see them streaking down the touchline ahead of your wingers, gesturing ostentatiously to receive the ball. Give the ball away in this situation and you can end up horribly exposed. You can curb their natural instincts by tinkering with tactics, though it’s not always wise to ignore a player’s strengths when you can adjust the system instead. There’s never any need to remember elaborate button combinations to accomplish your goals. PES subtly simplifies everything, without ever leaving you feeling like you’re not fully in control. Sometimes you might use flicks and step-overs to bamboozle an opponent; sometimes you might only need a sudden change of pace to open up space. There’s a small degree of automation involved, but it’s perfectly calibrated: you might not be directly responsible for the tiny hop that allows you to clear a last-ditch challenge, but you’ll feel it was your own mastery that enabled you to get there in the first place. A step closer to the defender, after all, and they’d surely have robbed you. Away from the pitch, menus are much more user-friendly, with the ability to pin your favourite game types to the home screen, while Master League has undergone an interface overhaul that makes one of the medium’s best career modes even more enjoyable. I’m not about to list all the licences that are present and those that aren’t, as you can easily find that information elsewhere; besides, it’s clear that while Konami is still trying to grab as many as it can, this is one area where FIFA will always have the upper hand. That said, this year PS4 owners will be able to use option files: assuming the PES community doesn’t suffer a sudden attack of lazyitis, then you should soon be able to import accurate rosters, kits, team names and more. If Konami has found the right kind of chemistry on the pitch, it’s still searching when it comes to the commentary box. The ebullient Peter Drury is a welcome replacement for Jon Champion, but he’s a little too unrestrained, greeting deflected consolation goals and injury-time scissor kick winners alike with the same rhapsodic, full-throated delight. The contrast with the terminally unimpressed Jim Beglin is especially stark.  With retail servers now online, I’ve been able to test how PES 2016’s netcode holds up, and so far it’s looking very promising. I’ve encountered a few instances of mild lag during games, but oddly it always seems to occur at non-crucial moments – the biggest delay I saw came when my opponent hoofed a clearance downfield. It might take a while for some to acclimatise to online play, since you’re rarely afforded the same time and space on the ball, but the boost in pace and responsiveness makes for some really exciting and closely competitive online matches. Don’t expect many cagey 0-0s: I’ve already won *and* lost a game by the odd goal in seven. MyClub mode, meanwhile, has benefitted from a number of tweaks that make it more involving than before. Player levelling offers a more tangible sense of individual progress, while supporting squad members can still fulfil a useful role as a trainer. Players will gain additional experience by linking up with these coaches: should they form an affinity, you’ll get an XP boost. If in its debut season MyClub seemed like a slightly tentative attempt to appeal to the FUT crowd, it’s taken a clear and confident step forward to become a worthwhile alternative. It’s hard to pick fault with what Konami has achieved. I think it’s still too early to say with absolute confidence that PES 2016 is the best football game ever. Historically, it’s in the weeks and months after release that a football game can really establish its place in the hearts and minds of its community. Only then can its idiosyncrasies be truly tested, and its nuances fully understood. Only then will sweet spots and exploits make themselves known. What I can say right now is this: hand on heart, I can’t remember ever being so consistently thrilled, surprised and delighted by a football game before. After the rebuilding comes the refinement – though that doesn’t do justice to the myriad improvements that help transform a great football game into an all-time great. PES 2016 finds the perfect blend on the pitch while benefiting from some smart tuning off it. What a way to celebrate your 20th anniversary.
Kallie Plagge	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	 Like its predecessors, One Piece: Pirate Warriors 3 gives the Straw Hat Pirates the high-action Dynasty Warriors treatment, and it doesn’t change things too much this time around. In particular, the decent combat against hordes of enemies is largely the same as it is in One Piece: Pirate Warriors 2. However, unlike the last game, this one sticks to the canon One Piece story instead of telling a lackluster original one, and that sets it apart. It’s an extremely abridged story that has a bad habit of disrupting the battles just when they’re getting good, but Pirate Warriors 3 is fun overall and very well-suited to the waves-of-enemies “musou” style of battle.  One Piece the anime has reached over 700 episodes as of this writing, and it's still going. That's a lot of story to fit in 12 or so hours of an action-focused campaign, but Pirate Warriors 3 manages to do it — somehow — and even include an original ending. Even as I reached story arcs I barely remember or ones I haven't seen, I still was able to follow along and, most importantly, enjoy it. I adore the world of One Piece, and none of that spirit is diminished in shortening the story. Saying goodbye to the Going Merry still gave me feels, and playing as Luffy really made me want to help his friends when they were in danger of dying in battle.   I sometimes felt like playing was a chore standing between me and the next chunk of plot. Fitting in all this story context does come at a cost, however. Even though a lot of details are skipped or summarized, there’s still a lot of reading to do and cutscenes to watch. Battles are too frequently interrupted by these cutscenes, and the fighting drags as a result. Pirate Warriors 3 is a much faster way to experience One Piece than the manga or anime, but battles felt far longer than they actually were, and that didn’t help the sense of pacing.  I usually like the steady, focused grind of a Dynasty Warriors-style battle up until its boss, but interruptions break up that focus and turn it into tedium. With that and the lower difficulty in the first half of the campaign, I sometimes felt like playing was a chore standing between me and the next chunk of plot, rather than letting the story enrich the gameplay.  That’s not to say that the battles themselves aren’t any fun, though. One Piece’s often over-the-top style suits the musou genre perfectly — each character’s set of attacks both makes sense for who or what the characters are and also for the Pirate Warriors’ kind of battle. All of them are capable of mowing down 50-plus enemies at once, and it’s consistently satisfying once the challenge picks up a little.    It looks pretty cool to destroy 100 enemies with one blow. My favorite part of battling was experimenting with teammate combo attacks. Any crew member who’s taking part in a battle can be rotated into a kind of partner slot, and with the right combination of attacks, your partner will come in and strike with a finishing move. Playing as Luffy, I could “gatling gun” punch a swarm of opposing Marines and bring in the swordsman Zoro for the kill. Teaming up with the skeleton Brook launches a kind of musical attack, and Nami uses weather. It further enhances the crewmate solidarity aspect that’s so central to One Piece, and it looks pretty cool to destroy 100 enemies with one blow. There’s also plenty to do in Pirate Warriors 3 outside of the main story. There’s a semi-random “dream log” mode, for example, in which you can unlock extras to help you level up your characters’ skills. It’s smart, because the only other option is grinding in completed story mode levels. It’s a nice break from the main campaign when needed, and playing as any unlocked character freely is always a nice touch. Of all the ways to experience One Piece — a daunting task, considering how much of it there is — Pirate Warriors 3 isn’t a bad choice. It does its source material justice, and the heavily condensed canon story is as fun to experience as ever. One Piece’s unique style of fighting also translates quite well to musou combat, but fitting in the story bogs down that combat somewhat. Instead of enjoying both fighting and dialogue, it became a weird kind of chore to play through battles just to progress the story.
Nathan Lawrence	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/04/rugby-world-cup-2015-review	 Late last year, I reviewed Rugby 15: an arcade rugby union title from HB Studios with few noteworthy qualities. You can read my review here, but the long and short of that experience is that Rugby 15 was a stinker. Fast-forward nine months, and the same developer is releasing much the same game, with many of the same flaws as Rugby 15, plus some new ones. I was initially excited to see that HB Studios had attempted to address some of the concerns of Rugby 15. The static tutorial screens are still there, but they showcase additional rugby union nuances atop last year’s offering, as well as some minor but important default control changes. There’s a practice mode now, but the free play option is redundant (you might as well play a friendly match), while the focused training sections are short in quantity and shallow in quality. The AI-controlled players no longer stand around waiting for you to move before they’ll react, which is an improvement over last year. Unfortunately, more movement from the AI highlights the lack of attention to proper or even practical rugby defensive/offensive formations. You can use the D-pad to cycle between offensive and defensive presets, but this is never explicitly conveyed (I stumbled on it in the controls menu). It also doesn’t alter the atrocious AI. On one hand, it’s technically easier to score a try, as there’s the option to touch the ball down, on top of a diving mechanic that doesn’t make the ball-handler leap over the dead-ball line (as it once did). On the other hand, most of my tries were scored when I was tackled over the line due to the returning sin of player encounters being determined prior to the animation playing out. In practical terms, this means unresponsive controls when the game has determined that you’re about to be tackled. Worse than this, though, is the game-breaking bug that happened to me on multiple occasions, wherein being tackled over the try line resulted in completely unresponsive controls and the inability for my opponent to interact with me. On a couple of occasions, I was able to get the player back on his feet by cycling in and out of the menu, but I still couldn’t pass the ball or be tackled. On another occasion, frantically button mashing seemingly repaired the damage and allowed me to complete my try. The other times, I had to simply run over the dead-ball line to reset play. I could have quit out of these matches in question, but doing so during the titular Rugby World Cup tournament, the main mode and selling point for this game, would result in a forfeit, registered loss (of 0-30, no less) and eliminate me from the qualifying rounds. That’s hardly a practical option considering friendly matches and World Cup mode are the only two modes on offer in the game outside of free-play practice. New gen graphics. On the positive-on-paper side, the all-important ruck isn’t as buggy as it was in Rugby 15. Alas, in execution, it breaks down at the ruck breakdown. Considering the rucks are arguably the most important part of a rugby union game, particularly because of how frequently you’ll encounter them in this game, it’s a terrible oversight. The right-stick mini-game for rucks returns, but setting the difficulty above the lowest level, which is laughably easy, means you have next to no chance of a turnover. Retaining possession at the ruck breakdown isn’t overly challenging once you wrap your head around the system and learn to anticipate the prompts, but upping the difficulty to normal or hard only seems to reduce the chance of scoring a turnover. It means that rucks are a much faster mechanic than in Rugby 15, but the emphasis on speediness results in a lot of frustration and an overall lack of control. Rucks are a much faster mechanic than in Rugby 15, but the emphasis on speediness results in a lot of frustration and an overall lack of control.  Even playing with or against someone locally doesn’t fix this problem (there’s no option for online play). The ruck meter fills too quickly to afford either side a practical chance to genuinely steal or regain possession, so it descends into a game of luck and quick reactions. Trying to secure or rake the ball too early means you run the risk of earning a penalty. Considering the referee is extremely heavy-handed with pulling out yellow cards for ruck infringements, this is once again a slap in the face for the most crucial part of a rugby union game. Hell, you can’t even manually add or remove players from a ruck, and a defensive player advantage on a runaway opponent counts for nothing as both teams politely wait for an equal amount of players to join the ruck before you can interact with it. The only real improvement in terms of the ruck is the option to perform a short pass, instead of the lobbed-back throws of Rugby 15 that often resulted in lost metres. Rugby World Cup 2015 doesn’t teach you this, but you have to hold the left stick forward while pressing the short-pass button to give your attacking players a running start. That said, even this mechanic would fail to register half the time. Ruck this. Friendly AI is as bad as the opposition, and I regularly experienced immense frustration as I watched them stuck in the lack of mud (there’s no rain in this game) as a ball-handler ran around, between or even through them. To further complicate matters, the automated player selection button while defending often illogically selects a defender nowhere near the attacker. You can manually select them with the right stick, but even this misses as much as it hits. The right stick is also used to control manual pass selection and defensive manoeuvres when in possession of the ball, so the game will often miss the intended input of the latter and associate it as being pre-emptive to the former. The result: more blood-curdling frustration. It’s as if HB Studios knows how bad the friendly AI is because there’s the option to relinquish ball possession to an AI player in order manually move into a running position. This is more confusing than practical, and you often don’t have time to properly position before the AI-controlled teammate is tackled. It becomes an almost essential mechanic, though, when you consider that neither defenders nor attackers put players into the blindside of a ruck, which leaves huge gaps, but little opportunity to capitalise on these moments. Kick it to the curb. I could go on. I could mention how the way the game handles camera rotations and, subsequently, rucks in end-on perspective destroys momentum and further damages already finicky gameplay systems. I could go on about the delay between a button press and its actual recognition, which destroys the limited immersion during rare moments of forward momentum. I could fixate on how play basically stops to a crawl when there’s a loose ball, how interceptions are almost impossible, or how forward passes seem to work on a cooldown rather than them actually being legitimately called. But there’s really no point. Rugby World Cup 2015 is a (slightly) retitled version of the same sloppy rugby union game from 2014 that reeks of a rushed release punted out the door in time for the actual World Cup. What it sets out to achieve on paper, in terms of addressing some of the issues with Rugby 15, is initially admirable. But, ultimately, when you start to play, all it amounts to is an attempted sidestep around the messy maul of last year’s game, that’s quickly tackled back onto the same unattractive heap.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	 When I reviewed Tearaway on PlayStation Vita back in 2013, I loved it, giving it a score of 9.3 (‘Amazing’). Here’s what I wrote: “Tearaway is a joy. Whether it was riding a pig towards the sunset or playing basketball with a super-powered accordion, it never failed to make me smile. It sincerely believes that imagination really is the most important faculty... It does this by using every aspect of the Vita, crafting an experience that I can’t imagine being realised elsewhere. It might be short but it’s very special.” Tearaway Unfolded is a different experience, though. While the skeleton of the original can still be detected, Unfolded is best thought of as part-remake, part-adaptation. And it does a great job of realising the potential of its new hardware: familiar environments are generously expanded, made more bustling and beautiful; instead of the Vita’s assorted cameras and touch screens, the peculiarities of the DualShock 4 are celebrated in novel and enjoyable ways. The adaptations are smart, and go someway to realising the core experience on another, very different platform. Yet not all of the changes work as well. So much new content is added, the overall experience is altered, and the intimate charm of the original is lost in translation. One thing that definitely benefits is Tearaway’s striking and unique art style, which looks better than ever. On a bigger screen, running at a higher resolution, it’s easy to appreciate just how well-executed this world made entirely of paper really is. Tabs of glued down paper flutter in the wind, or bounce up and down as you run by. Step in a pool of water, and a ripple of jagged, torn paper will appear. It feels hand-made, a world shaped by scissors and glue. But it’s not just decorative; paper is folded in surprising and smart ways to create environments and obstacles. It's not just a superficial choice, but one which informs every aspect of the world. With this arts and crafts ethos, it's unsurprising that Tearaway’s biggest message remains the celebration of creativity, and as such you’re often asked to design small parts of this landscape. These range from relatively ordinary requests, like outlining the silhouette of a snowflake, to far more surreal commissions, like designing a majestic crown for a theatrical squirrel. This is all done by sketching on the DualShock’s touchpad. It’s surprisingly accurate, but given its limited size it’s tricky to realise more detailed designs. I often found my sketch prematurely coming to life because my finger had accidentally slipped off the touchpad. The PlayStation App on phones and tablets can be paired with Tearaway Unfolded, giving you a far bigger canvas. Either way, seeing your design for a snowflake suddenly appear in the world – multiplied a thousand times, fluttering down as a you scale Gibbet Hill – is still a magical experience, and one few games offer. Similarly, you can use the PlayStation camera (or a device running the PlayStation App) to import a texture into the world. I transformed an albino stag using the carpet design from Stanley Kubrick’s Overlook Hotel. Again, that's something you don’t get to do all that often. Similarly, I've yet to play a game that makes better use of the DualShock 4 and its more unusual features. Light bar, gyroscope, touch pad: each one is used as the basis for a new mechanic. The light bar, for instance, is used to illuminate the darkness and interact with plant life, creating new platforms, while the gyroscope grants precise control over a certain type of platform. Swiping a finger across the touchpad creates forceful gusts of wind, capable of erecting new platforms, blowing down others, and whisking away enemies. Each mechanic is given its moment in the spotlight, but occasionally, these new control schemes combine with more familiar ones to create original and surprisingly demanding sections of gameplay. 'Unfolded' is an interesting word when talking about adaptation. Of course, it immediately brings to mind some sort of expansion, and there's plenty of areas in Tearaway that really benefit from this approach. It's the same experience, but it just feels like it's taking place on a bigger scale with a bigger budget. Familiar areas, like Maypole Fields, have more depth and detail, and more jolly NPCs to carry Tearaway's festive spirit. But 'unfolded' also implies that something is being revealed, and Tearaway Unfolded doesn't disappoint with several new areas to explore, from moors and laboratories to spooky swamps. In fact, I recognised very little from the final third of the campaign. This would be great, but it’s not seamless expansion – the fold lines are still visible, and old and new design fail to really connect. The Vita version focussed on a messenger delivering a special message to you, the player. Tearaway Unfolded retains this overarching design, but in the interest of offering new content – and presumably a ‘bigger and better’ experience – it takes several detours into new content. There’s a whole subplot regarding your enemies, known as Scraps, building their own DualShock controller. It’s great, and gives rise to some delightful breaking of the fourth-wall, but ultimately it’s a detour. In fact, a lot of these new sections, including my favourite which takes place entirely within your controller, feel bolted on or squeezed into the frame of the original – a way of extending the length of the campaign but one that doesn’t really serve the underlying story. In fact, these new sections while fun introduce pacing problems which undermine the overarching story. And this certainly isn't helped by levels being broken up by frequent scrap battles which can't be avoided. Instead of enemies just inhabiting the world, they ambush you in areas which suddenly become fenced in. Before continuing, you must defeat wave after wave of scraps. The execution and frequency of these encounters make them feel more like a chore than a platform to play with abilities. Tearaway Unfolded successfully translates so many aspects of the original. It remains a distinctive experience which celebrates creativity and fun with undimmed enthusiasm and invention, and along the way asks you to do things very few games do – whether that’s designing a snowflake or christening a baby wendigo. It takes a familiar controller and makes you play with it in a different way. Its new areas unsurprisingly offer fun and fresh ideas, but they definitely feel crammed into the narrative of the original which suffers as a consequence. Tearaway Unfolded is a big and bold adaptation, but lacks some of the original's intimate charm.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	 At its best, Until Dawn is a gleefully cheesy homage to horror movies, set in a world built by a developer that clearly adores the genre. Although its thrills are tempered by a lack of story cohesion, its robust choice-and-consequence system and keen eye on horror’s most ridiculous tropes makes Until Dawn ultimately worth playing.   Developer Supermassive Games has threaded horror movie cliches into Until Dawn’s set-up and amplified them to extreme degrees. Eight attractive stereotypes, played with great gusto by a well-rounded cast that’s a little too good for the material, have gathered together to “party like porn stars” in a remote cabin on the top of a snowy mountain that can only be accessed by an unreliable cable car. Why are they there? To mark the one year anniversary of the mysterious disappearance of their friends in the surrounding woods, naturally. Until Dawn’s game world is small, but Supermassive has made it as entertainingly hostile as possible. Its beautifully detailed cabin is huge, cold, and full of secrets, while the surrounding area features a sanitorium with a large morgue, an abandoned mine shaft, and a range of aggressive wildlife. This bitter landscape is filmed with a keen eye on isolation, and Until Dawn does a great job at encouraging the sense you’re always being watched through high angles and tracking shots. It’s a ridiculous place to spend any length of time, of course, and during its first half Until Dawn really revels in the slasher genre’s idiosyncratic idiocy. Characters take baths with their headphones in. Couples go to dangerous lengths to have sex. Everybody seems to think scaring the hell out of each other is really ‘fun’. While I wish Graham Reznick and Larry Fessenden’s script had been more acerbic overall - sometimes I wondered if the bad jokes were intentionally bad jokes - I enjoyed Until Dawn’s familiarity, from the dumb jock arguing with the bad boy over the queen bee to Hayden Panettiere's character being stuck in a towel for half the run-time.   Such gleeful abuse of genre tropes does dilute Until Dawn’s scares significantly - I laughed more than I flinched - though there is the odd bit of clever misdirection resulting in genuine shocks. Supermassive has an excellent handle on the visual language of horror movies, and Until Dawn is at its most scary when a character is ever so slowly backing out of a doorway, or approaching a rattling trap door. Until Dawn can’t quite sustain its tongue-in-cheek tone through its ten-ish hours, however, and its story veers off in an entirely different direction in a much darker and sillier second half (which owes an awful lot to a certain British horror flick). While there are still some tense moments to be had here, this sudden shift strips away any cohesiveness and left me feeling like I’d played through two very different - and discordant - games.   Fortunately, Until Dawn encourages a more consistent sense of tension elsewhere. Your goal is to save (or kill?) as many characters as you can over the evening as possible, and every decision they make under your control shapes their fates. Bend a weapon out of shape? Don’t expect to have it later when you’re under attack. Be cruel to another character? You won’t have his support when you need it the most. Some decisions I made in Until Dawn had minor consequences, some left me genuinely shocked, and all felt satisfyingly connected to an action I had made. I played through twice to mess around with its systems, and was delighted to find new storylines and information I’d missed the first time around by choosing different options.  Quick-time events play a big part in Until Dawn, too, and though occasionally tedious - there’s far too much climbing over walls for my liking - there are real repercussions for failing. Some of Until Dawn’s most thrilling moments came when I was being pursued and had to make split-second decisions on my method of escape, all the while trying not to fumble at a prompt which would result in my immediate capture or death. It’s worth noting I had a tough time with Until Dawn’s motion controls during these frantic sections, and as they brought nothing to the experience elsewhere, I’d recommend sticking with traditional controls. Less successful is an odd bit of fourth-wall breaking theatre that has a more obtuse effect on Until Dawn’s story. ‘Doctor Hill’ (performed by Fargo’s Peter Storemare) is a psychiatrist who will talk to you directly in between chapters, at first ascertaining your fears and teasing out your thoughts on each character. How you answer him has a subtle effect on Until Dawn’s early scares - you’ll encounter a needle if you tell him you’re scared of needles, for example - but his role quickly descends into a strictly thematic one, which becomes redundant as the story takes that hard left-turn. Until Dawn is a flawed, but fun experience. Though an unfocused story means it falls short of greatness, it’s an otherwise entertaining homage to the curious traditions of horror movies which pays off your in-game decisions with occasionally shocking consequences.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/20/gauntlet-slayer-edition-review	" When IGN first reviewed Gauntlet on PC in 2014, we gave it a score of 6.8 for ""Okay."" Here's what we said then: “Gauntlet can't quite strike the balance between the nostalgic arcade experience and a modern-day replay-friendly adventure. It's cool that there's such a varied experience amongst the iconic quartet of heroes, and four-player co-op is almost always fun with the right crew, but its repetitive structure works against its longevity.""   For all of the improvements that come with Gauntlet: Slayer Edition (a free update for the PC version and a standalone $20 release on the PlayStation 4), repetition is still this demon's greatest weakness, though it's not quite as big a killer as it was before. The core campaign is still the same set of levels leading up to a boss battle, though many bonus levels have been added to freshen the experience should you seek more gold. While it's purely aesthetic, the icon-based map (think Super Mario Bros. 3) that lowers deeper and deeper into the underworld actually adds some personality to the drab hub area of the original release. There's also a few new modes like Endless, where you can take on waves of enemies until you die (collecting much gold in the process) and a daily Colosseum challenge that earns you even more gold, as well as new clothing for your character. Endless is a bit of a treat -- there's some nice decision making at play, as you can buy spells and healing items on each floor if you don't mind paying a premium. Since the floors are doled out randomly, there's a bit more intrigue and variety when tackling Endless in comparison to the campaign's sameyness.  The combat itself is a bit more diverse than it was a year ago, now that each character has additional specific powers that change when you buy a new weapon. For example, you can buy a variant of the Elf’s potion bomb where he drops a weaker bomb but does an acrobatic flip over enemies in the process. The one downside to these great new cooldown-based moves is that they must be purchased individually with hard-earned gold, you never quite know what you're getting due to the sparse in-game explanations. Having the ability to test the new combat skills in some sort of tutorial arena out before buying would have lessened my buyer's remorse for some of the less-impressive powers. Speaking of less-impressive, The Wizard remains the black sheep of the quartet and still has a steep learning curve when adventuring alone; the other three characters included in the purchase are balanced enough to use solo. Fortunately, Gauntlet is great fun when it comes to couch co-op where you know the folks you're stealing potions from, though online campaigning is still entertaining (and most importantly, stable). While the Endless and Colosseum modes are nice additions, they still can't completely make up for the shortness of the campaign which will take 5 or so hours (and less if you're playing with a skilled group). Increasing the difficulty doesn't make for any drastic change beyond the enemies taking (and dealing) more damage, so Gauntlet: Slayer Edition will likely only become a long-term dungeon crawl for those looking to buy every possible weapon, ability, and article of clothing for their chosen hero. Gauntlet: Slayer Edition streamlines the combat and adds a bit more replay value to last year's release, but there still isn't quite enough meat on this dungeon crawler's bones."
Brendan Graeber	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	 When a person decides to broadcast their virtual pilfering of the rich to inspire the poor to follow suit in the real world, is that person a hero, or a misguided fool? Volume asks some interesting questions about the antics of its protagonist in this simulated stealth game, and is able to back it up with a huge variety of rooms to plunder with simple-yet-challenging stealth mechanics to match. However, a few poor design choices might make you re-think the idea of pulling off these capers in the real world. Volume’s premise is both novel and unique: Using a forgotten (and decidedly humorous) AI, and a tool called the Volume, Robert Locksley reconstructs virtual rooms and areas to steal from. These rooms are taken straight from the archives of a power-hungry businessman-turned-ruler: Guy Gisborne (voiced by Andy Serkis!), and his many corrupt associates. Not content to merely replicate the act of stealing from these people, Locksley essentially live-streams his exploits across the internet, giving the downtrodden an opportunity to “take back what’s theirs” by following his literal walkthroughs. I enjoyed this odd quirky take on a futuristic live-streaming world, though the frequent references to “viewers”, “the internets”, and even a callout to Minecraft felt a little too on-the-nose.  The story - told through brief conversations during levels and in emails you can find along the way - can be a bit distracting if you’re busy trying to race the clock, but is worth a listen as it paints a vivid picture of futuristic Great Britain under the rule of a tyrant disguised as a simple businessman. Andy Serkis does a great albeit sparse job as a man fast losing patience with the boy you play as. I don’t want to spoil any story elements, but its worth noting that Volume does a great job at never outright glorifying your overall objective without providing a counterpoint to give you pause. What follows is one hundred bite-sized levels of stealth, distraction, and misdirection. Each isometric level is crafted around you from the ground up, as shards of polygons form stylish architecture, AI guards, traps, and scenery. Creeping around to the alternately soothing and tense melodies in Volume never got old. Almost every level feels like a new idea rather than a simple copy and paste job, and they blend new techniques with previously mastered concepts well, providing fresh takes on old tactics. While on your quest of virtual pilfering, moving unseen is just as important as tricking guards to leave their patrols to look for you. Certain level elements provide breathing room, like closets and floorboards to dive into - but the sheer amount of checkpoints per level took a lot of the challenge away, especially when excluding retrying segments, the time to beat a level averaged one to two minutes, and I could run through a dangerous room to a checkpoint on the far side and respawn with no pursuers. Shadows are also a nice concept, but make you virtually unnoticeable even when shoving pursuing guards out of the way. Add these concepts to the context of the story, and I would have to question the poor fools who think dark shadows will save them from gun-toting guards. Of course not all of these guards are created equal, as the long-range Archers in particular came off as a joke with their ridiculously slow firing rate and movement speed. I found myself not even bothering to sneak past them half the time.  Of course, for every misstep Volume makes, it more than makes up for it with clever use of both new and familiar stealth mechanics. Evading patrolling guards requires a keen sense of awareness - using cover to hide from their line of sight or utilizing gadgets like a silent sprint or the bugle: an item that can be bounced off walls to perform a noisy distraction while Rob crept by silently. Certain levels in particular - including a giant maze-like room with no cover to hide behind - made for some very tense subterfuge. Enemies and traps have enough variety to keep things interesting - like the Rogue with its great sense of spatial awareness and the Knight’s long range of vision and frightening movement speed. Many enemies synergized perfectly with defensive systems like laser alarms and creaky floors - forcing you to make some tough calls on stealth versus distraction. Even after the roughly 5-6 hour main story is finished, there’s still more to be done. Levels can be replayed for the fastest time leaderboards, and Volume’s level editor gives you nearly every tool you can think of - even if it doesn’t really explain how they work. Volume may suffer from a few issues of poorly designed AI and easily exploited level design, but I still found a great number of challenging rooms with an intriguing story to match, and plenty of room to master. The added bonus of being able to show how to complete a room by livestreaming a game about streaming how to complete a room… is just icing on the meta cake.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	 Dragon Age: Inquisition - The Descent is a challenging yet ultimately unsatisfying experience. While surviving hordes of Darkspawn and obtaining high-level equipment feels rewarding, the new story, new characters, and new environments are flat and uninspired, making this expansion feel more like filler than fun.  The Deep Roads are an important part of Dragon Age lore, so I was disappointed that The Descent does so little with it. After being sent to there to investigate a series of earthquakes, you’re subjected to a muddled explanation about Dwarves and their connection to massive entities known as Titans. None of it feels connected to the Inquisition, including Renn and Valta, two dreary new characters who lack the wit and spunk of their fellow Dwarves. They’re there to provide a bit of backstory and keep you informed of what’s happening as they guide you through the Deep Roads, but some of their explanations are frustratingly vague, especially near the end. Even my Inquisitor was perplexed: “I’m leaving with more questions than answers,” she mutters in the final scene. The Deep Roads themselves aren’t as fleshed out as they could be either, due to the lackluster level design. Each subterranean floor has a different look (a fiery hall, a blue cavern) which is a plus, but they all have a similar restrictive feel. The narrow corridors and slender cave tunnels offer little in the way of exploration, and when I came across a bridge that looked just like another bridge I had passed in an earlier location, I had an unpleasant flashback to Dragon Age 2’s recycled dungeons. The saving grace of this expansion is the combat, which offers a tough-as-nails challenge even for veteran players. Though fighting endless hordes of Darkspawn sometimes got a little too tedious (like fending off an avalanche of genlocks and ogres in a locked room for minutes on end), I ultimately appreciated the careful strategy needed to take down enemies like the immune-to-almost-everything Earthshakers.  Instead of mindlessly meleeing my way to victory, I had to find the right combination of spells and abilities to quickly take down their defenses and get the win before the next wave of Earthshakers attacked me. This gave me a newfound appreciation for the pause-combat feature, and I enjoyed being rewarded for my hard-fought victories with cool loot like Tier 4 armor schematics and plenty of gold. There’s a couple of extra quests available alongside the main mission, including unlocking hidden areas via the Deep Road expedition table and collecting gears to unlock special rooms, but they never felt all that deep or rewarding. Still, I did appreciate being able to send scouts out to collect rare items and up my Inquisition’s influence, which will certainly help me in future expeditions. Even with its nasty hard combat, it still took me less than ten hours to complete The Descent and its side missions. Though the loot I snagged has kept me from completely regretting the time I invested in The Descent, I don’t feel like it’s the best Dragon Age has to offer. Hopefully the next DLC will have more exciting environments and better answers to Dragon Age’s more pressing story questions.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	 There’s a little touch of theatre present in every encounter during a GALAK-Z mission. Your pilot’s enemy-specific quips become more urgent as fast-paced dogfights turn ever more dire, and your foes defiant retorts make it all the more satisfying when they dramatically burst into clouds of fire and metal - or all the more crushing when your ship does. It doesn’t offer quite as much visual or gameplay variety as I would have liked at times, but what’s there makes for an eminently playable - and replayable - space shooter.  At the end of the day, a great 2D space shooter is what GALAK-Z really is, despite some very light roguelike elements. Even though the power-ups you’ll find in shops or throughout the procedurally generated caves and space hulks will be different with every playthrough, and even the general gist of why you’re exploring space and blowing things up will be different (thanks to missions being selected from a pool at random), skill is ultimately – and rewardingly – paramount. You will live and die by your shooting and piloting skills rather than your decision-making or resource management; it works because the basic act of flying around and shooting everything that moves is a joy. You can chalk that up largely to the superb controls, which demand a sound understanding of multi-directional thrust. Once mastered, this system allows you to juke incoming fire and generally dance circles around your enemies like a Battlestar Galactica Viper pilot. Elements of the controls are carefully introduced one by one at first so as not to overwhelm, but taken as a whole the control scheme does a great job of making me feel like I’m actually piloting something. This is probably GALAK-Z’s greatest achievement, and the sense of skill and accomplishment it imparts is ever-present, and constantly increasing as you get deeper into the 25-mission campaign. That isn’t to totally discount the importance of the decisions you make regarding how to spend your (very) hard-earned cash. Like with other “Rogue-lites” such as Spelunky, you’ll find that certain upgrades, such as permanent health or shield increases, are crucial purchases, while others are more of a “nice if I find it for free” situation, and reasoning out which is which is both fun and useful. One nail-biting encounter that had me escaping a cave with an angry pirate lord’s stolen space map claimed my life over and over, until I decided to focus my upgrades on faster boost thrusters and a bigger tank of gas for them. In fact, I all but jumped up and cheered when I finally warped out safely. GALAK-Z is defined by these moments of triumph. Though there’s a wide array of cool power-ups to unlock and use (like shielding that has a chance to return projectiles back to sender), and even a fair bit of enemy variety, it never quite manages to make every playthrough feel like a dramatically new experience the way the best roguelikes do. That’s largely because of the inherently repetitive objectives: all the different mission types boil down to entering a procedurally generated structure, destroying/grabbing the objective, and getting to the warp point. You never have to think too hard, or make any truly creative use of the upgrades available to you. Even the different biomes used to generate levels aren’t too meaningfully different from one another, either visually or in terms of the challenges they present. It never stops GALAK-Z from being enjoyable, but it does make it feel a touch repetitive when you’re attempting the same run for the third or fourth time.  Even if the environments are a bit sparse and samey, the overall TV show presentation motif picks up the slack, imbuing GALAK-Z with a peppy personality that, as a big sci-fi fan, I found irresistible. From the opening splash screens to the characters themselves, everything is injected with equal parts Saturday-morning-cartoon sass and lovably cheesy ‘80s science fiction tropes. Little details from the way main character A-Tak’s portrait glows with every laser shot to the silly, randomly generated episode and author names at the start of each mission give GALAK-Z an irresistible charm. Though GALAK-Z’s roguelike elements are fairly basic and stripped down, they do succeed in adding extra layers of challenge and replayability to an excellent space shooter. Progressively mastering its wonderful controls and unlocking new upgrades had me totally hooked, and even though its idea of mission variety is something of an illusion, its smart, playful personality kept me too entertained to care.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	 For a span of five hours, Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture transported me to one of the most detailed, fully realized worlds I’ve ever experienced in a video game. It builds a potent sense of place, populates it with rich characters, and delivers a fantastic mystery that culminates in a powerful payoff. It’s a wonderful way to experience a story, though Developer The Chinese Room is overzealous in making sure we take in all the atmosphere and story by slowing movement speed to a rate that seems to actively disrespect our time and patience. [UPDATE: After our review of Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture went up on IGN, The Chinese Room put up a blog post addressing the speed issue. Turns out you can sprint! ...but it requires holding down R2 for seven seconds before your character begins to speed up. Because it was a hastily added change late in development, there is no in-game prompt for this yet, and the only way I know this is from reading the blog post. Regardless, it’s a poor implementation of a strange design decision - not only is it so well hidden you’d never know it was there, seven seconds is a long time to walk when you want to be running. It’s certainly a relief that sprint exists, though.]   From the beginning, Rapture utilizes a slew of effective storytelling techniques to get across its intriguing and affecting tale of a quiet English village whose inhabitants suddenly begin to disappear into swirls of light. Well-written audio diaries, fantastic character interactions, and environmental storytelling clues all come together to build a great, mysterious tale. Tiny details litter the environment that help add depth to the characters, world, and story: a pair of crutches lay abandoned outside a church, a picnic sits half-eaten on a hillside, and tennis rackets lay strewn about a court as if abandoned mid-game. I felt compelled to explore every nook and cranny, as doing so almost always added another piece to Rapture’s impressive, mysterious puzzle. I really loved how my theories regarding the mystery kept evolving throughout my playthrough -- I continually oscillated between hypothesizing that the events were rooted in religious, alien, or human-caused reasons. It felt just as great when a turn of events proved me wrong as it did when one proved me right. Rapture’s cast enters and exits the story in the same way characters do in a skillfully directed ensemble movie. I really appreciated the way it trusted me to find bits and pieces of a person’s life out of order, and figure out how they all fit together without holding my hand. Throughout the five hours I was introduced to six major characters, each of whom have really interesting backstories that felt great to slowly gain an understanding of. Discovering the arc of how a God-fearing priest comes to terms with his creator in the face of such unexplainable events, or how a lone American, thousands of miles away from home, dealt with being an outsider in this quaint village led to some really powerful, memorable character moments. Piecing together how each major player deals with the events of Rapture provides a complex and rewarding portrait.   All of this is heightened by a fantastic score that punctuates the bigger moments with booming, hymnal music, which in a world completely devoid of human life, ends up taking on a life of its own. Haunting ambient noises that almost come across as the voices of those who vanished in the event pepper the world, reminding you that this place wasn’t always so empty. Likewise, there’s some really smart sound design at play that subtly guides you toward points of interest. For instance, when you approach a radio or telephone (which act as audio diaries), you’ll begin to hear soft humming and static. While Rapture never holds your hand, it also takes steps to make sure you’re never too lost in its world. Actual game mechanics are about at sparse as they come -- aside from moving around the world playing “collect the scattered objects,” the only means of interaction in Rapture are a single button that opens doors and turns on radios, and some slightly obtuse tilt functionality. The world is littered with floating balls of light that unfold into short vignettes that show you a brief moment from before the apocalyptic event occurred; in order to activate the more important ones, you have to tilt the DualShock 4 and find the right frequency of the light, as if you’re tuning a radio. Rapture doesn’t do a great job of cluing you in on what to do in these situations, and it took me a few hours to actually wrap my head around this form of interaction. In a tight experience where everything else felt necessary, these tilt moments felt a bit shoehorned in.   Exploration is the real gameplay, and so it’s valuable that this world is open right from the start. If you want, you could rush straight towards the finale and reach the conclusion without piecing together its story. Well, maybe “rush” isn’t quite the right word, because movement speed is Rapture’s most prominent problem. Your character walks at an achingly slow pace -- honestly, the movement speed is slower than nearly any first-person game in recent memory. This problem doesn’t really boil over at first, as I adored poking around each inch of the world in search of new scenes, clues, and details. But as you progress further into the environment and spaces start to become more and more open, it began to feel like Rapture lost respect for my time. This is especially frustrating when you realize that you missed an area of interest a ways back, and going to explore it means a solid 10 minutes of backtracking at a snail’s pace with little to do on the way – and even more aggravating when you think about how easy it would be for the developers to fix this. Its a testament to Rapture’s high points that I was willing to power through this frustrating limitation and still really enjoy my time. When the pieces of the story finally began to come together, and I started to actually realize what was going on in the world, I was hit with an immense feeling of satisfaction. Even the most earth shattering of these revelations are presented in a way that’s painfully melancholy, but I wholly appreciated that Rapture made me actually feel connected to these characters and this place in a way that stirred something in me, which is a task not very many video game stories have managed to accomplish. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture excels at building a dense world, evocative tone, and rich cast of characters. Its five hours are filled with some really great exploration, discovery, and memorable moments. Piecing together its web of heartbreak, loss, and ultimate revelation provides a great experience. Everybody’s Gone to the Rapture rewarded my patience with a fulfilling journey. [Editor's Note: In light of the new information about the hidden sprint feature, we've taken the unusual step of raising Everybody's Gone to the Rapture's score from an 8 to an 8.5, in order to bring it in line with the revised text. This is not to suggest that sprinting is worth .5 points (scores are not math, and there are no set additions or subtractions for any given feature or bug) but a reflection of the reviewer's opinion of this game in the factually accurate state in which it existed at the time of review.]
Jared Petty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	 Laying aside traditional video game cornerstones of risk, challenge, and combat, Submerged produces a pleasant, remarkably subdued exploration experience. Intrigued by its strange, almost serene overtures, I found myself caught in the quiet, eagerly anticipating my next discovery as I wandered the macabre avenues of a sunken civilization. Some of what I found revealed disillusioning limits to this world’s scope and polish, but overall the journey through a fascinating, haunted archipelago of mossy buildings lurching up through the rolling surf of a drowned planet was a rewarding pleasure.  Refreshingly nonviolent, Submerged presents no enemies, no obvious time limits, no failure penalties, and no way to die. Though my quest for medicines was a matter of life and death for a sick young boy, I was pleased to discover that the worst consequence I could expect for miscalculating was having to double back a bit along my route. Relieved of the need to proceed with wary caution, I was able to invest myself fully and without fear in Submerged’s aquatic playground. Despite the absence of combat, I quickly learned that I wasn’t alone in the apocalyptic oceanic ruins. Sea mammals, huge rays, sea birds, and strange carapaced humanoids shadowed my every move as I steered my little boat through the sunken streets; none are menacing, but all are peripherally present and adding a welcome sense of life and motion to the haunted, eerie landscape. Taken in as a whole, the city is lovely -- a series of jutting, ivy-gnawed spires stabbing out of phosphorescent waves. The water looks good, especially at night, presenting a glowing, murky miasma occasionally broken by whales or rays breaking the surface. I wished I could have taken a swim and explored the world beneath the waves, but for reasons later explained through the story, Submerged keeps your head above water. Closer inspection reveals an uneven, unpolished art direction that leaves different impressions at different times of day. Supersaturated colors flood over the seascape during a sunset, creating a vibrant, haunting, and otherworldly quality. Thunderstorms crop up suddenly, reducing visibility and silhouetting the rotting buildings in gorgeous electric flashes. Night reveals bioluminescent algae set against the blackness of a tumultuous sea. Viewed in the full light of a clear day, on the other hand, those same sights are sometimes less impressive. A blandness and aesthetic sameness in the building textures can be visually fatiguing, especially when you leave the boat for long climbing sequences when the camera faces away from the majestic cityscape. These climbs are simple affairs, with helpful paths to the main objectives clearly marked and few surprises along the way. I enjoyed the peaceful ascents, especially when I took my time, stopping at intervals and exploring the shadowy horizon with my spyglass. Without the threat of death, a timer, or any real chance of becoming lost, I was free to simply observe, listen, and find new story elements. The rewarding sense of discovery diminished somewhat as I became more familiar with the metropolis, but fortunately Submerged reached its conclusion after only three or four hours, long before things became too routine. The map is large enough for engaging exploration, but sadly a bit less vast than first impressions infer. I was disappointed to be turned away by the invisible boundaries at edges of the seemingly endless ocean -- I wanted to sail farther and discover new lands in the great oceanic beyond. Submerged avoids tedious exposition, telling its story in a gratifying silence. What few cutscenes I encountered were welcomely succinct, and instead, most of the storytelling takes place through a novel cave-painting picture book. Panels unlock as you discover vital hidden items, and each image unravels another piece of the enticing mystery behind your character and the fall of the great sunken city. Optional collectibles encountered during climbs reveal more glyphs, but the skyscraper environments themselves tell very little about the story. I wish there was more to find during ascents than just glyphs and eerie far-off vistas -- there’s nothing to suggest what used to happen in these locations, what kind of a places they were, and what the people who once lived her were like. Submerged attempts to replace tension with curiosity as a motivating force, and largely succeeds even though its environmental storytelling isn’t as dense as it could’ve been. It’s an unchallenging, occasionally beautiful experience that caters to our instinct to see what’s on the other side of the mountain. In the moments where Submerged rewarded inquisitiveness, I loved it. When it occasionally stumbled in that responsibility, I found myself wishing for a more polished and complete world to explore.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	 With its charmingly kooky story, and art direction that bursts with personality, Tembo the Badass Elephant makes a great first impression. The first couple of simple, breezy levels hint at a formula that could build to something memorable and masterful by the end. Though, as you might expect from a lumbering war elephant, Tembo stumbles a bit along the way with finicky controls. This platformer retains its joyful sense of levity throughout, but its level designs never really ramp up to much more than a good time.  Right from the jump, Tembo exudes an airy, Saturday-morning-cartoon vibe. Our heroic paramilitary pachyderm drops down into each new level with a satisfying thud and a triumphant trumpeting of his trunk, signaling the start of some wanton environmental destruction. The first couple of levels have you tromping freely through walls, husks of old cars, and enemy tanks alike as if they were made of LEGOs;  all this destruction is conveyed very well, with a comic book style “bada-bada-bada” wafting into the air with each step of Tembo’s charge, and destructible parts flying everywhere.  The opening levels feel very cleanly designed around the controls, too. There’s a clearly identifiable rhythm, which allowed me to achieve a speed run-esque fluidity; the kind of meter Sonic games reach for, but seldom achieve. This is an elephant who knows how to make an entrance. But past these early levels, that rhythm breaks down in a variety of ways. It would be harsh to say the early momentum is “squandered,” but Tembo doesn’t exactly build on it as the six-hour campaign lumbers on. Awkwardly spaced jumps, random hits from off-screen attacks, and enemies that force you to play a more measured game of pattern recognition bog down the pacing with increasing regularity through the second and third acts. There are moments when that early rhythmic zen returns, but it’s usually unceremoniously stamped out shortly after. Granted, Tembo is by no means bad when it slows down; it’s just considerably less fun than careening through levels with reckless abandon, which happened less and less frequently as I went. Note that some of those six hours were spent replaying levels since, somewhat annoyingly, some levels are locked until you’ve killed a certain number of enemies in each stage. The controls play into the stop-and-go pacing too. Everything feels responsive and enjoyable when you’re dashing in a straight line, butt-stomping through buildings and goring anything that gets in your way. Once the levels start calling for more careful platforming and the application of slide kicks, uppercuts, and water shooting, however, Tembo can feel as clumsy as an elephant on a conveyor belt. Jumps  alternate between feeling slow-moving and overly floaty, or too shallow and too long depending on whether you’re dashing when you leave the ground. Partially due to that inconsistency, stringing together all the different possible actions into anything cohesive rarely works the way it seems like it should. Almost everything has a wind up or some recovery time after, so it never feels like a slick, continuous flow of action.  Still, this staccato feel doesn’t prevent Tembo from being enjoyable; it’s just hard not to envision how much better it could have been with a few tweaks to maximize the high points and minimize the lows. One second you’re barreling through everything in sight and having a blast, and the next you’re stopping and backtracking to kill every last enemy so you can unlock the next level. The two don’t exactly complement each other, and one is clearly more enjoyable than the other. Tembo the Badass Elephant wants you to smile, and often, I did. Its charismatic protagonist, and the joy of stomping around and wrecking shop with him never got old, though the controls and level design would sometimes do as much to dampen the fun as facilitate it. Though it doesn’t always allow you to play it the way it seems to beg to be played, it still manages to be enjoyable overall until the credits roll.
Rob Zacny	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	 F1 2015 is the best version of itself on PlayStation 4, where developer Codemasters has largely lived up to the promise of current-generation hardware. It has excellent visuals and a seriously upgraded handling model that delivers some of the series' most authentic racing. But it's also a game that suffers from a lack of ambition, and some glaring omissions in terms of features, and broken multiplayer, with the result being an underwhelming racing game.  Our F1 2015 PC review covers a lot of those shortcomings, but in a nutshell: F1 2015 lacks major features that were standard from F1 2010 through 2013, including the career mode that let you develop your driver over multiple seasons and engage in heated battles with your teammate for dominance. It lets you race just a single season as a real-world driver (either the 2014 or 2015 F1 season) who of course can’t grow or change as you play. The handling model is refined in some key ways, like how it simulate grip and tire wear, but the cars in F1 2015 don't feel as aerodynamically sensitive or as demanding as they did in some earlier editions of F1, even on full realism settings. If I didn't stomp on the gas too hard, and paid attention to my tires, I felt like the cars were almost driving themselves around the track. That wider margin of error took some of the fun out of it. That's the bad news, and while it’s a big downer that makes F1 2015 tougher to recommend than its predecessors, there's also quite a bit of good to talk about. To start with, it's a sharp-looking game, with gorgeous, lifelike cars and convincing lighting that changes with the weather (and without the soft-focus look that made the PC version so disappointing). More importantly, the performance was very smooth throughout my time on the PS4. F1 2015 is a pretty great drive on PS4 (notably better than the PC version) — it may lack the features of previous versions, but it offers also some extraordinarily authentic driving on the track. Tire degradation and grip are modeled better than ever before in the series, and that can make for some very special racing that tests every aspect of your race craft. The rock-solid PlayStation 4 controller helps bring this to life, too, with an incredible level of granularity in the controls. I felt like I was getting as much out the throttle and steering controls as I would with a racing wheel. Aerodynamic modeling doesn't seem nearly as good, however. Racing in close proximity to other drivers, in turbulent air, doesn't feel substantially different from being alone in clear air. That's a pretty major thing to be missing from an F1 sim, where the cars are all about aerodynamic downforce. Still, fuel economy and tire wear keep things interesting on the track, to the point where I strongly recommend doing longer races (25% length or higher). I've had epic races in changing weather conditions where I was forced to adjust my driving style on the fly to make new tire strategies work. Getting performance out of a dying set of wet-weather tires for a crucial couple of extra laps, then switching onto high-performance slick tires just as the track dries off, and going on a tear through the field is one of those moments where you feel like you know what it is to be an F1 driver -- if only for a few minutes. That feeling goes away a bit around AI-controlled drivers, who are way too prone to getting into your back tires. It was annoying; I'd be having a great run through a corner, then I'd hear a thud and my car would start to spin out from behind as another driver nudged one of my rear wheels like a cop making high-speed takedown maneuver. Sometimes it was my fault, because I'd over-braked heading into the turn and slowed down too much, but just as often it was an AI driver diving back onto the track after running wide, or getting on the gas too early. And once they hit me, I noticed they just seemed to drive through, ignoring the contact entirely. A much bigger problem is the fact that the PlayStation 4 version of F1 2015 doesn't seem to have working multiplayer. Every time I tried to join a session, after a lengthy search, I would get a message that I had failed to join. This happened regardless of what type of game I tried to find. It just didn't work, which is a pretty huge blemish on an otherwise strong F1 game. Though deeply wounded by a poverty of features and broken multiplayer, F1 2015 puts its best foot forward on PlayStation 4. Great controls really let the strong handling and grip models shine, and it looks great. It’s easier to recommend as a single-player game, though you’ll need to watch out for its bumpercar AI drivers.
Miranda Sanchez	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/27/hatoful-boyfriend-ps4-review	" Back in 2014, I reviewed Hatoful Boyfriend on PC and gave it an 8.0 (for ""Great"") for its ability to make its silly premise meaningful through strong writing and great characters. Here’s what I said then: ""Hatoful Boyfriend doesn’t pass up on the stereotypical male roles of a dating sim -- the shy guy, the playful bully, the best friend, and the popular guy, just to name a few -- but it pushes its characters past their stereotypes and led me to care and sympathize with each bird’s story. Surprisingly, it’s not awkward to date the birds. Better yet, the protagonist is just as interesting as the birds she pursues. As a self-proclaimed hunter-gatherer and the only human in the school, it’s fun to learn about her interests and personality as she interacts with the birds.""  Above: Watch us play the PC version. While most of Hatoful Boyfriend remains the same as its PC original, the cross-buy enabled PS4 and Vita versions bring a funny new bird into the equation. Like the other eight dateable avians, the flamboyant golden pheasant Tohri Nishikikouji is well written and fun to interact with. Through Tohri we learn new information about Hatoful Boyfriend's most villainous partridge, doctor Shuu Iwamine. Tohri is out for revenge against Shuu for a past incident in a lab, and spends much of his time explaining his hatred for the doctor and comically plotting revenge with outrageous death rays. The pheasant is entertaining, but this new path is valuable because it, like the other paths, provides more context for Hatoful Boyfriend's surprisingly twisted world and further helps set the stage for the darker Bad Boys Love path. Note that the Vita version of Hatoful Boyfriend has some infrequent technical issues that aren't game-breaking, but certainly annoying. Every now and then music will turn into an annoying crackling sound, and some of the transitions between scenes will stutter while in the fast forward mode. These issues did not occur in the PS4 version. Both versions feature simple, easy-to-use controls. The Vita version does allow you to swipe through options with its touch screen, but ultimately it doesn’t make much of a difference. However, the cross-save feature is useful for jumping back and forth between the big screen and mobile play - being able to take my PS4 saves with me on the train is great. Unfortunately unlockable data doesn’t carry over, but trophies do. Dating birds may seem silly, but Hatoful Boyfriend nails its plot with the help of its well-written characters, and even surpasses its humorous premise with mysterious themes and dark undertones. Though Hatoful Boyfriend may have some mild technical bugs on the Vita version, the new Tohri path is a great addition to the dating sim."
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	" When I reviewed The Vanishing of Ethan Carter back in 2014, I gave it a score of 8.5, for “Great.” Here's what I said then: ""The Vanishing of Ethan Carter is an amazing achievement. Its story is powerful, its freedom is liberating, and its world is one of the most beautiful I’ve ever wandered around. Here’s to more games not holding your hand.""   Make sure to read that review, because nearly a year later, my thoughts on this atmospheric adventure game still stand. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was one of the most gorgeous games I have ever played when I reviewed it on PC back in 2014, and now that it’s on PlayStation 4, I can give it the same high praise on this system. The autumnal foliage looks gorgeous, the lighting helps create the beautiful but unsettling atmosphere, and gazing out onto the scenic vistas adds a great sense of place the whole setting. In short, Ethan Carter is a fantastic first-person exploration game that focuses on tone, freedom, and environmental storytelling in lieu of combat. You play a supernaturally powered detective on the trail of the titular missing boy in rural Wisconsin, and must piece together memory fragments to solve some great puzzles. These smart challenges reward you with bits of backstory, and the actual act of solving them fits in with the eerie Lovecraftian tone created by its beautiful environments.   Check out our original video review for the PC version of The Vanishing of Ethan Carter above. Aside from maintaining the same incredible visuals and great storytelling, Ethan Carter doesn’t require twitch reflexes, so the move from mouse and keyboard to the DualShock 4 doesn’t detract from the adventure at all. The Vanishing of Ethan Carter was an amazing achievement on PC, and remains just as great on PS4. Despite already knowing the solution to all of Carter’s puzzles, I still had a blast venturing back into its world and experiencing its powerful story once again. The writing is great, the atmosphere is effective, and emotional payoff at the ending remains satisfying. Here’s to more games not holding your hand."
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	 When IGN first reviewed Journey on PlayStation 3 back in 2012, we gave it score of 9.0, for “Amazing.” Here’s what we said then: “Journey celebrates the poignancy of nature, it startles you with the unexpected, and empowers you in an exhilarating, unforgettable conclusion. The hours spent completing Journey will create memories that last for years.”   Over three years after its original release, Journey on PlayStation 4 proves to be every bit as remarkable as it was when IGN awarded it Game of the Year for 2012. While the increase to 1080p and 60fps is definitely appreciated, what really shines here is the same concise, emotional, and gorgeous adventure that originally wowed us. Developer Thatgamecompany took the beauty of Flow and the meditative gameplay of Flower, and added an immense sense of scale in its third and most impressive game. In the length of a standard movie, Journey is able to consistently make me feel emotion in a way that few games ever have. At just over two hours long, Journey delivers an adventure that runs the gamut of human emotions. The awe that comes from cresting your first hill and spotting the mountain on the horizon is paired expertly with the fear that stems from exploring the ancient caverns beneath your destination. The playful curiosity of stumbling across a fellow traveler – another player having their own experience – and wordlessly cooperating with them to explore this world is only strengthened by the isolation and desperation that awaits near the mountain's frozen summit.  Without spoiling the ending, the visual and emotional catharsis that exists at the top of that mountain makes playing Journey a powerful circle that I want to constantly revisit. Whether you’re playing it for the first time, or revisiting it after three years, Journey remains one of the most powerful games in recent memory. With strong environmental storytelling, powerful music, and an emotional ending, it is absolutely a classic of the modern adventure genre. If you missed it on PS3, do yourself a favor and experience it on PS4. If you did play on PS3, you now own it on PS4, so this minimal graphical update is an excellent excuse to revisit it.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	 The idea of rocket-powered cars flipping through the air in Thunderdome-esque matches of cage-soccer sounds like the incoherent ramblings of a madman, but it turns out to be just crazy enough to work. Psyonix’s Rocket League, the follow up to Supersonic Acrobatic Rocket-Powered Battle-Cars, finds dumb fun in pulling turbocharge-assisted front flips in an ice cream truck, and the white-knuckle strategy in working with your team to control the giant ball on offense and defense. The fast and fluid absurdity of Rocket League fuses into one hell of a good time – despite servers that rarely work perfectly.  The main mode puts two teams of three in visually diverse but performance-identical vehicles (though 1v1, 2v2, and 4v4 variants exist) as they race up and down the pitch chasing the league’s oversized equivalent of a soccer ball. The great thing is, you don’t need to know anything about driving games or soccer to play. The rules are simple: drive really fast around bright, glossy, neon colored arenas and do fancy tricks while trying to smash an endlessly ricocheting ball into a deceptively tight space. The heart of Rocket League lives in that feeling of unrestricted movement. It’s thanks in large part to the use of what I would call “physics plus,” where the laws of gravity and momentum get a colorful overhaul to allow for driving on the walls and ceiling, and ridiculous mid-air direction changes that would liquefy the driver in the real world. But its fantastic movement is so arcadey and satisfying that I often have to remind myself to pump the brakes or lay off the tricks when a simple nudge or bump will do. And those tricks are the first surface-scratching glimpse at Rocket League’s layer of strategy under the ostensibly chaotic mashing of metal. Tapping your jump button puts you in the air, where tapping it again with a direction held performs a somersault, barrel roll, or bicycle kick. It might sound simple – and really, it is – but timing a strike to connect with a speeding ball, and controlling the direction you send it sailing, down to precise angles, takes some skill. There are real, potent levels of satisfaction to be tapped when you see a teammate lining up a shot from the corner and read the situation, slamming on the brakes to nudge the “pass” into the goal with a perfectly timed barrel roll. It’s electric. Outside of the frenzied and intoxicating gameplay, Rocket League has scant few features to flesh out the experience. The player-progression system – where winning matches, performing in-game feats, or doing anything really, earns you experience – unlocks a small stable of goofy cars or cosmetic decals and accessories. It’s fun to drive a truck wearing a sombrero, sure, but because there’s little or no mechanical difference between the dozen or so sportsters, trucks, exotics, a few concept models and at least one ice cream truck (exclusive to PS4 players), there’s no actual sense of progression that changes how you play a match. And while that’s all perfectly justifiable in the name of a level multiplayer playing field, I would have loved to see each car carry the strengths and weaknesses implied by their real-world counterparts: sport cars as speedy but hard-to-handle strikers, trucks and vans as slower but stronger defenders, and the balanced but all-purpose roamers somewhere in between. It seems like a missed opportunity to add a more meaningful connection to your cars in the garage, especially when making a squad to play through an entire season.  But there is a separate progression arc found in learning to use the surprising mechanical depth of Rocket League’s many controls and flighty physics. Whether that arc takes you through online competitive or ranked matches, easy-going exhibitions, up to four-player local cooperative play on split-screen, or all 36 weeks of a fully expanded season mode, the Rocket League experience is always about getting into the next throttle-pumping match. And while there are leaderboards to track your statistics and global prowess, Rocket League servers struggle to support the influx of PlayStation 4 and PC players hunting for same and cross-platform matchmaking bouts, rendering most of Rocket League’s online features – including the online party system – spotty at best. Fortunately, the AI is formidable on either difficulty setting above Rookie, both as teammates and opponents, so Rocket League doesn’t lose much in a completely offline existence, which is good, because its online suite is largely unreliable. Rocket League is a rare example where the execution of a simple, absurd idea is so strong and so engaging that it doesn’t need a ton of extra features around it. The rush of ripping across the pitch at full turbo to deny a shot on goal with a clutch bicycle-kick is enough to bring me back time and time again for just “one more match,” even without meaningful progression systems. Rocket League is a great, goofy, easy to learn and difficult to master action-sports game which demands that you grab a few friends and play a few rounds.
Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	 You’d think a game about an absurdly large radioactive dinosaur that spends half its time smashing urban infrastructure for fun and the other half duking it out with other bizarre monsters and robot versions of itself would be a sure-fire good time. Yet Bandai Namco’s latest attempt to capture that Kaiju magic in interactive form follows the trend set by almost every Godzilla game that has come before it: little more than some fan-pleasing movie references heaped atop a towering pile of mediocrity.   The first thing most people will probably notice is that Godzilla does not look like a current-gen game. While the character models of the Kaiju themselves look respectably good - particularly fan favorites like Mothra and Destroyah, as well as the several versions of Godzilla - the destructible environments that surround them are far from impressive. The city blocks in each area look as though they’ve been copied and pasted to fill space, aside from the few unique structures that mark the difference between one nondescript urban location and the next. Even in the midst of a monstrous rampage, these structures all explode and crumble in a similar fashion, breaking apart into the same standard chunks as the building before it. Even on PS3 or Xbox 360, I’d have described these settings as lackluster. Godzilla also suffers from a minor identity crisis. I can’t tell what it wants itself to be - a smash-and-go action game in the vein of Rampage, or a monstrous fighting game like the previous Godzilla game Destroy All Monsters. The main game mode centers around increasing Godzilla’s size by destroying as much as possible, specifically large power generators and other Kaiju. There isn’t much else to it beyond that: blow up the generators, kill the other monsters before they kill you. It’s not particularly challenging, either - the military tanks and planes were never more than a nuisance; and unless a rival Kaiju spawned at twice my current size (which rarely happens and may have been a bug), I barely saw the orange haze that appeared when Godzilla takes too much damage. After finally getting used to the unorthodox control scheme (I never thought I’d have to use two separate buttons to turn left or right after the advent of thumbsticks) I found crashing through a downtown area somewhat entertaining... for a while. Keeping a combo going while on a rampage essentially boils down to using the same few attacks over and over again, and thanks to Godzilla’s slow speed and ponderous controls, it’s easy to miss a step or get stuck turning around and lose your combo. Things get especially muddy once another Kaiju enters the picture: battles quickly became a frustrating game of chance that had me spamming the same five attacks, hoping that I would land more hits than my opponent. There is a blocking move available, but even the short time it takes to charge up renders it practically useless. I can appreciate a certain amount of novelty that comes with the slow-paced controls, but I’m supposed to be controlling Godzilla: King of the Monsters; I don’t think it’s supposed to actually feel like being a sweaty teamster in a rubber monster suit.  That said, the spirit of the old-school monster movie is where Bandai Namco absolutely nails it. Whether it’s intentional or not, the half-campy, half-deadly-serious spirit of the Godzilla films is alive and well in almost every aspect of this game. Dialogue from one of the four human characters is cringeworthy, but delivered with such sincerity that it becomes almost plausible. Also included is a massive compendium for fans that includes bios on almost every monster that has ever appeared in a Godzilla film. While it makes for some interesting reading material, you could probably find that info online, and it doesn’t make up for the game’s lack of substantial gameplay. The real downfall of Godzilla is its repetitive nature. In order to access other playable Kaiju, or an extended ending sequence, or any of the other dozens of unlockables, you can expect to be forced to play through the two main game modes many, many times. To unlock the endings, for example, you’ll have to find all the data locations in each arena - which you can only collect by playing through the branching campaign at least four times. Ordinarily this wouldn’t be a huge issue, as it only takes an hour or two to get through one run. Because the gameplay is so repetitive, though - smash, smash, smash, super, smash, smash, smash, super, etc - getting through each stage becomes more of a grueling endurance test than anything else.   In an apparent attempt to combat this monotony, there are a few game modes which offer slightly different experiences from the main God of Destruction missions. The most interesting is the Defense Mode, which casts players as a “friendly” Kaiju that must defend the world from Godzilla and other destructive monsters - but even then, it just boils down to beating up the other monster. There’s also the King of Kaiju mode, which challenges you to defeat six monsters as quickly as possible, a la a typical fighting game’s tower mode. Lastly, there’s a Versus Mode that lets you challenge another player to a 1v1 monster smackdown, using these same clunky fighting mechanics. None of these extra modes do very much to liven things up, since they’re still based on Godzilla’s slow-paced and often tedious gameplay. Apart from it’s massive roster of Kaiju and an encyclopedia of monsters, Godzilla's poor graphics, uncomfortable controls, and overly repetitive missions make this one of the worst renditions of the King of the Kaiju since he fought Matthew Broderick in Madison Square Garden back in ‘97.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/god-of-war-3-remastered-review	 When IGN first reviewed God of War 3 on PlayStation 3 back in 2010, we gave it score of 9.3, for “Amazing.” Here’s what we said then: “God of War 3 is a great end to Kratos' console trilogy. It's not perfect, with some uneven storytelling and progression here and there, but it's still a fantastic overall package. The combat is stellar once again, it's bloodier than ever, and it is one of the best looking game ever released. I still think God of War II is the best in the trilogy, but Sony Santa Monica did a great job closing up Kratos' journey for revenge.”   God of War 3 Remastered for PlayStation 4 recaptures the thrill of the threequel, thanks to the addition of 1080p resolution, a steadier frame rate that usually sits around 60 frames per second, and high-definition textures and lighting effects. These graphical touch-ups make Kratos’ final quest for vengeance against the Olympian gods even more beautifully gory (though not quite enough that it could pass for a game specifically built for the PS4). The “meh” plot remains a weak point, but the excellent combat and action-platforming reminded me why I love this ultra-gory series. God of War 3 is a strange place for Sony to start remastering the series, since it picks up right where God of War 2’s cliffhanger ending left off, and assumes you’ve played all the previous entries (including Ready at Dawn’s excellent Chains of Olympus and Ghost of Sparta for PSP). There’s a brief recap video, but it’s not quite enough to give you the context you need if you’ve never played before. That makes it tricky to recommend to the uninitiated, because newcomers may wonder why half the Olympians are already dead when the story starts, or why Kratos is so callous toward people who claim to be his allies.   Even knowing all that came before, I still consider God of War 3’s story to be the weakest in the trilogy. Specifically, I don’t like the way characters like Hermes and Hercules are introduced and summarily dismissed, and the anticlimactic ending still leaves a bad taste in my mouth. It’s hard to stay mad at a game that’s so pretty, though. God of War 3’s already impressive graphics aged reasonably well over the past five years, and are even better with modern textures and lighting. Walls in Olympia gleam more brightly and shadows in Hades flickr more ominously. Blood sprays through the air with the elegance of a leaping ballet dancer. Kratos, too, is much improved: his armor is wrought with fine detail and is oft-splattered in shiny gore. It may be strange to say violence has a beauty to it, but the glossy HD graphics make even the macabre pretty.   The only stumble in the graphical fidelity came when I ran into characters like Helios and Hephaestus, who for some reason weren’t given the same attention to detail as Kratos. Even with better lighting and color, their lower-res textures make them look a bit off, and serve as a reminder that this game was made for a previous generation of hardware. On the bright side, its last-gen origin also means everything runs much better. The original PS3 version of GoW 3 hovers between 30 and 40 frames per second during gameplay, which is nice, but the Remastered PS4 version is significantly smoother. It’s not locked at 60 frames per second, but it was usually up there, and never dipped to a noticeable degree.   Other than that extra layer of smoothness, Kratos’ combat mechanics aren’t tweaked in any way - but why should they be? They represent some of the best third-person action of their time, and they hold up well in 2015. Kratos can quickly switch between multiple weapons like Hades’ Claw and Apollo’s Bow with a simple tap of the D-pad or L2 trigger, combos are easily performed with simple combinations of face buttons, and other than the occasionally iffy platform jump and awkward flight sequence (which requires you to dodge and weave incoming objects while flying), Kratos moves responsively. The fixed camera was the only real issue I had; it’s tricky to fight a pair of minotaurs when there’s a giant pillar blocking the view, for instance. I also missed a couple of treasure chests, since there’s no easy way to pan the camera around and check for hidden crevices, though I was able to snag them by revisiting those rooms later.  I was happy to find the platforming still holds up well, and I had a good time using my Blades of Exile to leap over deep caverns, negotiate narrow cliffs, and avoid crumbling temple ruins. It’s during these moments that God of War 3’s sense of scale becomes jaw-dropping: Kratos’ hulking frame looks tiny compared to the stone statues of the Underworld Judges in Hades, and almost ant-like when he’s running atop Cronos and Gaia, Titans whose bodies are full-fledged levels. Most of the environmental puzzles are fun as well. They’re challenging, but never too difficult or frustrating. Certain stages, such as the Palace of Hades, are cleverly designed, with an array of levers and props like steaming cauldrons that lift Kratos high in the air. Some of the puzzle solutions struck me as unnecessarily brutal to the point of being a tad distasteful (like using an innocent woman as a literal cog in a wheel), but then again, this is Kratos we’re talking about here - at least it’s consistent with his character.   God of War 3 Remastered also comes with all GoW 3 DLC (including a couple of fun Challenge Modes that handicap you to make destroying enemies tougher), plus a new Photo Mode that lets you pause and take screenshots of Kratos in action. The latter is a cool concept, but I hate how mashing the wrong button during battle brings it up; it interrupts the action. The good news is that I got a couple of pretty awesome photos of Kratos raining gory terror on his enemies. God of War 3 was an impressive feat for its day, and it still impresses today in God of War 3 Remastered. Its beautiful graphics are prettier than ever, and a higher frame rate adds more fluidity to the action. The story will be confusing to newcomers, as it picks up right in the middle of the saga, but the exciting combat and epic set pieces hold up exceptionally well.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	 Big crossovers are usually about celebrating everything unique and exciting about the individual franchises involved, and yet somehow, J-Stars Victory Vs.+ manages to feel bland and routine. Though it pulls from 45 vibrant years of manga and anime history, everything from the story to the combat is conveyed in such a visually dull way that it robs the proceedings of the sense of spectacle befitting well-loved universes like Dragon Ball Z and Rurouni Kenshin.  Granted, this is a PlayStation 3 game that’s been mildly polished up for the PlayStation 4, but even compared to last-gen games like the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm series, J-Stars looks and sounds lackluster. I was ready to feel excited when pulling off signature ultimate attacks with my favorite characters, and for brief moments, I did. But all too often, the ugly-looking stages and rudimentary character models kept the fan in me from coming out to have a good time. As someone who could barely keep from yelling move names along with characters in Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle, I’m supremely disappointed with how J-Stars looks and sounds. Story mode is a huge letdown too. Instead of taking us through fan-favorite story arcs and iconic battles or building up to climactic what-if scenarios, all we get is a hum-drum tale of a parallel universe where characters from throughout the Shonen Jump canon all exist together, for...reasons. There are four arcs to choose, but they’re all essentially the same except with different playable characters. And if you want to switch from one story to another, you’re essentially starting from scratch, so there isn’t much reason to play all four. Even one time through the four- to six-hour campaign felt like too much. All you really do is wander around the overworld, heading to the next bland fight on your map with a bunch of bland story filler in between. At key points, you’ll get an upgrade for your ship that allows you to explore more of the map, but there really isn’t anything to see other than brief, throwaway cameos from different manga characters looking to fight you in order to “train.” It’s Sonic Adventure syndrome, where gameplay is just too broken up by clumsily executed light-adventure elements to ever settle into an enjoyable rhythm. The story isn’t even presented in an interesting way. There aren’t any cutscenes once you’re past the spectacular opening one, and very little voice acting in general. Most scenes boil down to static portraits and plain text, mainly made up of characters straining to work in show references to remind us, the fans, that they know we’re watching. Oh look, it’s Naruto, and he’s fighting to become the next Hokage and he can’t wait to eat at Ramen Ichiraku afterwards. Thanks for reminding us! Luffy can’t go a single scene without mentioning that he wants to become the Pirate King. For the non-anime fan, just imagine a Batman game where Bruce won’t stop talking about how he’s motivated by the death of his parents, and you have an idea of how reductive J-Stars’ portrayal of its characters feels. It’s all very slapdash and thrown together with little reverence for the great shows and books the characters come from.  I could forgive a lot of this if there were a fun brawler underneath, but there isn’t. Even in its very best moments, J-Stars is merely a competent, simplistic brawler, unable to present interesting decisions to make or tactics to employ. There’s a ton of characters to unlock and play as, but they mostly feel disappointingly similar. A couple of support characters have novel abilities, but I easily settled in to one or two really effective attack chains and stuck with them – it’s kind of like playing Dynasty Warriors, but without the thrill of downing hundreds of foes at a time. Mobility is surprisingly stilted too, considering the abilities of the characters involved. Everyone can double jump, which is fine, but dashing is preceded by a brief startup time, and doesn’t allow you to change direction once you’re moving, so trying to get around at speed feels pretty clunky. In spite of the limited mobility, the camera still struggles to keep up with everything. Particularly when fighting up close in tight quarters, the camera doesn’t seem to know where to go, making certain stages nearly unplayable at times. Precious little of the Shonen Jump magic shines through the one-note fighting and poorly written story. It’s a shame, too, seeing as how diverse the character representation is (as opposed to focusing on the popular stuff). But even as a fan of Hunter x Hunter, Bleach, JoJo’s, and some of the other great series represented here, J-Stars Victory Vs.+ completely failed to ignite that fandom into a genuine desire to play.
Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	 A young girl searches for her missing father amidst a haunted manor, equipped only with her wits and a magic amulet that allows her enter the spirit realm. When I first heard the premise of Night Light Interactive’s 2D puzzle-adventure game, I was intrigued. As I progressed through the surprisingly short story that is Whispering Willows, however, I realized that aside from some excellent audio work and cool art direction, there was little to hold my interest.  The best idea of Whispering Willows is that our heroine Elena is able to astral-project herself into the spirit realm. This allows her to speak to other ghosts, possess and manipulate objects, and reach areas that she can’t get to in her corporeal form. It makes me wonder why that promising mechanic is so underutilized. The whole point of astral projection is to place yourself outside of your body and view the world from a new perspective, but Whispering Willows doesn’t seem to fully take advantage of that. While this idea is definitely present in many of the puzzles that require Elena to leave her body, more often than not my time was spent simply walking from one area to another and looking for an item that would unlock a new door, diminishing the importance of the out-of-body mechanic. The longest puzzle is a hedge maze, and the challenge is less about opening the right door and finding the right item than it is just trying to remember how the hell you got here in the first place. It’s just not terribly inventive. Where Whispering Willows excels is in its aesthetic. The sound design for each area of the estate is decidedly creepy, from Elena’s soft footfalls echoing off a creaking staircase to the rustling of leaves in the wind. Coupled with the somber tones of the score, it does far more to put us on edge than the cartoonish visages of the various ghosts do. The environments also give off a haunting feeling of foreboding, with candles and gas lamps casting eerie shadows across the derelict backgrounds. The character designs are interesting, and work well in the hand-drawn style - though the artwork loses its charm in the stiff motion-graphic-style cutscenes. Elena’s story isn’t exactly breaking new ground, either. Searching for her missing father was decent enough motivation for me to start guiding Elena on her journey through Wortham Willow’s crumbling mansion and the surrounding estate, but the lack of twists, turns, or interesting characters to encounter failed to keep me invested for even the three or four hours it took to complete Whispering Willows.  There are a number of notes and journal entries to collect that expand on the story of the victimization of Elena’s Native American ancestors at the hands of Willows and his band of settlers - some of which even posed some interesting ideas about whether or not it’s possible for someone to be genuinely good or evil. Unfortunately, these notes don’t seem to tie back into gameplay in any way, and simply provide additional reading material. While finding them definitely helps pad out under-developed characters, they didn’t leave any lasting impression on me. Whispering Willows is not without its strengths - it sounds great, is (for the most part) visually interesting, and there are a lot of good story ideas and potentially interesting puzzle concepts in play. However, thanks largely to a woefully short campaign and a lack of truly challenging puzzles, it ultimately doesn’t manage to create a particularly fulfilling experience.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	" PlanetSide 2 doesn't fit the mold of a free-to-play massively multiplayer shooter. There are no rounds to win, and hard-fought victories are often undone before the next time you log in. It’s tough to learn, progress is slow, and almost everything is prohibitively expensive. However, there are so many other things going for PlanetSide 2 that I keep coming back to it. The epic scale of its hundred-plus-player warfare, the sights of the world, and the variety of ways to approach battle as part of a squad and in vehicles made my experience well worth the growing pains.  Jumping in for the first time gives you an ambiguous start; beyond their uniform color, logo, and theme song, don't expect to learn much more about the motivations of the three factions. I chose the Vanu Sovereignty solely based on their Mass Effect-influenced design and theme song, but in the heat of battle I sometimes have trouble differentiating between my purple squadmates and the red-themed Terran Republic. The blue-clad New Conglomerate are a bit easier to distinguish, but I’ve grown to rely on the marking system to pick targets, even though my character yelling out the enemy's position and class essentially gives away my position. At the start, there's also little in the way of diversity in the player base, as many of the low-ranked troops have yet to start purchasing new character skins, though some of my more ornately designed Vanu teammates later on had shades of purple on their costumes that almost looked like New Conglomerate's blue duds. Other than being a friendly fire-hazard to my team, my first few hours in PlanetSide 2 were a bit rough; I wasn't leveled high enough to purchase access many of the military vehicles, I couldn't afford new weapons or accessories, and going it alone Rambo style wasn’t fun. Since the only way to establish new spawn points is to capture an opponent's base or drive around the lumbering Sunderer combat bus (which are easy targets for heavy weapons), the frustration of a quick death was often compounded by respawning hundreds of yards from the next destination. Adding to the woes of the solo player was the lack of feedback and tutorials provided at the outset. The only time I got concrete info about each class' skill was the first time I chose them, the minimap is confusing until you take the time to explore the large maps in the menus, and controls outside of the vehicles are never explained. It's all stuff I eventually got the hang of within three hours, but if there was a training area or expanded tutorials, I would have learned much faster. When I became more of a team player, my experience improved dramatically; thanks to the usually dependable ""Instant Action"" option, I got to warp directly to huge battles with player counts in the triple digits, and capturing persistent bases and checkpoints on the giant maps felt like an accomplishment. For as much as moving from one base to another can seem repetitive or meaningless, pulling out to the map of the entire continent and seeing a majority of the land in my faction's control instilled a sense of pride. Being a part of a squad increased my XP earnings, too, and even though people seem to rely more on the simple in-game order system instead of vocal communications, I felt a sense of camaraderie during quieter moments. Packing a bunch of troops into a Sunderer and leisurely caravaning across the plains between bases, or hanging out together exploring an empty base after crushing the opposition and taking ownership of the giant structure were the calm I needed just as much as the storm.  It also helped that after a few hours fighting on the relatively drab newb-only level-15-and-under continent of Koltyr, I moved on to explore the more alien-feeling regions like the arctic plains of Esamir or the arid deserts of Indar. There, the sights are a bit more breathtaking, and the more open layout with multiple paths to objectives didn't put me in the line of fire quite as often. That's not to say any of the four larger continents is anything approaching a cakewalk, since the level of competition in those locales is far greater. Likewise, I was impressed by the variety of combat options thanks to PlanetSide 2's diverse set of six playable classes. I started as the well-rounded jetpack-equipped Light Assault trooper, and when I got tired of straightforward running and gunning (and hovering), I could camouflage myself to snipe or do stealth kills as an Infiltrator, or work on taking out the enemy's big guns as a Heavy Assault. Every class has a pretty decent loadout at first, but getting new weapons was a bit of a trial - entirely new weapons cost a whole lot of the slowly earned Certification currency, and while add-ons like magnification scopes or night vision are considerably cheaper, you can't test any weapon or modification before purchase. A few times, something that sounded good in the menu text didn't quite meet my expectations.  Fortunately, my weapon woes didn't matter as much when I went behind the frontlines and helped out as a Medic or a vehicle-fixing Engineer. The change of pace from being actively engaged in firefights and relatively stress-free XP gained from keeping your faction running strong is a great way to decompress after an intense battle – though Medics and Engineers can still hold their own in a fight, should the need to fight arise. Taking a new approach by manning a vehicle or gun changes things up even more, with everything from ATVs and tanks to aircraft like fighters and dropships. Like the different classes, there's a steep curve to learning the controls, which are shown far too briefly when you get behind the wheel, and I did have some early frustration and vehicular mishaps that cost me a bunch of the slowly regenerating Nanite currency - it’s hard to learn to fly when cockpit time is so limited. However, playing as an armored Max suit and laying waste to enemy troops with dual-wielded heavy weapons and powerful armor was probably my most exhilarating experience in PlanetSide 2, and right from the start I felt like a badass instead of a bumbling fool. It might take a long time to afford new weapons or get meaningful upgrades like flying vehicles and the Nanite-consuming Max class, especially if you don’t pay to speed up your progression, but getting there is a good time. While there are definitely prettier shooters on the PS4, PlanetSide 2 manages to keep a steady 30 FPS frame rate during even the most hectic of battles, with the only stuttering movement caused by lag. I did run into a few glitches during the early days after launch; sometimes I'd spawn on uneven terrain or at the enemy's spawn point and immediately die in both instances, and on three occasions I’ve had the game crash to the PlayStation 4's main menu. However, for the dozen-plus hours I've spent in PlanetSide 2 so far, those incidents were spaced out enough that my experience was relatively stable for a new game launch during the first week. It’s always darkest before the dawn, and my experience learning to fight in PlanetSide 2’s huge battles was the price I paid for the fun that comes later. Expect vagueness, under-explanation, and frustration at the start, but perseverance is rewarded with sci-fi warfare on a scale you'll see in few other shooters. For a cost of zero dollars and zero cents, it’s a sight shooter fans should see for themselves."
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	 At its core, Mad Max is a game about the death of hope. It’s about learning to find something to cling to in a pointless existence of murder and regret, and then watching it turn to ash in your hands. But that kernel of anguish is buried deep down in an adventure that demands to be explored through sheepish smiles and wide-eyed amazement as each combustive, sickening, and awesome moment of Max’s warpath consumes every foot of wasteland. But for Max, the reluctant hero, the wasteland is something to escape. He’s lost his car and nearly his life at the hands of Scabrous Scrotus, the resident Warlord of the refinery-city Gas Town. Fortunately, the deformed, sun-soaked blackfinger, Chumbucket, sees Max as the ordained prophet of his car-based religion, sent from the Angel of Combustion to help build and drive the Magnum Opus - the greatest vehicle the wasteland will ever know.    For all this engaging premise, most of the traditional storytelling disappears until the near-end, when it ultimately, surprisingly succeeds. By the closing credits, I had a genuine reaction to Avalanche’s tale of Max, but I wish more of it had been peppered throughout my 30-40 hours of play time. Yet in the space between the premise and climax, Max is about your progression and domination of a world full of striking, ugly beauty, and incredible atmosphere. Nearly everything and everyone you’ll meet fits the purpose and lore of the wasteland; it’s alive with personality and indifference. And it may be the true star of Mad Max, despite the unsteady frame rate, texture popping, and physics quirkiness. If not the wasteland, then the excellent layers of systems that drive Mad Max’s gameplay are the real draw. Its progression mechanisms urge you to complete an exhaustive list of challenges to increase your Legend, which you cash in with Griffa – a sort of wasteland therapist – to increase base attributes. But you’ll also collect Scrap – the wasteland’s currency – to upgrade individual pieces of armor, weapons, tools, combat moves, and even Max’s look. And that’s all just Max. The same attention is offered to the Magnum Opus - where you’ll literally build the car from scrap and purchase things like nitro boosters, a harpoon, explosive javelins, spikes, armor, tires, and even side-mounted flame cannons. You are always earning something that directly changes your experience, and it’s incredibly rewarding. And fortunately, for us, the players who visit this violent husk of a world, leaving our treadmarks on its scorched earth and igniting all we touch, there are many, many things to do. In the lengthy process of wrestling control of the wasteland from its brutal, established warlords, you’ll destroy their refineries, kill their Top Dogs, burn their fuel depots, and topple their gruesome intimidation totems. All of these activities are great, and engaging in their own right, but they begin to suffer from diminishing returns as their rinse/repeat nature sinks in down the stretch.    But Mad Max’s combat is the great promise at each of these destinations. Both behind the wheel and on foot, there’s an exciting flourish to the familiar feel that comes with murdering the roaming war parties of the Roadkill, Buzzard, and Scrotus’ War Boy factions. Melee combat is an instantly recognizable, absolutely brutal dance of attacks and timed-counters, though some added depth can be found in the addition of weapons, executions, chain attacks, and Fury Mode – Max’s bloodlust that turns him into a one-man wrecking crew. Vehicle combat is a high-speed gnashing of metal and the best part of Mad Max’s overflowing action. Ramming and sideswiping, using your harpoon to pull armor, wheels, and even drivers from enemy vehicles, or detonating exposed fuel drums with your gun blast - there’s simply no shortage of creative ways to annihilate on the road. And that’s necessary, as random patrols strike quickly, and the hulking convoys of wasteland machines that snake through dirt roads are challenging, but well worth the effort to take down. Even after the credits rolled, there was so much left for me to see and discover. Collecting dozens of other wasteland vehicles, building supercar variants of the Magnum Opus, competing in unique death run races, competing online against other players’ vehicles, and even collecting historical artifacts from the world before, it all reinforces the fact Mad Max is a sandbox crafted with the tone of the material in mind. And its gorgeous, striking, and often bitter visual moods can be captured in a cinematic mode, that let’s you pull the camera through time and space to snap the perfect picture or video of the destruction on screen. Despite so much time spent in the dirty, blood-stained boots of Mad Max, I know I’m nowhere near done in The Great White. Mad Max is a juxtaposition of exciting, thrilling fun set in a world of disgusting, primal depravity – like a singing telegram informing you of a death in the family, or an ice-cream cake with your terminal test results written in frosting. It’s a conflicting place of despair, a personal playground of explosive action and compulsive, unending progression that I can’t wait to get back to, and one hell of a ride.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	 I’ll give Magicka 2 this: it completely commits to its imaginative spellcasting system, sometimes to its hilarious benefit, and sometimes to its frustrating detriment. There were moments when I felt like a true sorcery savant, furiously tapping out the perfect elemental combinations in the nick of time; at others, my efforts felt artificially thwarted by cheap, unavoidable deaths, especially when playing solo. Magicka 2 can be an unreasonably cruel mistress, but its charming world and sophisticated mechanics kept me coming back, particularly when I brought a friend or two along for some chaotic co-op.  By entering combinations of 10 magical elements one button at a time, Magicka 2 lets you experiment to discover a crazy number of different spells – and amazingly, all of them wind up being useful at one point or another. There’s a clear logic to how the spellweaving works: fire and water make steam, water and cold become ice, and so forth. Once I got the many rules down, I almost immediately went mad with power. Need a circular wall of stone that protects and heals you? Go for it. Need a spell that arcs to multiple targets like lightning, but burns like fire? Create it. For as much power as Magicka 2 gives you, it’s well-matched by encounters that require you to wield that power intelligently. For example, you might get drenched walking through a shallow creek. Suddenly, casting lightning spells becomes a painful and ineffective mistake. I handled it by heading back to dry land and casting a weak fire spell on myself to dry off, followed by a combination of three water elements and a barrier to become H2O immune. This allowed me to stand in the middle of the water and happily pump my sword up with as much lightning as I pleased while my enemies charged towards me all soggy, ready to take tons of bonus damage from my melee attacks. Through its relatively short six to eight hours, Magicka 2’s campaign had me thinking and chuckling in equal measures, with a constant drip of sly pop-culture references to shows like Archer and Game of Thrones peppered throughout the ever-more-devious combat scenarios. The thing is, situations like the one I just described require you to remember all those combinations, and to enter around 10 to 15 button commands in a matter of seconds on the fly. It’s a complexity that reminds me of a fighting game, which is great, except that unlike a fighting game there aren’t any proper “low execution” options to lean on when you’re under pressure, so even simple situations can be mechanically demanding depending on how you want to approach them. There are hotkeys for certain powerful spells, but those are more long-cooldown heavy hitters than general use tools. Magicka 2 is demanding, to a far greater degree than its playful, colorful countenance would seem to imply. If you manage to get it all to click though, there’s a unique sense of mastery to reward your hard work. Unfortunately, even once you feel like you’ve mastered the art of sorcery, there are several insane difficulty spikes that, if you’re playing alone, might make you feel like you never had a chance. Some enemy attacks will arbitrarily knock you clean from one end of the screen down a bottomless pit on the other, and others will simply insta-gib you if you haven’t prepared the appropriate defensive spell in advance. You’ll get hit with multi-element combinations of crowd-control spells, freezing, slowing, or juggling you, and/or blocking your escape path, leading to unavoidable deaths as you scramble to cast the appropriate spells to counter them all. The worst was when I’d get knocked off-screen, causing the camera to glitch out. I’d watch in maddening frustration as enemies walked off screen to kill me while my character sat unresponsive in the ether past the edge of my television, waiting to die. In moments like this, Magicka 2 feels actively hostile towards solo players. However, the second a friend would jump in to help, all the frustration melted away. You can play up to four-player co-op, and I highly recommend that you do, because allies can continuously revive one another. That more forgiving balance of life and death often turns freak accidents into side-splitting comedy instead of progress-robbing disasters. Friendly fire is in full effect, so there are lots of opportunities for things to go delightfully wrong, and about as many chances to cooperate in interesting ways – like breaking the Ghostbusters’ rule and crossing streams of opposing elements to create explosive, area-clearing vortexes. Having partners in crime also rounds off the mechanical demands. Since you’re no longer the sole damage dealer, you have more time to think and more opportunities to play more of a support role, should that be your thing.  To that end, there’s a surprising number of unlockable robes, staves, and melee weapons you can don to specialize your little wizard. Magicka 2 doesn’t bring full-on RPG-level gearing options or anything, but choosing the right tools for your style can make quite the difference. And hey, who doesn’t want to wield stick with a jester’s head in one hand and a chainsaw in the other? You can even unlock a bevy of modifiers to activate in any combination you’d like to change up your experience. Eliminating specific elements or exaggerating player death animations makes playing back through specific levels with friends a blast. Though it momentarily made me want to commit crimes against my controller at certain points when playing alone, Magicka 2’s one-of-a-kind magic system made it difficult to stay mad for very long. Add in the zany, unpredictable nature of co-op and the many ways in which you can alter the experience, and Magicka 2 can provide long lasting, if somewhat demanding and occasionally frustrating good times.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	 Last year I called Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster for PlayStation 3 and Vita a great compilation that was worth fans’ time, and gave it a score of 9.3. Here’s what I said then: “Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is outstanding. With enhanced art and music, tons of extra in-game content, cross-save compatibility, and bundling two huge games for the price of one, it’s a lot of bang for your buck.”   There didn’t seem to be much room for improvement, but an extra coat of paint convinced me that the PS4 Remaster is the best way to (re)experience the world of Spira. The first thing I noticed was the visual upgrade to NPCs and enemies. Blocky PlayStation 2-era textures still present in the PS3/Vita Remaster have been rounded out on the PS4 version, bringing them more in line with the heroes’ smooth contours. The next thing I noticed is the additional color and detail added to all of the character models, including the main characters: I could see the tiniest swirls on Wakka’s vibrantly blue headband in FFX, and I dug how bright Yuna's earring tassel is in FFX-2. Buildings and fauna received touch-ups as well. Far-off structures are more distinct, making them a part of the world instead of fuzzy background decoration. And thanks to improved light and shadow effects, water and clouds look more visceral, while previously opaque objects in dark rooms like facial features are easier to see.   Sharper detail and better lighting meant I noticed things that I hadn’t paid attention to before. In Eternal Calm, I saw Yuna’s fingers twitch anxiously as an old man droned on about his problems. In FFX’s Zanarkand, I saw the hair on an NPC sway back and forth as she bounced on her toes. And I noticed colorful pennants lining Luca’s stadium after Yuna gave a rousing rock concert in FF X-2. Gameplay-wise, not a whole lot has changed, and neither have the annoyingly unskippable minutes-long cutscenes. You can change the music in FFX from the remastered version to the classic soundtrack, which is a nice touch for people like me who prefer the original score. The PS4 Remaster also allows you to transfer your PS3/Vita save to the PS4, in case you want to continue playing from wherever you left off. (I like the idea, though if you already bought one of the previous versions, it seems a bit excessive to buy it again). Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster is already great way to play these classic RPGs on the PS3 and Vita, and the even prettier PlayStation 4 version comes with the visual improvements you’d expect for the new-generation platform.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/13/titan-souls-review	 With no more than a bow and a single arrow, Titan Souls’ nameless child protagonist is a pure symbol of skill over style. He’s a small, barefoot, and seemingly insignificant David in the 16-bit shadows cast by the many hulking Golaiths that tower over him. And fittingly, just like the two-dimensional sprite of this boy, Titan Souls is itself an unassuming and short expression of mechanical excellence. Though the sparse fiction of its fantasy world takes a backseat to the exacting top-down arcade-style boss battles, felling the gargantuan creatures with feats of precision is an intense gauntlet where one mistake means instant death. Titan Souls’ great challenge is mastering these arenas and besting your own past performances in a game of escalating difficulty – and it’s a greatly rewarding experience.  The spartan nature of Titan Souls is best summed up by the way it demands that you make every shot count. You have a bow and the ability to fire one single arrow – the longer you draw the bow, the further and faster the arrow travels – but the farther you shoot it, the tougher it is to retrieve and reuse. You can walk, run, or roll to go pick it up, or use your Force-like will to pull it back to you (at the cost of planting your feet). That’s it. This is your entire toolkit when tackling creatures that spit fire, swing boulder-sized maces, and conjure all sorts of lethal magical forces. And though scant in ways to interact with the world, what’s here is snappy and fluid. I always felt as nimble and precise as the boy on screen appears, which is necessary when you’re running for your fragile life while waiting for that golden window to appear. The simplicity is refreshing, as it scoops out the fat that so many games layer on with so many variables and strategies. Here, there is only one strategy: Learn where to fire your arrow and practice until you hit your mark. Each clash with the varied range of titans is excellently engaging, forcing you to learn their movement patterns, attacks, environments, and weak spots where a well-placed arrow undoes their imposing stature. And as if these hulks were goading you into their grasp, the glowing chinks in their armor are almost always plainly visible, yet painstaking to reach in the ensuing maelstrom of attacks that will snuff you out on contact. Victory is always just an arrow away. It’s fortunate that these engagements are so creative and meticulously constructed, because the experience is generally devoid of anything else. The world proper is very much a hub that non-linearly connects the usual suspects of fantasy environments: the lava region, the snow area, the forest section, and their appropriately themed encounters. However, there are no minions or monsters to slay en route to a boss fight, so while the 16-bit-style art is endearing, there’s little to really see or discover beyond the caves, paths, and stairways that lead toward your next bout with a titan. That same scarcity applies to the very loose story that ties it all together. It’s told through a few ambiguous cutscenes, cryptic murals etched into stone, and a single encounter that offers some narrative pseudo-explanation. Titan Souls is less a world in which one can get lost and more an obstacle course of mechanically challenging boss battles, though the superbly soothing acoustic strings that create its soundtrack make the repeated trek between fights much more enjoyable.  But as so much of Titan Souls is trial and error, and death comes so quickly and repeatedly, developer Acid Nerve has wisely scattered checkpoints throughout the smaller environments, minimizing what could otherwise be an immensely tedious journey back to an encounter. I found one or two battles to still be a noticeable shade too far from their respective checkpoints – a 10 to 15-second run – but the majority of the fights are helpfully just a few seconds away after death, which I absolutely appreciated when a titan ostensibly had my number. Yet through perseverance and improvement, I conquered all of Titan Souls’ nearly two dozen titular beings in approximately four hours. And with all said and done, I admit to wishing there were more of these creative engagements to test myself against – that’s less a slight toward Titan Souls and more a symptom of the great satisfaction to be enjoyed from each victory. It doesn’t end that quickly, though; this is a game that’s meant to be replayed, and replayed again, though due to the lack of randomization, the means by which it refreshes itself may only intrigue the most dedicated players. Once completed, you restart the same crucible to beat your tracked clear time with a smaller number of deaths, doing it faster and more efficiently each time. Modifiers like Hard Mode – which recycles each fight’s formula but ramps up the speed and difficulty – along with the aptly named No Rolls mode, and Iron Mode where a single death restarts the game, slightly extend the experience, but only for those who want to conquer their own imperfect reflexes as much as the titans.   PlayStation 4 Version The current-gen console version of Titan Souls is as great as the PC version in every technical way. Additionally, the fact that Titan Souls almost requires controller support means that the PS4 version automatically comes with the intended control peripheral. However, if you're a bigger fan of a non-Sony, third-party controller then PC is a totally comparable experience. The addition of the Share button on PS4 is actually incredibly useful for Titan Souls. As titans will occasionally crumple in mere seconds thanks to a one-in-a-million shot, now you can save those moments forever. And you should, because it's quite possible they'll never happen again.   PS Vita Of the current three versions of Titan Souls available, the PlayStation Vita is my least favorite. Though technically fine and on par with the console and PC offerings (outside of some noticeably small text on the main menu), the smaller scale is certainly noticeable. While it may not be an issue for every game, a game like Titan Souls, ostensibly about firing arrows at exact angles to hit extremely small targets, suffers under the reduction in size. I found the precision of combat to take a hit, but otherwise it's an equally fine and functional portable alternative in every other way. Titan Souls’ sparse world and lore is merely the delivery device for its creative fights that hinge on your perception and skillful mastery of its simple, yet fluid and responsive controls. Though the experience is short, it’s potent, as weathering every titan’s impossibly lethal storm and finding that one true strike is an excellent and intoxicating retelling of David versus Goliath each time. And should you survive the punishing menagerie of monsters, having mastered each bout, Titan Souls raises the stakes and the difficulty, daring you to shoot to kill and do it better.
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/mlb-15-the-show-review	 Continuing Sony’s 10-year tradition, MLB 15: The Show remains an excellent recreation of The Great American Pastime... but it’s a very safe one. There aren’t any groundbreaking new features that distinguish it from last year’s also-impressive MLB 14: The Show, but the minor adjustments to its batting and modes are welcomed. Relying heavily on its nearly perfected formula of gorgeous scenery, strong gameplay mechanics, and rewarding game modes, it’s fundamentally strong, but there’s not much by way of novelty to excite a returning fan like myself.  Focusing in on those improvements, the first is an incremental graphics upgrade. As great as last year’s MLB 14 looks on the PlayStation 4, MLB 15: The Show looks even better. Adding a real-time seasonal sun makes a big difference, thanks to striking shadows in each beautifully crafted ballpark that realistically shift throughout the course of a game. MLB 15 has also enhanced its exceptionally detailed player models by adding more skin tone variations that are much more true to life. And the crowds feel alive. Fans hold up clever signs, dance when something great happens, and boo when something bad happens. There’s so much variety that I had a hard time spotting the same models or animations twice when the camera cut to the crowd: families, friends, couples and season-ticket holders are all distinct. It’s astounding. As long as you don’t look too hard at what’s behind the bleachers, the environments are completely believable, and can be remarkably immersive. On the field, the biggest addition this year is directional hitting. Being accustomed to lining up my bat with the ball, this more intuitive approach to hitting actually took me a while to understand. Now, aiming where I want my ball to go feels more logical. Meanwhile, we’ve still got the solid pitching options available, including my personal favorite: pulse pitching. It’s a happy balance that’s nuanced and challenging, but not overwhelmingly complex. On defense, players respond realistically wherever the ball lands, and controlling their fielding is smooth and easy. The entire list of game modes from last year are back and slightly better than ever. First of all, I’m happy to report that the online modes The Show are vastly improved compared to last year, when the lag made MLB 14 unplayable at times. I haven’t experienced a single lag-related hiccup so far this year, but I have seen the occasional glitch.  I have to point out, though, that Sony’s announcement that the online modes for MLB 14 will be turned off in June [update: in response to feedback, Sony has extended the life of MLB 14 indefinitely] has shaken confidence that MLB 15’s online modes will be around for long. For single-player modes, the new year-to-year save feature allows you to continue your progress from MLB 14: The Show, which is great, because I wasn’t ready to say goodbye to my team. (I spent way more time than I’m willing to publicly admit making franchises full of created players with the names and likeness of my friends.)  The flagship Road to The Show mode has gone mostly unchanged. As before, you start the career of a MLB hopeful, level him up by performing well on the field, and work your way up to the big leagues. It’s quick, addicting, and scratched my RPG itch… again. The only notable change to this mode is the addition of licensed equipment – for example, you can earn universal card drops that reward you with equipment like Rawlings gloves, Louisville Slugger bats, and Nike shoes. Their presence adds to the authenticity of the branding-heavy real-world MLB broadcasts, and also gives you a little stat boost. Meanwhile, Franchise mode adds GM contracts and ownership expectations, which can lead to job offers from other clubs if you do well... or can get you fired if you don’t. That fear of failure made me plan more carefully and think about every decision I made, as opposed to just trying everything to see what would work. Also, the new Inside the Show radio show does an impressive job with contextualized updates from your team and from around your own personal league.  The virtual card-collecting fantasy baseball mode, Diamond Dynasty, has been simplified for MLB 15. It’s now much more manageable with no contracts to worry about, and is fun even without buying into its microtransactions. You don’t even have to play Diamond Dynasty to collect cards anymore, which allowed me to play other modes without feeling like I was missing out on opportunities to progress my team. The best addition to Diamond Dynasty, however, has to be the custom-made utility player that can play every position, including pitcher. When you first create him, he’s a very average player, but feeding him unwanted cards from your stash improves his skills. Finding the balance between using my best cards to field a competitive team, saving Giants cards to eventually unlock Will Clark, or feeding them to my created player is rewarding, and will keep me coming back for more. MLB 15: The Show is an excellent and complete package with lots of different ways to experience baseball in all its glory. But it’s a very familiar complete package. Other than functional online play, there’s nothing revolutionary about this year’s version. It does get to legitimately say that it looks and plays better than any other baseball game you can buy right now, but only slightly.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	 Axiom Verge takes the adage “imitation is the sincerest form of flattery” and has it emblazoned across every moment of its 10-hour campaign. This 2D sidescroller pulls in most of the things that made Metroid such a classic experience: great weapons, interesting abilities, and a fantastic sense of progression. But where Nintendo’s classic presents a memorable setting with an evocative atmosphere, Axiom Verge’s world failed to leave a lasting impression on me.   The sense of character progression throughout Axiom Verge delivers a lot of satisfaction. You’re constantly stumbling upon new powers and abilities that allow you to go back and open up dead ends you passed long ago. Gaining the ability to phase through thin walls five hours in, and then using it to grab a power-up that you saw near the beginning of the game gives a nice feeling of accomplishment for those who pay careful attention to their surroundings at all times. Likewise, seeing your hero grow from a relatively helpless guy stranded on a strange planet, to a demigod with an arsenal that’d make Master Chief jealous is a smoothly rewarding process. The dozen-or-so guns you get all feel very different, and have specific uses. The glitch gun is handy for transforming deadly enemies into peaceful platforms, while ice beams help to slow down particularly chaotic enemies. My favorite tool in Axiom Verge’s arsenal is a small spider drone which you can deploy and fully control to scout out sticky situations while your main character hangs back in safety. You’ll need to become familiar with all of your weapons and tools, because Axiom Verge features some awesome, challenging boss encounters. Learning their patterns and weaknesses, and ultimately slaying one of the massive beasts is a good old-fashioned rush. Controls are responsive, and the sensation of movement and combat feel great. Sure, there were a few that had me dying over and over again until I really memorized their patterns, but this was never too much of a burden thanks to Axiom Verge’s quick load times and ample checkpoints While the combat feels great, Axiom Verge’s sense of exploration is a letdown. The map unfolds as a hodgepodge of identical squares that never really give you any indication of what you’ve stumbled across. While I appreciate a game that doesn’t hold my hand, without a clear objective I found myself getting lost far too often, especially after taking a break and coming back to the game. And without a method of fast-travel, I spent far too much time wandering back and forth across vast stretches of the map in an attempt to figure out just what the hell I should be doing.  One place Axiom Verge fails to learn from the classics is in its world design. Where Super Metroid is littered with memorable scenery and zones that feel completely different, yet spatially connected to one another, Axiom Verge’s locales never really stuck with me. Nothing about the world really felt lived in, or had any memorable personality. Metroid’s world made sense -- whether it was a crashed ship to explore near the planet’s surface, or a zone near the planet’s core that’s filled with molten lava. Axiom’s world just feels arbitrary. That goes for the story, too. Where Metroid succeeds by delivering its plot purely through environmental storytelling and atmosphere, Axiom Verge often grinds the action to a halt and delivers an exposition dump onto you. The story certainly isn’t bad, but I never felt attached to the characters or their problems, so pulling me out of the action ultimately turned into a chore. Despite occasional moments of feeling slightly uncomfortable by just how much Axiom Verge feels like Metroid, I still felt compelled to see this journey to the end. The weapons feel great, the character progression is rewarding, and bringing down a massive boss is awesome. While I wish it balanced its lack of mission explanations with its overabundance of exposition, I still really enjoyed my time in its strange, yet familiar world
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	 There’s incredible power to Bloodborne. It’s not just an amazing dance of dodges and swipes through encounters that often push the limits of reflexes and endurance, it’s a thought-provoking experience that’s wormed its way into my mind and melted my resolve. But through perseverance, patient growth, and determined skill, it’s proved itself an unconventional adventure that ultimately gives much more than it takes – which at times can be a staggering cost. By the end, the only frustrations that don’t turn to triumphs are the technical ones. After more than 60 hours of grappling with its terrors, monsters, and the environment itself, I’m left dumbfounded by Bloodborne’s capability to draw powerful emotions from me, and make me earn the successes that I’ll remember for years to come. Its unconventional approach to action-RPG gameplay walks a fine line between utter elation and despair as it takes us on an awe-inspiring journey through the highest peaks of satisfaction and the deepest, blackest pits of exhausted desperation. Developer From Software chooses to tell us little about how to survive its gauntlet, and yet expects feats of intelligence and perseverance in the face of its brutal, unrelenting difficulty. That balance is slightly upset by painfully long loading screens upon death or travel to different zones, but the highs of taking down one of the many intimidating bosses make up for those chunks of downtime. Bloodborne’s semi-open world structure and hard-earned progression draw heavily from the Dark Souls and Demon's Souls games that made From famous, though the aggressive new pace of combat is all its own. These diving, rolling melee battles with an awesome arsenal of transforming melee weapons and tactical sidearms chiseled away my calluses and made me form new ones, even as a hardened Dark Souls veteran. Switching weapons between their light and heavy modes on the fly to string together combo-like attack chains in an engaging way injects a newfound versatility, even if it’s a less calculating kind of battle than we see in From’s earlier games. That doesn’t make it any easier, though. Being overwhelmed by enemies is commonplace, but thanks to your ability to leech back lost health with quick counterattacks and to stun opponents with secondary weapons, I found it’s possible to sustain a constant onslaught when I’d built up enough skill. And these tools are absolutely needed, as Bloodborne’s horrifying beasts span an imaginative range, from pedestrian insane village folk to cosmic horrors and patchwork fiends. Creature design strikes terror in many ways – enormous axe-swinging skeletons, peculiar semi-transparent childlike creatures, and subtle creepiness, like a coven of wailing, cleaver wielding hags – but each entity is well-crafted and triumphantly threatening. That’s best exemplified by the bosses, which have the power to mystify, terrify, and infuriate. I ultimately found many of those big fights much simpler than getting past the trial-and-error battles with dozens of smaller enemies I fought to reach them, but the satisfaction in each and every victory was huge. The progression that follows those hard-fought wins is a carefully doled-out treat in Bloodborne. For one thing, the glowing pale purple lamps that serve as its version of checkpoints are scarce. Surviving long enough to reach the next point is rarely an option you can count on, but delving out of your comfort zone to find a secret shortcut back to safety brings a wave of comfort. Unfortunately, the inability to warp between these lamps without a layover back to the Hunter’s Dream (your ethereal-feeling home base) is a needless annoyance that exacerbates the issue with the extended load times. After arriving at a destination, nearly every careful, blood-soaked step through the consistently stunning environments reveals something new about Bloodborne’s vague and cryptic lore. Whispers and clues are everywhere, begging to be interpreted. Despite a frame rate that all too often buckles under the strain of loading new areas or heavy action, the atmosphere retains its full effect. There’s a sense that this strange and dark place is alive. You could find a subtext of criticisms on real-world concepts like faith and worship in the understated dialogue, but taking each outrageously odd story point at face value is the more enjoyable path.  Yet your personal story will be created on your own terms, as you explore the spiderweb of paths and secrets that crisscross Bloodborne’s potent world. Everything is packed with hidden meaning, and spending time speaking with the forgotten citizens of the eerily rotting city of Yharnam yields new ways to interact with the world. At one point, I spoke with a victim of these dark circumstances who gifted me a family heirloom that seemed inconsequential at the time; it wasn’t until I took the time to read its description that it suddenly became a vital tool in a battle to come. Rewards in Bloodborne come with careful examination and curious effort, and I wouldn’t have it any other way. There’s so much to do and see and try here that I obsessed over finding every secret, which greatly extends Bloodborne’s already lengthy playtime – though that number can easily be extended in a New Game Plus, or the refreshing procedurally generated Chalice Dungeons. These areas aren’t just more of the same – they’re loaded with items that can be carried back into the main story, exclusive weapons and bosses, and the player-versus-environment replayability that the Souls series was always missing.  And though Bloodborne is mostly an isolating and solitary experience, subtle cooperative elements enhance that in fascinating ways. Spotting (non-interactive) ghostly shades of other players passing through your area, reading warnings and tips left by people who have come before, and studying reenactments of player deaths by activating prompts on the ground all serve as cautionary tales – immensely helpful in avoiding surprises that would otherwise leap out and kill you. Though these features are all mostly identical to their earlier iterations in Dark Souls, some things have improved. The best addition to the messaging system is the inclusion of emotes that spring to life like a hologram when someone reads the message. On the lowest rung of Old Yharnam, in a grimey alleyway corner, I used the available pick-and-choose word selection to lay down the message: “item waits ahead, but beware ambush,” then aimed and added the ‘point’ emote for a visual indicator to point to where a killer waited in the shadows. According to the rating system, it’s been very helpful to others, and that’s a great feeling. I saved lives.  As far as cooperative multiplayer, Bloodborne is every bit as obtuse as Dark Souls ever was. It allows you to call for help from another player when you need it most, such as a boss fight that feels like a brick wall or a group of enemies you don’t feel confident in taking on alone, by ringing a Beckoning Bell; any players ringing a response bell in the area will warp into your world. The catch (since there’s always a catch in Bloodborne) is that at the same time, you open yourself up to invasion from hostile players that are actively seeking to hunt and kill other hunters. In a rare move of compassion, this time around From has wisely included a password-protected game feature so that you and a friend can connect deliberately, removing some of the ambiguity of anonymous cooperation. Bloodborne is an amazing, exacting, and exhausting pilgrimage through a gorgeous land that imposes the feeling of approaching the bottom of a descent into madness. Though extended load times and minor frame-rate hitches have an effect on the pacing, it’s otherwise an intensely challenging and rewarding game. There’s an incredible power to unlocking its mysteries, and in succeeding, despite its demand for a pound of your flesh.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	 Helldivers is the rare game that knows exactly what it wants to do, and does it with complete confidence and authority. So much more than just another twin-stick shooter, it presents us with incredibly varied mission sandboxes and tactical options, then respects our intelligence enough to let us figure it all out on our own or with three friends. The result is some of the most white-knuckle co-op action I’ve ever experienced.  From the opening cinematic, Helldivers wears its Starship Troopers influences on its sleeve. The tongue-in-cheek, over-the-top way in which it sets up the ongoing war between the aliens and our homeworld, Super Earth, is a clear nod to director Paul Verhoeven’s film, and it lends the action a delicious sense of both humor and danger. It’s mostly superficial in that the themes of radical Nationalism are never really explored, but the jingoistic one-liners your space marine spouts out are chuckle-worthy all the same, effectively drawing me into Helldivers’ persistent online war despite knowing my people probably started it for all the wrong reasons. This questionable galactic war is fought on three fronts against the tech-heavy Illuminate, the gun-toting Cyborgs, and the Tyranid-esque bugs known simply as…bugs. Each faction brings a diverse set of units to bear, requiring you to either adapt your tactics, or die a horrible death. Cyborgs tote a lot of small caliber firearms, making heavy body armor a great choice to shrug off volleys that might have otherwise put you on the ground. Don't forget to bring something to punch through armor too, or you'll spend the better part of your mission running from mixed groups of tanks and hulking mechanized super-soldiers. On the other end of the spectrum, failing to pack some extra ammo for your shotgun against the bugs is usually a fatal mistake, since they love to get up close and personal. Every online match of Helldivers feeds into this three-pronged war, with each front’s greatest contributors being cleverly immortalized with an ever-present leaderboard. As you and your fellow heroes retake planets by waging successful missions, the war will eventually spill over to the alien homeworld, or to your own if not enough people are fighting the good fight. Either situation leads to a timed special event where all players are called on to make one final push, or a desperate last stand. It's a smart system that gives each mission a greater sense of purpose, not to mention an urgency to log on every day to do your part.  The real magic though, happens when you start unlocking more of Helldivers’ large arsenal of perks, weapons, upgrades, and equipment calldowns called stratagems. After over 25 hours, I still haven’t gotten everything, and from disposable anti-tank weapons, to gun-covered troop-carriers, every piece of gear feels meaningful, since each ends up being particularly useful for certain objectives or against particular foes. Capture or defend objectives call for sentry turrets, where snow-covered maps might tempt you to bring an exo-suit or a jump-pack to make traversal easier. You can only bring so much though, and adapting your loadout based on what your objectives are and what your teammates are bringing is where Helldivers exhibits much of its depth. No matter what you bring to the fight though, Helldivers’ meaty sound effects convey the action convincingly, despite its so-so visuals. Whether you’re squeezing the last few rounds out of a heavy machine gun, or obliterating a screen full of enemies with a thundering artillery strike, everything sounds powerful and threatening.  Many of these delightful bits of kit are designed to facilitate cooperative play. The recoilless rifle, for instance, comes with a separate supply pack with extra ammo. You could carry it yourself, but the reload time between shots will make it pretty impractical to use. Have a buddy carry the supply pack though, and they can walk up to you and toss in another shell in the blink of an eye. Touches like this make a full party of four feel like a cohesive fighting unit where every member is more powerful than they would be alone. Helldivers’ drop-in co-op makes forming a party easy from the couch, online, or a mix of both, which is fortunate, because while going solo can be rewarding in its own right, you can only get so far on your own. The fact that virtually everything is deadly, be it friend or foe, makes every mission tense. Drop pods bringing a fresh supply of ammo might unceremoniously turn a teammate to goo, or a poorly placed airstrike might do more harm than good. There's just so much nitty gritty to get into, from going prone to let teammates safely fire past you, to using 90-degree angle shots to maximize armor penetration against enemy vehicles, and the cost of learning is almost always paid in blood - be it yours or a teammate's. But when you and your team fire on all cylinders to turn back the intense waves of enemies coming your way long enough to dramatically hop in a dropship and make a narrow escape, the sense of accomplishment is positively euphoric. It isn’t the prettiest game you can play on PS4, PS3 or Vita, but Helldivers is one of the most exhilarating, and you’ll get all three versions for the price of one. It pits you against seemingly impossible odds, arms you with a powerful, diverse toolset, and empowers you and a group of people to put the pieces together - and they all fit together beautifully.

Jon Ryan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review	 The first time I encountered the titular beast of Far Cry 4’s Valley of the Yetis DLC, I was unarmed, alone and trapped in a cave with the 10-foot-tall monster. As it tracked my scent and inched closer, I felt my heart rate rise with every step I took towards my escape – and when I’d finally made it to safety I breathed deep a sigh of relief. Just like Far Cry 4 before it, this expansion did an excellent job of immersing me in its new setting, and manages to be a raucous good time in the process. However, while Valley of the Yetis presents some interesting changes and its gameplay fundamentals are still fun, when the short campaign is over there’s not much left to do.  While basics of Far Cry’s first-person exploration remain unchanged, there are a few mainstays that have been done away with here. The most notable omission in this new location is the need to liberate any outposts. Instead, it places you (as Ajay Gale) in a single relay station that you must defend from nightly attacks. Forgoing the organic day-night cycle, assaults are triggered by advancing time. When the sun goes down, waves of soldiers - and eventually yetis - begin their onslaught, and the balance of fortification and frantic action feels just right. The ability to add defenses like machine gun nests or minefields – available either by completing side missions or by purchasing them for in-game cash – gave it an enjoyable tower-defense sensibility that meshes well with the horde-repelling action. This new defensive emphasis makes sense, given the relatively smaller scale of Valley of the Yetis. The snow-covered valley map is beautifully designed, and creates the impression that it’s much larger than it is. Sparse branches and brown leaves cover trees along the edges of snowy fields and iced-over rivers, while packs of wolves hunt high in the foothills and caves of the icy Himalayas. This is one of the best environments seen in a Far Cry game yet, to the point where I’m somewhat upset there weren’t more areas like this in Far Cry 4. Of course, wolves are hardly the most dangerous creature in this icy playground. As the title implies, mythical beasts roam these hills - and they are both fun and frightening opponents in combat. Since they’re essentially 10-foot gorillas, the yetis are incredibly strong – usually one to two hits and you’re dead – but they’re also alarmingly fast. I recall the first time I stumbled across the elusive beast in the open world; I had (foolishly) attempted to bring it down with a bow, and it gave chase. Assuming I’d be safe, I hopped onto my snowmobile and sped off… only to look behind me and see that the monster was gaining on me. Thankfully, it was distracted by a passing jeep full of human enemies and decided to focus on de-socketing some of their limbs instead of mine.  It was organic moments like these that made me forgive the campaign's lackluster story. The core conceit of “Expedition Finds Monsters, Goes Insane” is good, but that was never the focus of the plot. Instead, we’re forced to listen to Ajay argue with the antagonist via radio, and any backstory I gleaned was from picking up various notes and journals around the world – many of which I missed or didn’t feel compelled to collect at all. It wasn’t until the final missions that I found myself even somewhat invested in my fight against the cult-like Disciples of Yalung, and even then that interest dissipated when I blasted my way through to the less-than-satisfying ending. It’s a shame, too, because while the campaign missions themselves are fun and the nightly defenses and upgrade quests are a cool addition, there’s not much else to do in the Valley aside from collect weapons and animal skins. You might say to yourself, “Why should I bother picking up weapons? I’ve already unlocked all the signatures!” While in the main game you’d be correct, in Valley Ajay is reset to zero – you’ll need to re-acquire all of his weapons, re-craft all of his bags, and re-earn all of his skills and abilities. Thankfully, this is made easier by the fact that XP is far easier to earn, and unlocking items and weapons are now done by finding chests and caches on the map instead of liberating bell towers. I understand that forcing us to re-spec our skills and loadouts may add a sense of progression and a couple of hours of playtime, but it begs the question: If you’re going to make it so easy to re-earn everything I’d previously unlocked, why bother making me repeat myself at all? While Valley of the Yetis fails to provide a truly engaging story or a convincing reason why we should go through the hassle of unlocking our weapons and skills for a second time, its new defensive missions and monsters add some depth to the already excellent core gameplay of Far Cry 4. Despite not having much to do outside of the campaign new defense missions, exploring the Valley of the Yetis is good fun - both as the hunter and as the hunted.
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/03/olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood-review	 Much like skateboarding itself, the original OllOlli proved that there’s plenty of room for individual expression within the skateboarding genre. It hit the Vita with a fresh perspective, demonstrating just how great technical street skating could be in 2D. OlliOlli 2 blows that first effort out of the water on every level. This is developer Roll7’s Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 2. Like that landmark game, OlliOlli 2 introduces the manual, bringing a whole new dimension to the gameplay. It works in much the same way, letting you land in a manual out of any trick and thus keep your combo going, opening up the possibility of beating each level in a single monster trick. Bluntslides are cool, but OlliOlli 2 introduces new tricks like darkslides. Each of OlliOlli 2’s levels are short gauntlets, jam-packed with stair sets, rails, ramps, deadly obstacles and – in the case of the Titan Sky levels – towering robots, hovercars, and toxic ooze. The skating is pure and skill-based. Forget steering: this is a left-to-right stream of skating consciousness, where you’re flowing gracefully from one mini set piece to the next, attempting to commune with the clever level design and trick mechanics. Flip tricks and grinds are the main tools of your trade. The former are triggered with a flick or swirl of the left analogue stick (potentially with a shoulder button held down if it’s particularly complex). So far, so similar. The innovation is that you need to catch the trick to land it, and the later you catch it, the better the rating you get – from sloppy to perfect. Tap X (or X and left or right for a manual) just before you hit the ground and you’ll be awarded a ‘perfect’ landing. Grinds are a little looser to execute, only requiring holding in one of four directions (again, potentially with one or more shoulder buttons as modifiers), but the same timing applies: move and hold the analogue stick at the last second and you’ll get a perfect rating, this time accompanied by green sparks and a speed boost. Perfect ratings mean a faster-climbing multiplier for trick combos, but they also factor into the level design in a pretty major way. Once you’re a chunk of the way through the career mode, you’ll come across grind sequences that aren’t possible to beat unless you nail the timing, or score goals that require switching grinds on the fly – which is only possible with a perfectly timed initial grind. You’ll also be required to use perfectly timed tricks off ramps to boost to the next section… or wind up broken and battered on the spikes below. The aforementioned spikes below. Thankfully, OlliOlli 2 doesn’t demand that of you initially. In fact, it gives you plenty of time to get a feel for the systems and get your eye in. By the time it starts throwing steeper challenges at you, you should be ready for them. Each of the 25 amateur levels has five challenges to beat (beyond getting to the end), and they’re a great mix, addressing every aspect of the gameplay. From combo and high-score tests through to nailing specific tricks or collecting hard-to-reach items, the challenges are a great teaching tool in their own right. It wasn’t long until I was nailing perfect single-combo runs and feeling like a badass. There’s always a steeper challenge, of course. Once you master all five challenges in an amateur level, a corresponding pro level opens up, with its own set of five. And if you can beat all 250 amateur and pro challenges, you’ll unlock another set of even harder levels. (Full disclosure – I’m nowhere even near this.) OlliOlli 2 has a learning curve that seemingly goes forever, but its pacing is expertly judged. Even challenges that I attempted upwards of 40 or 50 times didn’t leave me (too) frustrated. The mechanics are robust enough, the controls responsive enough, and the level designs finely honed enough that I was content to simply keep at it. The restarts are instantaneous, by the way. That helps a lot. Outside of the career mode’s 50 levels, there are another 50 spots to post a high score on – and see how you fare against your friends and the world. There’s even an ‘Ultimate Spots Score,’ tallying up your scores across all 50 spots. It’s a shame there’s no way to watch a replay of the top runs on the leaderboard in-game to see how the hell the score was earned, but I’m sure there’ll be plenty of videos floating around on YouTube before long. It’s also a shame that the Combo Rush mode wasn’t ready for launch. This splitscreen multiplayer mode will definitely help round out OlliOlli 2’s ways to play when it’s eventually patched in. The Olliwood premise is put to good effect. No matter, because there’s a lot of gameplay here already, and it’s tied together by an absolutely inspired makeover. The original game’s functional pixel art has been replaced by a highly stylised, flat-shaded look that’s slick and contemporary, while also echoing points of inspiration like Another World and Prince of Persia. Each of the five locations is wonderfully distinct, taking you from the film back-lots of Olliwood through to the film sets themselves, covering Aztec ruins, the wild west, a creepy amusement park, and a futuristic cityscape. It can take a few minutes to adjust to the palettes and iconography of each new setting, but overall the visual design is a triumph. It’s far smoother in motion than the original too, and the controls are every bit as responsive as you’d expect for a timing-based game. Another bonus is that OlliOlli 2 is cross-buy between PS4 and Vita, and integrates cross-save to allow you to move your game between devices. It plays really well on Vita, with the brief levels and instant restarts making it a great short-burst game while out and about. It’s definitely best on PS4, however. I found it easier to time my manuals with the Dual Shock 4’s far more robust analogue stick, and the art direction and silky frame rate are at their most impressive on a big screen.  There’s essentially no limit to how good you can get at OlliOlli 2. Just when you’ve mastered beating levels in a single combo and timing every single grind and manual perfectly, there are a host of other mechanics to integrate into your skating to bump that high score even further skyward. Why land in a boring old manual when you could revert into it? Why do a standard trick or grind when you could add a rotation or pull off something more complex with a longer – and riskier - animation? And hey, are you grind switching on every rail you can? It’s an impressively layered game, and does a great job of tapping deep into the skater psyche, where an obsession with tricks and effortless style intersect.
Brandin Tyrrel	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	 Though absolutely gorgeous and wonderfully atmospheric, The Order: 1886 is a deeply conflicted thing. Even more than its secret battle against the monsters of legend, The Order’s greatest struggle is ultimately its own internal tug-of-war between telling a beautifully presented story and granting the level of interactivity we've come to expect from a game. In the end, a lopsided commitment to perfecting style and plot comes at the cost of sluggish pacing, a look-but-don't-touch world, and paint-by-numbers gunplay. On the surface, that approach pays off. The Order is thick with exquisitely detailed environments that showcase the grand opulence of London built atop poverty-stricken slums. It’s populated by characters that are generally well-developed, motivated, and believable. And there’s a concerted effort to extend that fantastic polish into a seamless experience, merging gameplay with its many lengthy cutscenes as it delivers a generally good historical-fantasy story. In seven hours in developer Ready At Dawn’s alternate version of London, I rubbed elbows with historical figures like legendary inventor Nikola Tesla, who serves as the The Order’s gadget guy. His involvement allows for fantastic Victorian super-weapons that never were: the Arc Gun, the Thermite Rifle, and the bazooka-like Shoulder Cannon. I investigated the dealings of the famed East India Company, and heard stories of a new serial killer called Jack the Ripper. And I did all this as the strong and reserved Sir Galahad, a member of The Order – the Victorian-era incarnation of the Knights of the Round Table. By pulling these threads from history and myth, The Order: 1886 weaves an engaging and convincing patchwork of historical fiction that I want to spend time in. But I was genuinely surprised when the story abruptly ended – leaving multiple characters and secondary arcs dangling in the wind in an obvious sequel setup. It left me wanting to know what’s next for this world.  However, maintaining its scripted, linear storytelling means that when The Order must relinquish control outside of combat, it does so only enough to allow for the most basic of interactions with its world. Between lengthy cutscenes, there are long periods of restrained movement where you’re meant to simply walk, taking in the sights and listening to character dialog. It’s an issue that’s somewhat mitigated by the fact The Order: 1886 is just so damn polished, so there is plenty to keep the eye occupied, but this too suffers from diminishing returns as the super-scripted segments strip you of any freedom. Constantly being ripped from gameplay to cutscene to restrained walking segment back to cutscene is a pervasive whiplash of false starts. Even when you’re specifically instructed to touch something, there’s rarely a moment of interactivity that isn’t expressed with a quick-time event. They’re at their best when you’re trading slashes with hulking monsters – where slow reactions or imprecision will find you watching Galahad’s throat ripped out in some impressive horror-movie gore. But these moments are the exception, rather than the rule, and most of it is simply pushing carts, pulling ropes, turning levers, or flipping over carts to climb ledges or continue down the set path. When a quick-time event won’t do, we’re pushed into disappointingly generic cover-based shooting and stealth segments against equally generic, human enemies. And though these sequences are certainly interactive, The Order: 1886 does little to elevate them beyond their most basic elements. The encounters in which you actually fight the monsters that are billed as such a large part of the game are dwarfed by those in which you’re simply whack-a-mole shooting goons. I lost count of the times I traded small-arms fire with waves of hapless guards and fodder until an ally says “That’s all of them,” and it was time to move on.  Cover shooting falls into the old comfort zone where lining up the camera and popping out to kill an enemy becomes a rinse-and-repeat cycle of near invulnerability thanks to your vial of Blackwater – The Order’s secret serum you can drink (via a quick-time event) to revive yourself from the verge of death. While the weapons look great and pack some creative punch, it’s unfortunate we’re not given a lot of interesting tactical situations to shoot our way out of. Though it’s not especially challenging, the whole process of shooting is made more annoying by the ever-present black bars at the top and bottom of the screen. They're intended to create a letterboxed, “cinematic” look. But when I was behind cover, I was much more interested in being able to see what was happening in my limited vertical screen space than having a wider aspect ratio. That frustration led me to avoid crouching behind cover as much as possible, which in turn led to the majority of my deaths occurring when I left cover looking for insta-kill, quick-time melee takedowns. Rare fights against werewolves are absolutely the best parts of The Order’s action, mostly because their hit-and-run attacks are fast and less predictable than trading shots with the cookie-cutter guard, shotgunner, or sniper. Unfortunately, the knights of The Order are part-time monster hunters at best. The basic conflict at the heart of The Order: 1886 is that considerations for a cinematic approach are prioritized above the needs of basic gameplay. Its best aspects are its stunning looks, atmosphere, and style – which are truly fantastic – and entertaining fiction. But the shallow, slow, and generic quick-time event-riddled gameplay make it feel like an experience that would've been better served by a non-interactive movie than a game. With no multiplayer, and no reason to revisit the short and stunted single-player campaign once it’s been completed, there just isn’t a lot to it.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	 Playing classic adventure Grim Fandango again is like seeing a skeleton get up and start walking around – which is exactly what afterlife travel agent Manny Calavera does in this Day of the Dead-inspired tale. It joyously exhumes the corpses of both fallen genre titan LucasArts and Grim Fandango itself, whose out-of-print and unsupported status had rendered it nearly impossible to find – let alone play – over the past decade and a half. Adventure games tend to age better than other genres because their gameplay is so story-focused, and so it’s no surprise that Grim Fandango remains a fine experience in 2015. However, one missed opportunity for improvement is that, like many games of the ‘90s, there is no tutorial available. You’re simply thrown headfirst into the adventure, and any “How do I do that?” questions that would’ve been answered by the thick instruction manual you were expected to read before you played (heck, it was part of the fun!) are left a mystery here. As a $15 download, Grim Remastered obviously doesn’t include a booklet. And while you can check the button layout in the Options screen – Fandango feels completely natural on DualShock 4, by the way, and there’s a new feels-like-it-was-always-there point-and-click interface option on PC – you’re given no other context for what you’re actually supposed to do. If you’re familiar with Telltale’s modern adventures, you’ll have a basic idea, but Grim is a much deeper, more complex quest than the Walking Deads and Wolves Among Us you’re used to nowadays.  As I progressed, Grim reminded me that adventure games of yore expected a lot more from players than most games do today. That’s hardly a bad thing, but it can be a bit jarring if you’re coming to this classic for the first time. Over this beautiful and dramatic 12-hour adventure, you’ll have to talk to a lot of memorable characters, collect a lot of items, and use them in creative and often bizarre ways, so you’ll need either an excellent memory or a notepad and pen to keep track of your current goals (especially if you take a day or two off in the middle of your playthrough). It’s a lot to keep track of, and Grim Fandango won’t help you out in any way. The four-year tale of Manny as he tries to work off spiritual debts by selling expedited afterlife travel to paradise (read: heaven) so he can eventually get there himself is a gripping one, packed with film noir influences, a stellar jazzy soundtrack, and light touches of comedy too. It’s split into four years, with each one – particularly the film noir-heavy Year 2 – chock full of locations, characters, and items. Glottis, your netherworld demon sidekick whose sole reason to exist is to drive vehicles, is easily my favorite character – particularly as his role evolves into piano player, lounge singer, and shipman. But even the archetypal NPCs are well-written, well-acted, and generally interesting. I say this is a 12-hour story, but like any adventure game, you’ll only progress as fast as you can solve puzzles, and that will vary depending on how good you are at sussing out wacky adventure game logic. Most of your challenges make sense, but I wouldn’t call any of them flat-out easy. More often than not, there’s something that requires you to dig into your gray matter a bit deeper than a modern game would. Frustration is inevitable – it’s part of the genre – but when you finally figure out what you missed, it’s incredibly rewarding.  However, while I never flat-out cheated on any puzzles by looking up their solutions online, I do wish Grim Fandango Remastered had added a hint system similar to the stellar Monkey Island 1 and 2 Special Editions, which provided bigger and bigger hints as you continued to press the hint button before ultimately giving you the solution. The one puzzle that made me absolutely mental was (no spoilers) the multi-part counterfeit betting-stub machine task near the end of Year 2. Be ready for that. Just as the excellent craft behind Grim’s story means it’s no less engrossing today than it was in 1998, its 3D graphics have also held up surprisingly well. Because Grim has such unique art direction, its low-polygon characters haven’t aged as poorly as you’d expect. In fact, the original pre-rendered backgrounds help the graphics look borderline modern. Thus, switching back and forth between the original and remastered graphics on the fly only changes the characters, whose detail and lighting are cleaned up for 2015. The only thing that really disappointed me was the lack of a true 16:9 widescreen aspect ratio (a stretched 16:9 option is available, but it looks awful), which means we’re stuck with black bars on the sides of our screens. Not much has changed about the content of this game, but the developer commentary track, which serves up stories and memories from over a half-dozen key creators, including designer Tim Schafer, is a delightful cherry on top. It’s filled with fun facts and humorous retrospective observations about what was going on in the heads of the tightly bonded team who put this thing together. They’re sprinkled liberally throughout the story, and they’re only a button press away. And since the commentary almost never spoils puzzles, I highly recommend turning it on in the Special Features menu before you begin.   Should you elect to play Grim Fandango Remastered on the Vita, you’ll be in for a portable treat. The handheld version cleverly offers both the PS4’s gamepad controls and the PC’s point-and-click controls simultaneously, letting you mix and match on the fly and on a whim. Visuals look clean on the Vita’s screen, too, though the 4:3 aspect ratio is extra painful here because of the already limited screen real estate (again, do not attempt to use the hideous 16:9 stretching option). On a similar note, the Vita’s screen also occasionally stings during scenes when the camera is pulled way back, making Manny a mere few pixels tall. But Cross-Buy and Cross-Save functionality means your $15 gets you both PlayStation versions, and you’re able to seamlessly carry your save files back and forth between the two. That’s a huge plus. The passage of time has done little to diminish Grim Fandango’s reputation as one of the finest adventure games ever made, and the fact that so little needed to be done to modernize it only reinforces its place as a classic of the genre. While it may seem punishing at times to modern gamers, remember that failure is impossible. I wish this new version had incorporated a hint system to make it more accessible to the new generation, but whether you’ve never played Grim Fandango before or you replay it every year and just want to dive into Remastered for the insightful developer commentary track, this is a reverent re-release whose few bygone era warts are minimized by its timeless story.
Meghan Sullivan	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/22/citizens-of-earth-review	 Citizens of Earth’s tongue-placed-firmly-in-cheek satire on retro games and modern politics had me laughing even when I was cursing it out. The story of a clueless Vice President and his equally bumbling constituents saving the Earth from evil isn’t a novel idea, but the amusing dialogue and lovable cast of characters managed to get me through the 20-hour experience even when the sluggish pacing and technical glitches threatened to kill my joy for it. Much of Citizens’ charm lies in the fact that it’s a giant spoof on Earthbound. Everything, from the world design to the battle animation to the fact that you can dumpster-dive for items, is lifted straight from the ‘90s cult classic. Naturally, this appealed to my sense of 8- and 16-bit nostalgia, but Citizens didn’t just rely on fuzzy memory of days gone by in order to charm me. It also introduced a litany of hilarious characters who represent the best and worst of what humanity has to offer. A plethora of quirky archetypes was available to recruit into my party: the crazy conspiracy nut, the laid-back Jamaican musician, the cheerful German pastry chef, the spiritual yoga instructor, and of course the narcissistic Vice President of the World. Vote for Earth! But it’s the political satire and sly pop culture references sprinkled throughout the wonderfully enthusiastic dialogue that really makes Citizens pop. Almost every line is either a playful dig at self-centered politicians (“My hair is what I do best,” the Vice President proudly declares) or a reference to movies like Labyrinth (“Voodoo.” “Who do?”). If the pacing were as snappy as the dialogue, I’d have enjoyed Citizens of Earth even more. Unfortunately, a confusing overworld map and a terrible hint system turned smooth sailing into abominable gridlock. Whenever I was instructed to go somewhere, it was in the vaguest terms possible: “Go to the desert and find a way to the building.” This real bit of instruction may sound like a no-brainer, but the process of getting to said building was ridiculously convoluted. I spent hours searching for an entrance, checking the map over and over (and over) again looking for hidden caves or trails. I even got up from my chair to trace paths on the map with my finger. Where was the heck was the entrance? As it turns out, I had to go to the area next to the desert, visit a casino, make my way across a river, then circle back to the desert from a different direction – none of which felt the least bit intuitive. Add to that a pack of tenacious cats made out of cacti attacking my party every three seconds (high enemy-encounter rates are another pacing issue) and it was a wonder I made it to the end of the mission. I’m aware that developer Eden Industries set out to recreate the style and feel of the 16-bit era, but we moved beyond maps and frequent enemy encounters for a reason. Luckily, the sluggish tempo on the world map doesn’t carry over into battles. Fights are quick and fun thanks to each of the 40 citizens’ quirky set of attacks, buffs, and defenses. In a clever twist, the VP himself doesn’t fight – he just stands there making quips and letting everyone else do the work for him. I chuckled whenever the computer nerd attacked enemies using hexadecimal and binary code, the bodybuilder used buffs to power up his next move, or the baker healed the party with copious amounts of pastries. I also appreciated that each citizen had a secondary talent off the battlefield. I couldn’t have gotten very far without the help of the spunky helicopter pilot who flew me to remote locations, or the dumb-as-bricks bodybuilder who lifted obstacles out of my way. It’s this mix of abilities that made having an array of citizens in my party essential as well as fun. We promise a Moonbucks on every corner! The process of getting them on my team wasn’t fun, however. Almost every single character required me to complete a sidequest or compete with them in a mini-game, and those were just as poorly designed and unintuitive as the main quests. The only reason I managed to recruit the photographer was because I accidentally stumbled onto a location she wanted to use for a photoshoot. And, alas, there are technical glitches. There were times I got stuck trying to get around obstacles while driving or walking. There is noticeable screen tearing. And although It only happened to me a couple of times on PC, the PS4 version crashed on me several times. Thank goodness for autosave! Annoying as that was it was hard to stay mad for very long, since the constant jokes, retro-style graphics pulled straight from the ‘50s and kooky music worked together to keep a grin on my face. And if things did get too tedious, I could always use the school mascot in my party to change the difficulty level or the floating photon I came across to speed up the gameplay. Citizens of Earth is a quirky game with its heart in the right place and its head in the clouds. It charmed me with its blend of old-school RPG and contemporary satire, but nearly lost my vote with its sluggish pacing, irritatingly high enemy encounter rate, and crashes. As it is, it’s pretty A-OK, but it would have a tough race winning a run-off for my time against a well-paced RPG.
Mike Mitchell	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/super-mega-baseball-review	 Super Mega Baseball is a wonderfully goofy arcade baseball game that harkens back to the days of yore - by which I mean the 1990s. The whole time I was playing it, I couldn’t help but think how much my 10-year-old self would’ve killed for a game like this. It’s simple to pick up and play, it’s extremely fun in small doses, and yet it has a surprising amount of depth if you stick around. But you don’t have to be an ‘80s kid or even a huge baseball fan in order to have fun playing Super Mega Baseball.  The first thing I noticed is the humor. Without an MLB license to worry about, developer Metalhead Software had the freedom to make creative caricatures out of team mascots, players, umpires, and stadiums. I couldn’t help but chuckle when Chugg Burbony was pitching to Harry Backman, while the umpire called balls and strikes with a silly Christian Bale era Batman voice. The controls are as intuitive and easy to understand as any baseball game I’ve ever played. To swing the bat, you can simply press X, but I found it much easier to get the timing right when I pulled the right analog stick down to first draw the bat back, and then pushed it up to execute the swing. Playing defense is almost completely automatic, except for jumping, diving, and throwing. This drastically streamlines the entire flow of the game and keeps the frustration to a minimum. Once you get the hang of it all, it’s easy to adjust your Ego – essentially the difficulty level – from 0 (easy) all the way up to 99 (impossible), which made me feel like I was constantly pushing myself to improve my skills. Furthermore, when playing local multiplayer, each player can adjust their Ego independently, basically acting as a handicap that allows you to play with anybody, regardless of skill level. Character models, however, look like they came from a Wii Sports game, and their limited customization options mean you can expect to see slight variations of the same faces over and over. In fact, the presentation in general is a bit lackluster. The menus are generic, the cut scene animations are repetitive, and the music is grating, which makes it more suitable for short game sessions. Outside of the standard exhibition mode (which allows up to four-player couch co-op), the only other way you can play Super Mega Baseball is season mode, which has a surprising level of depth. Completing games allows you to level up, which unlocks training staff that can be hired for a temporary rating boost to your players, allowing your team to constantly evolve. For example, the Yoga Class boost gives your player +3 in fielding, while Plyometrics gives +2 in both speed and arm strength. Additionally, a wide variety stat-tracking data is readily available, from batting average to OPS, which encouraged me to keep playing to pad my stats. Super Mega Baseball is a blast to play in short bursts. The controls are simple and intuitive, and the difficulty can be adjusted to any skill level. There are no online game modes, but the season mode is surprisingly deep, with a leveling system and complete stat tracking that keep me coming back for more. The lackluster presentation, however, hinders the overall experience, making it difficult to play more than a few games per sitting.
Dave Rudden	http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/02/loadout-playstation-4-review	" I thought Loadout could have been PlayStation 4's equivalent of Team Fortress 2; a colorful, light-hearted, arcade-style, free-to-play shooter with crazy customization. Unfortunately, too much of Loadout weighed on me. When I didn't spend real money, the experience was too oppressive. When I started playing with money, there were still some unforgivable issues in the way matches are set up.  As far as third-person shooters go, Loadout is decent in terms of gameplay. Character movement is floatier than most shooters, but I got used to the pace within a few matches. The speediness of the combat was the bigger challenge to acclimate to; scopes are nearly useless, and headshots are a rarity. I did appreciate the abundance of arcade-inspired damage indicators, though – between giant glowing numbers and loud chimes, I always knew when I'd hit my mark. There are both a co-op PvE campaign and PvP competitive matches in Loadout (both are always team-based and max out at four on four). The campaign and its bare-minimum backstory is a series of 50-plus matches against an AI-controlled aliens, each carrying stipulations given by unseen characters. A military commander will need help with enemies twice as strong as usual, an arms dealer will want some kills with a certain weapon, or a director may want a few headshots for gory movie footage. A simple character portrait would have done wonders to give them personality, but all we get are a few sentences of mission-select screen text. Fortunately, the guns got me excited for battles when the mission setup didn't. The weapon-crafting system is insane, as each weapon type has at least seven customizable parts, from the trigger to the scope. I was able to make some pretty powerful and fun weapons, though there's some trial and error involved. For every hit, like my full-auto Tesla beam that spreads through groups of enemies, I'd usually find another that looked good statistically and performed decently during target practice but fell flat in combat. Even with the duds, I enjoyed tinkering with my guns. I can't say the same for Loadout's attempt to infuse its characters with personality. They’re are actually more fun dead than alive - getting limbs shot off or faces removed (leaving an eyes-only visage reminiscent of Assassin's Creed Unity's launch glitches) is fine, and the overwrought death animations are better than motionless fatalities. They're also better when you earn a rare costume item instead of buying into the glut of high-priced tchochkes. Fortunately, I wasn't enticed to spend, since much of Loadout's customizable items trade in crude humor. For some folks, giving the busty, big-boned “Helga” character the “Fattoo” skin, thong underwear, and a twerking taunt might elicit a chuckle, but it just came across as trying too hard to be outrageous.  The bigger issue is that while the campaign match types are completely randomized, stipulations aren't matched to complementary modes. In many cases, that led to stipulations completely incongruous to a match. A level with a stipulation asking for a number of rocket kills would be perfect for a ""find and capture randomized points"" mode, but usually I'd get thrown into something completely different at first like Death Snatch, where the Kill Confirmed-style rules wouldn't allow me to fire up-close rockets at enemies. There’s no option to repeat a match type, either, so a lot of the campaign's strategy is ""wait until a compatible match pops up."" Since progression through the campaign requires both a victory in battle and completing the personal objectives, I had many frustrating experiences of letting my team down while just eking out an ultimately meaningless objective, or setting aside my personal gain for the team, knowing another long match laid ahead with the same stipulations. That isn’t a fun decision to make. While Loadout isn't impossible to play free, I did have to do an insane amount of prepping and micromanaging to stand a chance without paying. Apropos to its name, there's only a single loadout to manage when you start, and while that may have been beneficial to learning the ins and outs of weaponcrafting, the prohibitive cost of purchasing a second slot made for awkward rounds where I brought the wrong weapons to battle and had to debate between ditching my team or spending the next 10 minutes with a losing strategy. When I did start investing even a modicum of real-world money into Loadout, the results were pretty shocking in the campaign. I went from barely winning missions, maintaining a K:D ratio of 1.5:1 and rarely earning match MVP awards, to a team-carrying monster with double-digit killstreaks. In a way, I preferred the free experience – while it was much more of a grind early on, I feel way more accomplishment with a hard-fought victory than I do rolling over the opposition. Even when spending, I was often frustrated by missions requiring a certain ammo type that I ended up purchasing, only to reward me with a bounty of said ammo type. When it came to the PvP multiplayer, it was nice to see that the equalized levels made money less important, and limited the pay-to-win feel to the co-op corner. However, outside of the more robust choices available when playing an invite-only match, the standard public matches are sparse when it comes to options, putting the mode to a vote and randomizing everything else. The underappreciated ""Jackhammer"" mode, where one team defends a giant crane while the other attacks it, almost never wins public vote, and I wish there was a way to find a match besides corralling friends. I had some fun free-to-play battles with Loadout, but far more time was spent mired in frustration or feeling under-fulfilled with a purchased campaign victory; it's not quite ""pay to win,"" but it definitely is ""pay to win with a lot less hassle."" Even though the campaign promises over 50 unique co-op situations, almost all of my fondest Loadout memories came during PvP matches – even if I looked and taunted a lot like everyone else."
Darry Husky	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/16/guilty-gear-xrd-sign-review	 Shredding guitars, spiky hair, pirate girls riding flying dolphins, and a posterior-poking surgeon in a paper bag mask can mean only one thing: Guilty Gear Xrd -SIGN- is finally here. With Xrd (pronounced “Ex Ard”, and your guess is as good as mine), Guilty Gear takes a cue from Street Fighter 4 and Killer Instinct in pulling the series closer to its roots, and its incredibly unique characters and rich combat will test fight fan’s abilities in incredibly rewarding ways.  One of the most noticeable elements of Guilty Gear Xrd is its colorful, imaginative character design. Guilty Gear Xrd’s protagonists are a weird, interesting, and often amusing cast of misfits; a steady breath of fresh air compared to the karate guys and ninja gals that pad many fighting game rosters. Each member of Guilty Gear Xrd’s roster is wholly distinct in their core mechanics and the way they are played. While Sol and Ky feel vaguely like Ken and Ryu, it is here that familiar ground begins to fade away, replaced by sheer insanity in the form of projectiles from all angles, teleporting minions, and levitating sword traps. Warriors like Zato-1 can use his ally, Eddie, to attack an enemy from both sides, or to feign an offensive maneuver. Chipp can use his speed and his ability to teleport to confuse his opponents and break through their defenses. There’s a character to suit every style, and no two feel alike. If you’re new to games like Guilty Gear, Xrd is packed with loads of helpful tutorials and challenge modes to ease you into the action. The tutorials are impressive in their depth, covering all the basics before detailing advanced concepts like mix-ups, zoning and space control, and more. The challenge modes introduce each character’s unique special moves and teach a broad mix of combos, covering a range of options including standard bread and butter combos, anti-air punishes, and counter-hit combos. These instructional modes teach not only entry-level mechanics unique to Guilty Gear Xrd, they also impart knowledge of fundamental concepts present in most two-dimensional fighting games. With them, Guilty Gear Xrd does an admirable job of making it all accessible not only for those of us making the jump from other fighting games, but for those checking the genre out for the very first time.  Rest assured, however, that despite its commendable approach to newbies, Guilty Gear Xrd is a game whose learning curve ramps from gentle slope to sheer brick wall seemingly in the blink of an eye. This is an incredibly complex and technical battleground populated by some of the most imaginative and downright bizarre protagonists in any game, anywhere. It will push your dexterity and reactions, and reward your patience. Memorizing basic combos opens the door to learn exponentially more difficult ones incorporating mid-air dashes, double jumps, counter hits, and more. Learning new ways to unleash the offensive potential of my character left me with a sense of satisfaction; taking that knowledge into an actual match and executing it correctly imparted a sense of pride. While Xrd will feel immediately familiar to long-time Guilty Gear fans, a surprising amount has changed. The Roman Cancel system returns in expanded form, allowing players to cancel out of virtually any attack animation, whether it made contact with the opponent or not - a first for the Guilty Gear series. Dust Attacks, which launch your target far into the air to be juggled, have also been expanded upon, with Xrd implementing a dashing follow-up which opens all new combo options to utilize against enemies in the corner. Then there’s the Blitz Shield, a powerful new defensive tool that can quickly reverse the momentum of a match, giving you breathing room against an especially aggressive opponent. Xrd has enough new features and mechanics to feel like a true sequel, while excellently retaining many of the classic elements that impart the good old feeling of a Guilty Gear game. The very same goes for Xrd’s look. In combat, colors abound, with the three-dimensional combatants cell-shaded so as to replicate the series’ traditional two-dimensional sprites. Battles unfold amidst gorgeously-rendered backgrounds. Each of the characters sport hundreds of unique animations that breathe life into both old favorites and new challengers. The fights are amplified by the heavy metal soundtrack, another Guilty Gear convention done justice. Guilty Gear Xrd’s multi-player modes are the standard fare for fighting games, at this point. You can engage in duels with your friends from the couch, or you can take your skills online to challenge players from around the world in Player Matches or Ranked Matches. The addition of cross-play between PS3 and PS4 is a welcome addition, but Xrd’s online matchmaking lobbies are arranged oddly. The somewhat un-intuitive interface sometimes makes it difficult to find opponents quickly. In addition, Xrd’s netcode can make it difficult to connect to the matches you do finally manage to sift out, and once connected, even steady connections can suffer from stuttering and other latency issues. Guilty Gear Xrd has enough wacky characters and well-crafted tutorials to be interesting for novices, but it’s those of us seeking a challenge that will find the most to love here. The online experience is a little rough, but its wildly diverse cast, and its dynamic, offense-oriented combat system makes Guilty Gear Xrd a triumphant, long-awaited return for this venerable fighting game franchise.
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/05/secret-ponchos-review	" There are plenty of reasons to love Westerns – the wide-open spaces, the brutal lawlessness, the way the setting can so easily convey any kind of symbolism – but for most people, it all boils down to one thing: larger-than-life personalities locked in deadly shootouts. Secret Ponchos focuses on that to the exclusion of all else, delivering a cartoony, multiplayer-only twin-stick shooter in which your only goal is to gun down hyper-stylized opponents while frantically dodging their bullets. Short on content but unexpectedly complex, its oddball gunfighters and cover-filled arenas are a lot of fun… once you've played long enough to understand what you're doing, anyway.  There's no tutorial or even a practice mode here, so the intricacies of Secret Ponchos' five distinct characters have to be discovered on live battlefields. There are some similarities; all outlaws have a dodge/dash move powered by a limited stamina bar, everyone can become temporarily invisible by sticking to cover, and their weapons all carry small ammo stocks that have to be manually reloaded. Beyond that, each fighter is a new experience, with two unique weapons, multiple attacks, and different handling, all of which require different strategies. Having to figure all this out while other players are aggressively shooting at you leads to a lot of frustration early on, but at least there’s a ""Rookie"" option to match you with players who are going through the same trial by fire. It'll likely take some trial and error just to find a duelist you're comfortable with. The old, bearded Killer's middle-of-the-road stats made him seem like a good starting option, for example, but his slow firing rate and movement are clearly meant for more precise players than me. The same went for The Matador, whose primary weapons – two slow-to-reload banderillas (think bullfighting harpoons) – distract from the fact that she's much more capable at close range, with three distinct, devastating attacks available for her ""secondary"" sword and cape. Less meticulous players will want to check out The Deserter, a hulking cavalry soldier who can fire short-range bursts or long-range sniper shots (as well as bowl opponents over with his dodge/dash move); or the Phantom Poncho, a skull-faced bandito with a sawed-off shotgun and a long bullwhip that stuns and then slows anyone it hits. For my part, I finally settled on the low-difficulty Kid Red: a fast-moving, fast-shooting ragamuffin who can hurl dynamite and briefly stun opponents with a special shot from his paired pistols. (I wasn't alone, either, as other Kid Reds quickly filled online matches in the first few days of release.) Once you've felt out a character's limitations and settled on strategies for using them effectively against other fighters, testing your skills against other players becomes immensely fun and rewarding. That's not the only reason it's important to settle on one character, though – at least at first. Each of your fighters progresses separately, with experience tallied as a bounty; win matches, and it'll grow, letting you increase your fighter's health, firing rate, speed, damage, and stamina regeneration as you reach new levels. This does a lot to foster an attachment to your character, especially since you get to name them (sadly, alternate costumes are available only as paid DLC). The twist here is that you're effectively wagering a chunk of your bounty on every match; losses or poor performance can decrease your bounty and hinder your progress, and that feeling of having something on the line definitely makes things more tense – and gives teammates a justifiable reason to be mad at anyone who doesn't pull their weight. Yet as enjoyable and unexpectedly deep as the combat can be, Secret Ponchos simply doesn't have much to progress through once you've mastered its five fighters. It comes with just four stages and three modes – free-for-all, team deathmatch, and domination – and while it's possible to mix things up a bit by changing the number of players,  working out strategies for playing alongside different characters, or playing with a friend in the same room via split-screen, things start feeling repetitive before long. It's also worth pointing out that deathmatch and domination are essentially identical, except that the former gives each player a single life over three rounds, while the latter has teams fight over a sliding kill meter, with automatic victory handed to the side that pulls ahead by five. This gives each mode a slightly different feel, but ""slightly"" is disappointing when it's all that's on offer. Finally, Secret Ponchos still has a number of bugs that need to be hammered out. While they seem to be less common after a few post-release patches (I haven't been thrown into any matches lately where I could only shoot myself, for example), it's still not unusual to see animation glitches or, more annoyingly, matches that stall out in the lobby just as they claim to be launching, at which point everyone usually leaves in a huff, one by one. Usually, you can just quit and find another match quickly, but seeing a lobby simply stall out after waiting for it to fill up and count down is always infuriating. It’s even more so when you consider that matches can sometimes take minutes to set up, only to be over in seconds if one team mops the floor with the other. Abnormally complex and pretty for a twin-stick arena shooter, Secret Ponchos throws you into the deep end and demands you figure things out for yourself, usually while under heavy fire. Stick it out, however, and the real fun starts to shine through. While the experience is hamstrung by glitches and a general lack of content, there are enough rewarding opportunities for discovery and creative strategy here to keep determined players entertained for at least a few days."
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	 Permanent death of a character is one of the most extreme punishments a game can dole out. In The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, a rare balance is struck where its brutal bullet-hell difficulty isn’t a punishment, but an opportunity to see something totally new. Because of excellent randomization and seemingly endless content, I’m still seeing items, bosses, and entirely new types of dungeons even after 30 hours of intense twin-stick shooter-style battle. And, every so often, I pause for a moment and appreciate that I’m playing as a traumatized, naked child who’s destroying poop monsters and zombie babies by crying on them because his crazy mother tried to kill him. So it’s something we can all relate to.  While its randomized maps and collectable hearts, keys, and bombs resemble the dungeons of the original Legend of Zelda, the skills involved in surviving here are more about mastering your tear projectiles, which are are affected by your momentum at the moment you fire them. That enables a surprising depth in trick shots that can be launched further than their inherent range or curve off their natural four-directional path. However, because of the perspective, it can be hard to hit flying enemies, or large ones, due to shots passing behind their sprites when they appear to be on target. One of the best things about The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is that every time I play, Isaac ends up looking and behaving radically differently – usually within a few moments of starting a run. He begins as a strangely adorable big-headed pink child with teary eyes that launch projectiles at enemies with typical twin-stick shooter controls, but picking up an item from behind a golden door can enhance his powers while disfiguring him in one of a hundred different horrible ways. One time you might pick up an item that turns him into a cyclops that fires huge mega-tears, and the next you’ll find a powerup that’ll embed a meteorite in his head and cause his tears to orbit around him. Even better, if you find one and then the other, Isaac will become a cyclops with a meteorite embedded in his head, with giant, powerful tears orbiting him and obliterating any flies or spiders or bloated corpse-babies nearby. Those continue to stack as you move from dungeon to dungeon, which sometimes allows you to become wildly overpowered - and yet still vulnerable to an unforeseen enemy type or stepping on spikes. You lose everything when you die, so the stakes rise with every promising new discovery. It keeps you guessing and adapting to new powers and challenges, all the while rewarding you with a huge variety of creepy-cute artwork. What’s a bit annoying is how little information The Binding of Isaac gives you when you discover one of its hundreds of pickups. For example, when I pick up a piece of petrified poop, “It feels lucky?” flashes across the screen, but if I hadn’t looked up what it does exactly on an external wiki, I might never have figured out its exact function. I’m a big fan of the process of experimenting and discovering those abilities on my own, but some kind of built-in mechanism for remembering what they do would’ve been a big help, considering that in my hundreds of playthroughs there have been multiple items I’ve still only seen once, and new ones are still being unlocked all the time. Enemy variety is off the charts, too, with dozens of different attack patterns to learn and adapt to. The movement and attack patterns of several different types of spiders, hostile feces, ghosts, zombies, centipedes, blobs, floating heads, burrowing worms, shielded skull-inhabiting fleshy creatures, and way more are all different, and just when I think I’ve got them figured out, they throw new combinations or variants at me and send me back to the beginning, where the whole cycle begins again - sometimes with an unlockable alternate character that changes up my starting stats. The time I’ve spent with Binding of Isaac: Rebirth has been non-stop fun and surprises, with just a tad too much frustration when I lose a rare item. But even when it slaps me down harder than I’d have liked, starting again is always a treat, because I’m likely to discover something new and darkly comedic. That’s plenty of motivation to keep right on playing this amazing game.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1-zero-sum-review	 You don’t need to be a hardcore Borderlands fan to love Tales From the Borderlands. By exploring the world of the loot-driven shooter trilogy through the lens of a dialogue-heavy adventure game, Telltale has created a fantastic opening to a story rife with humor, interesting characters, powerful decisions, and effective mysteries. In the span of Episode 1: Zer0 Sum’s two and a half hours, Rhys and Fiona became some of the best lead characters Telltale has ever created, and I’m entirely on board for their journey. Traditional Borderlands games have you interacting with the world mostly through emptying the chambers of your various guns, but Telltale pretty much strips you of power save for you wit. Talking my way out of a deal gone bad, watching the face of my adversary to see whether or not they believe me, and choosing how far to take a lie was as tense as any shootout I’ve ever experienced on Pandora. The entire thing is enhanced by a fantastic score that draws from classic westerns, Cowboy Bebop-esque jazz, and some great nods to various Borderlands themes.   The framing device in Zer0 Sum has Rhys and Fiona retelling the story of their initial meeting – a heist gone awry – and how the stakes quickly began to ratchet up to some pretty massive levels. Tales jumps back and forth between the pair, which results in some really great situations and moments to story reveals. Watching a deal go south from Rhys’ point of view and thinking you know the ins-and-outs of the scene, only to have everything turned on its head once you flesh in the details from Fiona’s perspective constantly gave the episode a great sense of pace and aggressive, effective storytelling.  While having prior Borderlands knowledge helps add a bit of context to the relationship between Hyperion and Pandora, why Zer0 is so rad, and just who the hell Handsome Jack is and why he’s so notorious, newcomers will be just fine in Tales. This is mostly thanks to how strong of characters Rhys and Fiona are, and how great it is to be able to shade them in with your own unique decisions. Does your Rhys want people to view him as a fearsome murderer, or a genius with a silver tongue? If your Fiona has a clean shot at a target, does she take it, or would she rather get out of a situation with as a low a bodycount as possible? In the quick duration of Zer0 Sum, I fell in love with my versions of these two characters, and I can’t wait to see where they go from here. Tales from the Borderlands hits humorous notes through its dialogue, situations, and even elements of its menus. Characters are introduced with the series’ signature over-the-top title cards, and using Rhys’ ability to scan people and items in the environment leads to a ton of often-hilarious fun facts. Great writing and fantastic acting make each scene a joy to play through, and I found myself genuinely laughing out loud every few minutes of the first episode.   While the traditional Telltale mechanics of dialogue trees and tough decisions work as well as ever in Borderlands, the new currency system feels half-baked. Fiona is able to accumulate money through our various decisions and actions, like finding hidden chests or choosing whether or not to pillage some cash from a dying man. While I like this concept in theory, its execution is a bit clunky. The amount of money I was carrying dropped between two scenes for no apparent reason, and the actual things you can spend it on seems entirely superficial. Maybe there are big plans for buying your way into or out of trouble in future episodes, but for now money is the root of most of Tales from the Borderlands’ evils. Like Walking Dead and Wolf Among Us, Tales is almost entirely devoid of puzzles, instead focusing on dialogue choices and character development. I’m absolutely fine with this, but there are a few instances where I was forced to do a mundane action like push a cart across the screen and use it to climb up into a vent. Actions like this came across as tedious, and took me out of the story and the world for a brief moment. Speaking of action, the chase scene near the end feels like a step back from the action scenes in The Wolf Among Us. Where Telltale’s take on Fables allows us to make some decisions in choreographing the flow of fight scenes, Borderlands relies heavily on pass/fail quick-ime events. For example, I scratched my nose during the action, and found myself dead and forced to restart the scene. You rarely even die that quickly in Borderlands 2. Any of Tales from the Borderlands Episode 1: Zer0 Sum’s minor setbacks feel like nothing when put up against the strength of the characters, the caliber of the writing, and the charm of the world. With only a brief introduction to Rhys and Fiona, they have already become a pair of my favorite Telltale characters, and the fantastic final scene of the Zer0 Sum has be anxiously awaiting my return trip to Pandora.
Lucy O'Brien	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/littlebigplanet-3-review	 A LittleBigPlanet game has many moving parts, and LittleBigPlanet 3 showcases what can go wrong when they aren't quite properly aligned, despite a valiant attempt. New developer Sumo Digital created an enormous puzzle-platformer with equally enormous scope for creation and an enjoyable single-player experience; however, it is undermined by unimaginative co-op and a number of game-breaking bugs. First things first: for anybody worried that the absence of original LittleBigPlanet developer Media Molecule might mean an absence of the series’ signature charm, fear not. From its title sequence - narrated by the reliably delightful Stephen Fry - onward, LittleBigPlanet 3’s style is a wonderful brew of humor and effervescence, and its central message of ‘play, create, share’ is thankfully continued, in both tone and structure.   There is more emphasis on story this time around, though. All the supporting characters in LittleBigPlanet 3 are now voiced, and cutscenes tell of an animated attack on the ‘magnificent moon of wonder’ planet called Bunkam that has sucked away its inhabitant’s creativity. While I was initially wary that more traditional video game storytelling might feel out of place in a world that has always delighted in the surreal, I found LittleBigPlanet’s simple narrative unobtrusive and fun, and its characters idiosyncratically weird. Individual story levels in LittleBigPlanet’s seven- to eight-hour Adventure mode are beautifully designed. Where LittleBigPlanet 2’s aesthetic is all neon and electricity, the look this time around has been modeled after the stage and screen. Levels take place in abstract renditions of ‘50s monster movie sets and ballet performances, marionette theaters and workshops, all with that familiar LittleBigPlanet overlay of an artsy design magazine and a killer soundtrack. The three new story-mode hubs – explorable, sprawling worlds in their own right – are just as gorgeous; the Eastern European-Christmas-themed Ziggurat Hub is one of the more romantic places I’ve ever visited in a video game. Although LittleBigPlanet 3 still occasionally suffers from the same floaty controls bucking up against some level designs that demand very precise platforming, these story levels – and optional ‘challenge levels’ – are imaginative enough that I could (mostly) forgive the issue. It’s thanks to a handful of great new additions that gameplay is more frenetic than in the past two games; the Portal-esque ‘Velociporter’, for example, can send Sackboy from the background to the foreground in a blink; while new powerups such as ‘Boost Boots’ and the teleporting ‘Blink Ball’ gun open up new ways to bounce across the screen.   LittleBigPlanet 3’s cuddly new characters add a unique dynamic to gameplay, although it’s disappointing - and surprising, considering the pre-launch marketing - how little they are actually used. While Swoop (who can fly and grab), Oddsock (who can run fast and bounce off walls) and Toggle (who can switch between being heavy and light) each get to headline a level upon introduction, they are only intermittently used elsewhere in Adventure mode. Seeing how much fun playing as these characters is, this feels like a missed opportunity. Limited use of the broader cast extends to cooperative play, as LittleBigPlanet 3 curiously insists you and your co-op partner(s) have to play as the the same character in individual levels. I found only one instance where this was not that case, and that particular level was so cleverly orchestrated, utilizing all skillsets in a frantic race against the clock, I am dumbfounded there weren’t more like it. Even more confusing is why that standout level would be hidden away, where many people might miss it altogether. But the most damning aspect of Adventure mode, and LittleBigPlanet 3 as a whole, is the number of bugs I encountered while playing it. Across two PlayStation 4 systems, my (already patched) game encountered frequent frame rate stuttering, crashed multiple times and glitched out so I couldn’t respawn after dying. I fell through levels into floaty purgatory twice, and some of the plentiful loading screens became stuck. Twice during a boss chase, my co-op partner and I were left stranded after spawning mid-way through the level, because the level hadn’t reset itself. Again, this is with the zero-day patch installed.  Fortunately, perhaps because it operates at a much slower pace, I had no such issues with LittleBigPlanet 3’s Creation Mode. Here, Sumo Digital has stood on the shoulders of giants, leaving Media Molecule’s (relatively) accessible, yet hefty LittleBigPlanet 2 toolkit intact, and adding a handful of significant upgrades that promises greater sophistication in level-building. You can now create in 16 layers. Weaned on LittleBigPlanet 2’s comparably simple three layers, I found this initially daunting and awkward, but after a few hours of playing in level creator I got the gist – if not the hang of – the new depth of field. It’s telling that despite hours’ worth of mortifyingly terrible attempts at creating a decent-looking level with proper depth, I want to go back and play with it some more.  Elsewhere, the ‘Blaster Handle’, which allows you to imagine your own power ups, has enormous potential, as does the quietly revelatory ‘Popit Powerup’. This tool is responsible for LittleBigPlanet 3’s Popit Academy: 12 platforming levels designed to teach you Creation Mode basics. These levels essentially blur the line between ‘create’ and ‘play’ by tasking you to solve puzzles using your creation toolkit. They are fun and cleverly designed – in fact, I enjoyed a handful of them more than some of the Adventure mode levels – and suggest a paradigm shift for how we could play user-generated levels moving forward. Such additions promise to open up LittleBigPlanet’s world significantly, and as we know from the nine million-plus user-generated levels included from previous games on the disc (that’s an impressive amount of ‘DLC’), there will be no shortage of people to take advantage of them. It’s exciting to watch as a new LittleBigPlanet game is let loose into the wild, and wonder how it might be pulled apart, put back together, and blown up in the future. LittleBigPlanet 3 is an enormous - and, at times, unruly - game. It’s Adventure mode is beautifully designed, and new power-ups and character abilities switch up the usual bread-and-butter platforming gameplay, but it’s let down by limited options for co-operative play and most significantly, a number of game-breaking bugs on the PlayStation 4. While a little daunting for newcomers, its supersized creation tookit has enormous potential for creating deep and diverse play, and it’s here where LittleBigPlanet 3 justifies its existence. [Editor's note - a Day One patch for LittleBigPlanet 3 may resolve some of the bug issues, but we have gone over the upcoming list of fixes and there weren't enough pertinent to our experience to justify changing the score].
Jake Magee	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	 Natural Doctrine takes the concept of natural selection and throws it in your face; the world is brutal, cold and unyielding, and you’re going to have a hard time surviving in it. The story is nothing more than an excuse to go out and kill stuff, and the gameplay is just as unforgiving as humanity’s struggle for survival in a world where other races and species are vying for dominance. Natural Doctrine tries to challenge even the most elite tactical RPG veterans, but it ends up being infuriatingly unfair - filling its 40-hour campaign with rage-inducing battles.  Perhaps Natural Doctrine’s greatest failing is in how it struggles to convey its needlessly complex combat system (and no, the quick tutorial and walls of text that “teach” you how to play aren’t much help). During a turn, every unit has the ability to have other allies go immediately after them through Link Turns. The criteria for linking attacks is as convoluted as the user interface; after somehow managing to link my entire team into one huge attack, my screen is a comical mess of lines, colors, and even upside-down scrolling text. It’s an aggravating and unbalanced system that favors strength in numbers. The problem is that I was almost always outnumbered, meaning when it was the enemy’s turn, they relentlessly assaulted me, leading to constant deaths. On the rare occasion my team was larger (this only happened during a few boss fights), the enemy inexplicably got “Quick Turns,” allowing them to constantly skip turn order and go first, making the fights even more one-sided than they already were. Worst of all is the fact that there’s no saving during the often long and grueling battles. Checkpoints are sparse, so the often unavoidable losses I suffered stung that much worse. During one fight, I had to defeat a small army while keeping the enemy’s leader alive. I spent 45 minutes defending my team while chipping away at the opponents’ health with my snipers only for the leader to rush in, auto-triggering my riflemen’s covering fire ability. I watched in horror as my stupid teammates unwittingly killed the one person they were tasked to keep alive, effectively erasing nearly an hour’s worth of progress. In another lengthy fight against a dozen dragons, I had the help of an AI-controlled goblin wizard. He decided to use a fireball on one of them, catching my characters in the crossfire. Twenty minutes of progress were deleted thanks to friendly fire outside my control. Natural Doctrine constantly worked against me—even when it was on my side. Even on the easiest difficulty, a character’s death means an instant game over and thanks to constant occurrences like the ones described above, my characters died a lot. By the end of the game, my team was so big that I was managing ten separate health bars at once, constantly worrying that one would get hit by a critical attack for an instant loss, which happened far too often.  It’s as if Natural Doctrine expected me to know every move my opponents would make—even implausible ones—which meant my victories weren’t based on tactics or strategy but constant trial and error, and dumb luck.  Fortunately, the game allows you to respec skills at any point at no cost, but no amount of skill swapping could change how poorly magic is handled. Instead of the traditional mana, humans use grams of Pluton, a fictional element, to cast spells. The issue is that it’s a finite resource, and getting more of it is hard. Pluton is found in chests in the dungeons and caves you explore, but opening them during battle is suicide because it wastes a full turn. By the final levels, I was so low on Pluton that my mages were literally worthless wastes of turns I was forced to keep alive. To make matters worse, Natural Doctrine is punctuated by a forgettable story, unlikeable characters, and nonsensical dialogue. The narrative starts out as a small party of mercenaries looking for a quest, but quickly turns into a cliché save-the-world tale, and my generic, trope-fitting adventurers consistently made out-of-character decisions that served only to stretch the story’s length. The voice acting is about as annoying as you’d expect 12-year-olds in pink armor to be. I almost lost my mind after hearing Tatyana shout her catchphrase “Dinner is served!” for the fiftieth time. Even the graphics are subpar and outdated. Though I liked the pleasing, cartoony design of the golems and lizardfolk, the game looks like it belongs on the PS2, not the PS4 I was playing it on. Natural Doctrine tries to be an unforgiving and brutal tactical RPG that punishes you for the tiniest mistake, and it most certainly does that. But it also punishes you for things outside your control, leading to frustrating, messy battles. Success comes down to luck rather than decisive strategy, robbing me of the sense of well-earned victory I yearn for. And with annoying characters, a dumb story, and outdated graphics, there’s not much that makes playing Natural Doctrine worth the stress.
Luke Reilly	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	 Beneath Driveclub’s bleeding-edge visuals and omnipresent social features lies a racer rooted in traditional, arcade racing tropes. The handling is easy to grasp, and the focus on fictional, predefined circuits and point-to-point courses in various locations across the world places it in a category separate from super-serious circuit-lappers like Gran Turismo 6 or any of today’s plentiful open-world racers. The result is a fast, fun, beautiful, and accessible racer, although its one that’s a little narrower than most of its modern peers.  Handling trends towards the arcade side of the spectrum, yet it’s considerably less superficial than something like Burnout. The 50 cars in Driveclub brake hard and grip like glue, but the driving model is still nuanced enough to let you feel the difference between a bulky Bentley Continental GT and an eager John Cooper Works-tuned Mini. It’s one-size-fits-all handling, though. In keeping with the overall arcade sensibilities, even with a bootful of throttle Driveclub’s high-horsepower hypercars spring from the line with only moderate wheelspin, and they seem mostly reluctant to about-face mid-corner in an orgy of oversteer. Even if the back end does step out it generally only takes a smidge of countersteering to correct it. I found it satisfying and entirely in line with Driveclub’s direction, even if it’s a fraction simplistic. The biggest problem I had with it is that the handling’s too sticky to make the drift events much fun; I generally found myself getting bogged down mid-corner because it’s surprisingly difficult to maintain momentum. Driveclub’s car selection is nicely curated to represent some of Europe’s most desirable sports cars, grand tourers, supercars and hypercars, plus a smattering of hot hatches as an entry point. They look absolutely remarkable. They’re best enjoyed from inside the cabins, where the attention to detail is so extreme that even the windscreens show those subtle semi-circle scuffs on the glass you get from the wipers when the glare of the sun catches them. Supercars like the Marussia B2 have fully functioning screens for their rear-facing cameras mounted in the centre console in lieu of a rear-view mirror, too, which developer Evolution captured exquisitely. Even little touches like the custom door-opening sequences, tailored to the configuration of the exterior and interior door handles, go a long way in making these rides feel real in a way racing games rarely manage. They sound exceptional too; Gran Turismo could learn a lot from this example. Driveclub looks amazing at night. It’s strange that the car list is so heavily biased towards European models, though; almost exclusively so, in fact. There’s actually only a single American car – the Hennessey Venom GT – and even that’s really just a Texas-built powerplant shipped over to the UK and manhandled into a modified Lotus Exige. More bafflingly, there are no Japanese cars at all. No doubt there’s some great stuff in Driveclub, including some properly amazing, lesser-known models that even the completely stacked Gran Turismo series is still omitting. But car lovers are nothing if not tribal, and this surprisingly insular day-one vehicle roster is going to rustle some jimmies. Performance upgrades and tuning aren’t featured, although visual customisation is. It’s not a completely freeform livery editor like the one found in the Forza series, however; it’s more like Grid Autosport, where you choose from a bunch of pre-set patterns, icons and numbers. I find all three distracting and garish;  flaming eight-balls look pretty daft on the side of anything. You can turn all these elements off if you want, or just race in a factory colour, but even in single-player races you’re still going to find yourself pitted against a bunch of dorky-looking lime-green AI Ferraris covered in more stickers than a child’s bicycle. Aside from our cars, we’re afforded some basic driver avatar customisation, too. There’s not a great deal more to it than there is in the likes of, say, PGR4 – choose a gender and select from a bunch of preset heads and shirts – but it feels like a sensible touch giving us some elementary control over what we look like behind the wheel, whether we stand up to pee or not. A simple but welcome option, like PGR4 and TDU before it. At any rate, while the garage is almost entirely Euro-centric for now, its racing locations are much less so. Tracks in Scotland and Norway are joined by routes across Canada, India, and Chile. As immaculately detailed as the cars are, I think Driveclub’s tracks are doubly breathtaking. Postcard-perfect trackside vistas stretch for miles, but they’re just as capable of standing up to close scrutiny, from the individual stones in the road surface to the barely perceptible wiggle of a tautly stretched corner flag. The attention to detail is truly admirable; check out the plastic bags and Driveclub pamphlets wafting across the roads, and the multi-coloured butterflies doing the same thing. The arcade nature has brought with it a forcefield of sorts that will ricochet you away from rocky verges, clumped snow, and protruding guard rails and prevents us from interacting much with anything beyond the asphalt. But stuff like this, combined with the incredibly realistic lighting, really helps make the tracks feel alive. Most of the routes are quite skinny too, which makes passing without contact a bit tricky but contributes to an excellent sense of speed. Driveclub features a few dedicated, fictional race circuits, though next to scenic blasts through sun-baked Indian scrubland and icy, Scandinavian tunnels, they feel quite boring. Driveclub nixes ugly racing lines for coloured corner flags that indicate their severity. Perhaps as a side-effect of the narrow roads, the racing can tend to be quite aggressive; AI cars have a habit of blitzing past you suddenly and at great speed, and more than once I was poleaxed out of contention with just a corner or two to go. There’s no mechanical damage, but there is a speed-retarding penalty system for harsh collisions. It doesn’t seem to apply to the AI, only to us, and it’s annoyingly inconsistent. Sometimes a slight tap when going two wide on a corner will trigger it, yet a massive shunt will go unnoticed. It’s irritating and caused me a few restarts, but thankfully wasn’t too common. A single-player progression system breaks up the racing with time trials and drift events. I quite enjoy the former; hotlapping against ghosts can become pretty compulsive. Of course, as with many of 2014’s big-ticket racers, connectivity is part of Driveclub’s key shtick – and it works well. Every track is populated with face-off challenges for us to try and beat in the process of racing or hotlapping: smash a friend’s (or stranger’s) average speed, drift score, or the like on a marked segment of track, and you’ll be rewarded with XP. Participate in (or create and share) custom challenge events, and you’ll be rewarded with XP based on your spot on the ladder when the challenge expires. I had a bunch of these challenges on the boil at a time, and by ranking decently I had a steady stream of XP accumulating even when I wasn’t playing. I really like this kind of asynchronous multiplayer; it’s much like the Forza series’ Rivals mode. Skilful driving also racks up XP; the spirit of PGR lives on in Driveclub. It’s a good thing these social challenges exist alongside the straightforward multiplayer racing, because it only takes a few days to mostly exhaust Driveclub’s single-player event slate, and that’ll leave you far short of unlocking all 50 cars. A clean and simple interface makes navigating to events and quickly jumping into challenges and pre-packaged multiplayer races extremely uncomplicated. Joining or creating an online race team of likeminded friends – your “club” – of between two and six players is important too. As rewards are shared among members, and also because five of Driveclub’s cars (including the mental BAC Mono) can only be unlocked by levelling up your club, being part of an active club is beneficial. You won’t be privy to all Driveclub offers playing as a so-called “Free Agent”. (You can’t have the name Pickleweasel, though, because I already took it.) Your individual achievements contribute to your club XP too, although as a part of a club you can also tackle the club-only challenges. They’re much like the individual challenges, and equally fun; each member can attempt the challenge, and the best club effort wins. However, Driveclub is overzealously protective of these precious cars: if you leave the club (or, as I discovered, play when the PSN is down), the cars are locked again. Driveclub is the best-looking racing game I’ve ever seen on a console, but down deep it’s a more modest, conventional arcade racer than the sprawling, open-world types we commonly see today. While it successfully creates fast and fun races with a great sense of speed, the overly aggressive AI grates, the difficult drifting seems at odds with the accessible handling, and the single-player loses zest once the solo content runs dry. I’m also surprised at how partisan the day-one car list is. That said, the tentacles of Driveclub can grip tight if you get invested in the game’s asynchronous challenges, and it’s very much geared around encouraging us to hop online and compete by making it so easy.
Steve Butts	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/01/skylanders-trap-team-review	 Redeeming villains as heroes often makes for some dramatic moments, and the way Skylanders Trap Team allows portal masters the chance to play as captured villains leads this year’s sequel down a path of righteousness. It adds even more variety to an already massively diverse platformer RPG. Even better, Trap Team reclaims some of the series’ better features, like Skystones and tilting lock puzzles, which were disappointingly absent from last year’s Swap Force. While the basic mechanics of this action platformer are solid, the characters have always been the best part of the Skylanders series, and Trap Team introduces some of the best heroes and villains yet. From a baby T-Rex with a helicopter backpack, to a candy-barfing Pinata and an Eastern-themed wind-master armed with a giant boomerang, Trap Team is full of inventiveness. The concept, design, and overall performance of the characters is a highpoint for the series. There are even new baby versions of series favorites like Spyro and Trigger Happy – sure, it’s a way to sell you more toys, but who doesn’t want one of these guys? Unfortunately, character progression suffers from an abundance of loot. Even playing as six entirely new characters, I had maxed out most of their upgrades a little over halfway through Trap Team’s 10-hour story, which meant I spend the second half with practically no use for tens of thousands of pieces of treasure. This would be less of a problem if there were new upgrade options for your existing Skylanders, but that Stealth Elf you’ve had for three years still won’t have any new ninja powers to spend her treasure on.  Players in co-op share treasure now, so there’s no reason to compete over it. It’s a small change, but it makes the two-player experience far less competitive and allows players of different skill levels to progress at the same pace with regard to upgrades. Unfortunately, the upgrade system still forces you to exit the upgrade interface after each individual purchase. That minor inconvenience adds up over time, and there’s a similar fussiness with swapping villains in and out of the traps. That said, playing as the villains is massively fun. Trap Team lets you play as over 40 villains, from a chef with a hot pepper for a head to a treasure chest with teeth. It’s particularly cool that some of the villains have abilities that are designed to be used in co-op. Broccoli Guy can drop healing glyphs, for instance, while Chill Bill can immobilize enemies with his freeze gun. Even in single-player, it’s easy enough to swap back and forth between these villains and use their support abilities. While the villains don’t get the same sort of upgrade options as the Skylanders themselves, each villain has his or her (or its) own redemption mission somewhere in the campaign. It’s a fun story moment to lead the villain through a specific challenge that brings them around to the side of the heroes, but none of the missions are co-op, which can be a bit of a snag if you’re playing with a friend. Even worse, some of the missions boil down to basically saying hello to another character. It feels like kind of a cheat.   As great as this rogues’ gallery is, the abundance of awesome villains contributes to some story problems. The Doom Raiders come at you one at a time, which gives the missions a sort of villain-of-the-week feel. You jump from bad guy to bad guy so quickly that the story never really seems to focus the way that it did around Kaos in the previous games. I was also a little annoyed that some of the villains are part of a new “mystery” element that Eon keeps saying he’ll explain but never does. My guess is that the mystery will be solved at retail soon enough. The villain missions are just one of the many diversions in Trap Team, but the bigger story here is the return of Skystones. The collectible card game is one of the best parts of 2012’s Skylanders Giants, but is annoying absent in Swap Force. Now it’s back in a more satisfying head-to-head design that plays more like Magic: The Gathering than Tic-Tac-Toe. There are far more, and far more interesting, tactical decisions to be made during a Trap Team match than there were in Giants as you match attack and defense values and special abilities against their opponent’s cards. Trap Team’s new lock puzzles are also much improved over those in Giants. Instead of the straight switches and paths, these puzzles return to the board-twisting mechanics from before. This time around, there are bumpers, breakable blocks, fire and water tiles, one-way doors, and other challenging elements that make the puzzles so much more satisfying and interesting. Sadly, not all the diversions are quite as successful. The platforming sequences are very shallow but their bigger fault is that many of the jump pads just aren’t built for co-op. The jump pads send characters flying off, but unless they hit the pad together, the game will try to teleport one character to the other. The problem is that it often does it in the middle of the jump, which creates even further separation between the characters and creates a sort of teleporting, jumping loop that it can take a few seconds to break. And the less said about the rap battles, the better. In most ways, Skylanders Trap Team is the best game in the series. The abundance of inventive and genuinely fun characters, and the inclusion of playable villains, means there’s always some amazing new trick to try. The new versions of Skystones and tilting lock puzzles are fun enough that I’d play them by themselves. On the downside, there’s nothing new here for your existing Skylanders, and the overall story just fails to come together. Still, where else are you going to see a Broccoli wizard to fight a heavy-metal werewolf?
Chuck Osborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	 As far as games go, famed detective Sherlock Holmes has never looked or played better than he does in Sherlock Holmes: Crimes and Punishments. The latest in developer Frogwares’ adventure series uses Unreal Engine 3 for a much-needed graphics upgrade. The more disappointing news is that Holmes’ final deductions are based largely on a web of circumstantial evidence.  Crimes and Punishments takes place over the course of six perplexing, well-written cases that give Holmes ample opportunities to do what Holmes does best: Snoop around crime scenes for clues, interrogate suspects, and talk down to just about everyone he meets. Murder is afoot in each of the cases, but that doesn’t stop them from being diverse; from a gruesome death by whaling harpoon to an Egyptian-style ritual killing, the plots had me riveted. And like a good winding mystery, the person who did it is rarely the one you suspect initially. My one criticism about the structure of these cases is that they’re all standalone stories, with nothing really linking them together except for the involvement of Holmes and his trusty chronicler, Dr. Watson. Holmes’ brother Mycroft, a British government official, shows up early on to foreshadow the concluding case, but otherwise the anthology just...ends. No overarching mystery, no grand denouement. Controlling Holmes from a third- or first-person perspective, discovering clues by searching crime scenes for evidence and questioning suspects is pretty easy and straightforward. Objects of interest are clearly marked by floating text boxes; some may require activating Holmes’ detective vision (similar to Batman’s in the Arkham series) which uncovers secrets that would go unnoticed by lesser sleuths. It’s a bit limited, since there are no secret areas or unlockables to uncover – but on the bright side, because detective vision didn’t need to be activated unless I was prompted to do so I didn’t waste time hunting for hidden clues that weren’t there. Some clues will require further research, such as consulting an archive of old newspapers and encyclopedias, while others may need to be tested in Holmes’ lab. Testing and picking locks present mini-puzzles that range from dreadfully easy to brutally difficult. A plus is that overly challenging puzzles can be skipped without penalty. While it’s easy to find clues, making the right sense of them can be another matter. Clues can be combined to make deductions, leading to the final deduction of the murderer’s identity. The problem here is that each case has more than one possible conclusion -- with only one being the “correct” one. Since many deductions are based on very circumstantial evidence (a rope was tied with a sailor’s knot, so a sailor must have been present!), there’s rarely a proverbial smoking gun that clearly points toward any one suspect. Like a game of Clue, several possible outcomes are plausible, but only the final conclusion screen reveals whether the right call was made. Luckily you can go back and replay the conclusion until you make the right selection...IF you’re able to combine the clues in the right way.  Conclusions also come with a moral choice: Should the suspect be arrested or absolved of their crime? From what I could see, there’s no reason for this feature to exist except to slightly alter the final cutscene; it doesn’t change the gameplay for future cases or alter how people interact with Holmes. It’s a mildly interesting inclusion, and I hope it’s fleshed out more in future installments, but the morality system is wasted here. Brief and, in relation to the rest of the gameplay, unexpected action sequences punctuate the climax of each case. Unfortunately, these sequences cannot be replayed; if a suspect commits suicide before you can shoot the gun from their hand, they’re dead permanently -- no backsies. On the plus side, these sequences showcase Sherlock’s boxing skills and Watson’s marksmanship, while also giving each story an extra rush of adrenaline and finality.  What really sets Crimes and Punishments apart from its predecessors, though, is its sparkling new look. It’s gorgeous on PS4 and PC; every character is rendered in rich detail -- so much so that you can see individual stubble and facial blemishes. It’s one of the most beautiful adventures I’ve played. Likewise, the voice acting is well done and pitch-perfect to Crimes’ style and time period. Crimes and Punishments offers a huge advance in graphics and gameplay for the Sherlock Holmes adventure series, and is well worth playing for longtime fans -- especially if they’re playing on a new-gen console or PC. The cases are thoroughly enjoyable, but deducing the murderer can be nebulous and unsatisfying due to a preponderance of circumstantial evidence.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/19/disney-infinity-20-marvel-super-heroes-review	 Last year’s Disney Infinity brought toys to life without ever forgetting the fun of playing with toys. In that version, it’s not unusual to find Mr. Incredible riding the Muppet mobile around Cinderella’s castle firing a toilet-paper gun. The core playsets, meanwhile, are great in a different way - they expose kids to a variety of gameplay experiences, from hack-and-slash combat to naval warfare, skateboarding, and stealth. For Disney Infinity 2.0, I expected a major advancement in gameplay on top of the addition of Marvel’s mightiest heroes to the party. The name certainly implies it. But while it brings some smart improvements and Toy Box mode continues to evolve and impress, elsewhere this sorta-sequel feels more like a downgrade.   Nowhere is this felt more keenly than in the story mode. The starter pack contains a single play set (a self-contained, structured adventure) based on The Avengers, and physical toys of Iron Man, Thor, and Black Widow. The toys look great – Infinity’s style continues to do a brilliant job of unifying all of its characters. But when I stopped playing with them and went to play with their in-game counterparts,I quickly missed the variety of having three distinct worlds, each with their own mechanics, to explore. Infinity 1.0 bundled Pirates of the Caribbean, Monsters University, and The Incredibles all into the starter pack, so 2.0’s starting point is noticeably less than expected. Marvel’s Universe is unquestionably rich enough to compensate, yet The Avengers set disappoints – it’s small, bland, and repetitive. On the bright side, the one advantage of having a single set is it allows co-operative play without the need to buy any additional toys. The plot centres on Loki invading Manhattan, unleashing an army of Frost Giants hellbent on bringing about a new ice age. And while the city certainly feels cold and lifeless, it has absolutely nothing to do with the ice slowly encrusting Stark Tower. Finishing the campaign took me somewhere between four and five hours, yet it felt much longer – not in a good way. Manhattan is such an integral part of Marvel’s universe, yet here it feels badly served. Parts of the city are off-limits – you can’t fly through Central Park, for example – and I couldn’t find the Baxter Building or the Daily Bugle. It never feels like Marvel’s Manhattan. It’s drab and lifeless; I’ve only played the PlayStation 4 version so far, and the environments lack detail and the cutscenes are rough around the edges.  The feeling of emptiness is compounded by the missions’ lack of variety. Invariably, they involve reaching a waypoint and pummelling wave after wave of Frost Giant. And that’s pretty much it for the duration. Variety manifests solely in the number and size of enemies you encounter; sometimes they have shields, sometimes spears, and now and then, if you’re lucky, you have to destroy weather machines or protect generators at the same time. The original Infinity sets encourage exploration by hiding new building items and collectibles, which would then rollover into creation mode, just out of reach. I also remember customising Jack Sparrow’s ship and rigging a variety of traps around Monster University’s campus. Those playful elements, which a year ago I thought central to the Disney Infinity experience, have mysteriously evaporated.   This is all the more frustrating since improvements have definitely been made to the characters and combat. Each character now possess a skill tree that allows players to unlock new abilities, so you can specialize them in ranged attacks, melee, healing, or speed. While the perks similar across character, each one is character appropriate: Iron Man fires missiles, Thor charge Mjolnir with lightning, and Black Widow accesses SHIELD’s secret cloaking technology. It adds variety but also helps make these characters feel more distinctive. Combat is another area that has received a lot of attention. There’s way more variety and the potential for real depth is present: characters possess counters, moves designed to break down an opponent’s defense, and special moves. But it never has the opportunity to shine; the control scheme just isn’t appropriate, as most of it is mapped to a single button, and there’s an absence of worthy, intelligent adversaries to unleash it upon. Even the climactic battle with Loki himself is indistinguishable from earlier encounters. But play sets are just one part of the Disney Infinity experience. Toy Box, where everything you collect and all your toys exist side-by-side, is a huge attraction. And strangely, it’s where Infinity really embraces the Marvel license with an enthusiasm that’s never evident in the play set. You can decorate your worlds with easter eggs and loads of Marvel paraphernalia; there’s everything from the Infinity Gauntlet to the Book of Vishanti. Having hundreds of items available to build with is always going to present problems, yet a redesigned interface and the ability to favourite particular items make building much more fluid.   It’s also much easier to get started in Toy Box than it is in 1.0. There’s a whole range of new tools which will randomly generate everything from terrain to cities and even race tracks. Tiny helpers can be tasked with building themed areas, such as pirate towns or tree houses. However, at the more complex end of Infinity’s creation suite are the Creativi-Toys – a series of logic gates that allow, in theory, more sophisticated experiences to be built. The number and variety of these has increased, yet the interactive tutorial has vanished. I found it really difficult to get to grips with these tools, and often found myself resorting to trial and error. Thankfully, the original’s eagerness to embrace different genres finds a home here in the form of Toy Box games – these are physical tokens, two of which come in the starter pack. ‘Escape from the Kyln’ is a top-down Gauntlet-like adventure, while ‘Assault on Asgard’ is an introduction to Tower Defense. It’s great this aspect of Disney Infinity lives on somewhere, but I would have loved to have seen these games directly inform the play set. I don’t want kids growing up thinking that all single-player campaigns involve escort missions, mindless button-mashing, and Frost Giants. Toy Box is still the place where Disney Infinity really shines. It’s where you’ll find Thor and Mike Wazowski can racing horses across the desert and Mickey Mouse and Iron Man paintballing in Halloween Town. Uneven and undercooked, Disney Infinity 2.0 isn’t the major upgrade I expected. It lacks the playful fun and diversity that made Infinity 1.0 so great last year. A few things are better – characters, old and new, feel more distinct and combat has been improved, and The Toy Box has made creation more inviting and less overwhelming. Disney Infinity 2.0 feels very much like a franchise that’s still finding its way, but I hope it doesn’t forget that what made it fun wasn’t the cool characters it had at its disposal but the way in which it played with them.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	" Hockey is my favorite sport. I played year-round throughout my childhood, and I watch it religiously (go Islanders!). One of the reasons I love hockey so much is because it's fast, strategic, and dynamic on so many different levels. The good news is that NHL 15 understands this. It's fun to play on a moment-to-moment level, and it's accessible to anyone that can hold a controller; should you want to delve into its finer points, there are complex techniques like poke checking, throwing your body around, and winning battles in the corners. The bad news is that on a big-picture level, NHL 15 foregoes and forgets much of the minutia that hardcore hockey fans really care about. For as solidly as it plays, some of the series' most important hooks - some of which inspired me to cheer it on in past years - have completely disappeared. On the ice, NHL 15 shines. But everything around it feels a tad bit empty. EA's NHL series typically totes strong gameplay, and it's as impressive as ever in NHL 15. Better yet, it's highly customizable. Camera angles can be altered, pre-determined difficulty settings can be tinkered with, and you can even set how arcadey or simulation-like you want the overall experience to be. Hate icing? Shut it off. Going offside the bane of your existence? Eliminate it completely. You can even determine how often a fight happens, the likelihood of a player breaking his stick, or whether you want to deal with injuries. And of course, you can pick your control style. It's cool that you can make something as meaningless as an exhibition game with your friend all your own by editing so many different facets, even if many of these options aren't exactly new. Speaking of modes, NHL 15 is noticeably lighter than old-gen iterations on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 (and, in fact, the old-gen version of NHL 15, which is a clone of last year's), and this is where the overall package begins to diminish. Online Team Play is gone, as is EA Sports Hockey League, which were two community lynchpins. You can still play single ranked or unranked games online -- everything goes very smoothly when connected, with reasonable load times and no noticeable lag -- and you can bring your Ultimate Team online, too. Hockey Ultimate Team is still enjoyable in its own right, with the ability to create unique squads with a hodgepodge of players from different teams, leagues, and skill levels. It might just be NHL 15's meatiest and most substantial option.  As a single-player-centric gamer myself, I've always gravitated towards offline modes, which is where the lack of content really started to sink in. NHL 15 doesn't even have a Season Mode, which was originally introduced in the Super Nintendo and SEGA Genesis era. To play a season, I had to actually jump into Be A GM Mode... only to find that  it’s been stripped of some of its own features, including basic online functionality. Be A GM Mode is actually awesome; I've enjoyed it in years past and it's always made me want a fully fleshed-out NHL game where you're a general manager. But it's really unfortunate that you have to extract Season Mode out of it instead of keeping them separate. I'm confused why I can't play a single season as a team of my choice without having to jump through hoops. It's 2014, not 1994. Be A Pro mode has also taken multiple hits. You can no longer be drafted by an organization and work your way up through the ranks from lesser, ancillary leagues and into the pros. Now, you're drafted by an organization and you immediately -- and mysteriously -- make the team. I created a pro that was drafted by the Montreal Canadiens. As I played, I was as confused as to why I couldn't skip forward to my next shift automatically as I was confused by how I -- a young rookie on the periphery of the roster -- could just jump on the ice whenever I wanted. Be A Pro still has deep customization options, but it also felt hollow and half-baked.  With all of that said, EA Sports has certainly created a pretty game, to the point where multiple people in the IGN office told me that from afar, they thought I was watching a real hockey game for a moment. Naturally, NHL 15 still suffers from some awkward animations and occasional glitchiness, but I was impressed by the relatively lifelike player faces and the flow of their sweaters. There are lots of little touches, from a center approaching the circle while looking behind him and chattering with his defensemen, to goal celebrations like jumping into the glass in the corner as teammates crowd around. Slow-mo replays of awesome goals are heightened by the realistic craziness of the crowd behind the glass. The crowd’s a bit more awkward at full speed, though. The camera often cuts to identical fans executing identical animations, and I've never seen so many ****-talking away-team fans in real life as I saw in NHL 15. I'm pretty sure a Senators fan wouldn't make it out of Toronto alive if he was taunting the home crowd like that. EA Sports has also nailed the sounds of hockey; the slash of a skate on fresh ice, the bounce of a puck into the boards, the collision of rubber on the crossbar. When I think about playing hockey, I think about the smell of the locker room, the sound of the Zamboni laying a fresh sheet down, and all of those aforementioned noises of the game. I'm so pleased that the telltale audio cues of hockey were captured so realistically, even if the crowd noise itself leaves something to be desired.  I also mostly enjoyed NHL 15's integration with NBC's hockey telecast. First of all, I'm a huge, huge fan of Doc Emrick. I think he's the best in the business. So hearing him, alongside Eddie Olczyk and ""Chicken Parm"" Ray Ferraro is a real treat. Still, Doc’s delivery feels a bit stilted. There are none of his quintessential freak-out moments, and his famously vast vocabulary isn't utilized well. Olczyk throws in a few memorable lines, but Ferraro's lines seem rushed. They also collectively seem off the mark fairly often. Doc will announce that a perfect pass just occurred as I threw a puck into traffic in the slot, losing it to an aggressive defenseman. A goalie can be scrambling in the crease, making multiple acrobatic saves, as Doc notes that those saves were ""easy."" Ferraro in particular seems off-kilter; he made comments multiple times during Be A GM Mode games that made it seem like I was in the 50th game of the season, not the 3rd. Little things like this are minor, but they can be grating if you're looking for immersion and realism. Likewise, using real video imagery of Doc and Eddie against fake, in-game footage was jarring. It was cool to hear that music, see the same scoreboard graphics, and witness the intros to each city, with helicopter shots of the arenas, skylines, and other geography. But slow-mo recaps of goals and other memorable moments are ruined by sharp edits between scenes that have the action stop for split seconds at a time. The most awkward recaps of them all are for fights, when you see that gloves are dropped by both players in literally one or two frames. These scenes in particular look so weird and unrealistic. NHL 15 is a tough game to size up. I truly do believe that gameplay is king, and it's there that NHL 15 shines brightly. It plays extremely well, whether online or offline, proving why EA Sports' long-running series has been the king of the ice for over 20 years. But there needs to be a reason to keep playing, and it's there that NHL 15 falls short and feels somewhat vacant. The jump to new-gen hardware has left behind a host of missing features and options that we had last year, and that's simply not acceptable. A barebones Practice Mode, no Season Mode, gutted GM Mode and Be A Pro Mode, no Winter Classic, and missing online features are just as easy to count as what's still there, and that's troubling. NHL 15 is a blast to play, but it doesn’t have the staying power I expect."
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	 While whizzing through the same level for the tenth time, trying to grab every rescue pod, and destroy every enemy while keeping the accelerator pinned, it dawned on me. Velocity 2X is the best Sonic game to come out in two decades. Much like the Blue Blur once did, Velocity 2X takes an established genre and injects it with equal parts speed and ingenuity. It skillfully uses its well-thought-out mechanics to lay out a clear path to mastery, and walking it gave me a near-constant sense of gratification.  Velocity 2X is both a vertically scrolling shmup and a side-scrolling action-platformer where you blow up nearly everything you can’t pick up, and speed is the highest virtue in the land. Like its predecessor, it disguises itself as a traditional vert-scroller, but once you’re tele-dashing into the heart of enemy formations and slinging smart bombs in every-which direction with the right stick, any feelings of familiarity will dissipate. Along with its near-constant focus on speed, these elements make Velocity 2X far more dynamic than your garden variety space shooter.  Velocity Ultra veterans will have an easy time slipping back into the cockpit of the Quarp Jet. Everything was right where I left it, as were the responsive controls. I hadn’t in any way expected the new on-foot side-scrolling sections to match that level of fluidity, but somehow, developer FuturLab did it. Thanks to the mirroring of key functions from the vertical sections, like boosting and tele-dashing, the platforming sections feel like solving a new set of problems with a pleasantly familiar box of tools. This makes the on-foot action feel like a natural extension of the space-shooting rather than an interruption of it. It also gives Velocity 2X a surprisingly coherent sense of place for an arcade shooter, a feeling reinforced visually by stark lines and notably improved lighting. Nearby explosions bathed my ship in a warm glow, and airlock walls pulsed with light as I gunned down swarms of enemy drones. On the whole, levels are laid out more intelligently than before, allowing for smoother, more rhythmic speed runs. There are still a few puzzle-based levels that focus on navigating branching paths of security locks, and, as in Velocity Ultra, they break up the ordinarily breezy pace of play in unpleasant ways. Where most of the level designs in Velocity 2X make impeccable use of your ship’s versatility and maneuverability, these ones amount to little more than tangled, incoherent knots that have you yanking at whatever strand looks the loosest until, somehow, it comes undone. It’s a structure that’s brought into the side-scrolling areas as well, requiring you to stop dead in your tracks and carefully toss a personal teleporter over obstructions in order to proceed. These brief moments of tedium are the only real stumbling points to be found though, and thankfully they’re few and far between. The new boss battles serve as effective “final exams,” keenly melding Velocity 2X’s various mechanics with a splash of bullet hell rather than making them like the giant damage-sponges you’d see in more traditional shmups. And while the 50 stages are noticeably easier to complete than those of Velocity Ultra’s, scoring a perfect rating is as much of a feat as ever.  Velocity 2X deftly balances action, platforming, and puzzle-solving, and it does so on a knife’s edge, at high speeds. Not only is it an outstanding Vita and PS4 game, but it’s the first game in a long time to give me the thrilling sense of mastery that a well-played level of Sonic the Hedgehog used to back in the 90s.
Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	 As stand-alone expansions go, Infamous: First Light has a lot going for it. It’s another four hours worth of the same superhero action that powers Infamous: Second Son, and its prequel plot adds some good backstory to the neon-powered speedster, Fetch. She’s a far more interesting and likable character than Delsin Rowe. The downside is that by putting us only in Fetch’s shoes, First Light limits us to just one of the four Second Son power sets. Super speed is a great power, and all the most important aspects, like endless speed, are unlocked from the get-go. The only thing is, it was a bit of a drag to spend about four hours with access to just one power set after playing with four as Delsin. Maybe that would’ve been less of an issue if Sucker Punch had come up with some really new and interesting stuff to do with the neon powers, but there’s not enough of that here. Fetch has a few new tricks, like running through swirly pink clouds placed on the streets and rooftops of Seattle for speed boosts – that makes running from point A to point B a little more entertaining, because we have small objectives to go for, and hitting one gives a sense of speed that makes Fetch's normal pace seem like a jog. There are some combat upgrades too, like neon homing missiles and melee finishers. They’re neat, but not a big deal – I had to go back and check to see if some of these were in Second Son because they didn’t really stand out. That, and none of the fights against gangsters in First Light stack up against the more spectacular battles to take out DUP Mobile Command Units in Second Son. Too many of these missions are repetitive sniper-mode shooting galleries, too. I do like how the story is framed as Augustine prodding Fetch to recall her emotional effort to save her brother in flashback sequences. Every few missions we’re brought back to the present, where Augustine puts Fetch through training missions. Those are plainly padding, because they’re just the new challenge maps presented in a story context. Not that I have anything against the three challenge maps, because they’re a great way to hone your powers and compete on leaderboards for high scores and unlock Trophies. Fighting as Fetch in the open world map is low-risk, because you can always just bail and heal if you get into trouble, but here you’re locked in with the enemies in a fight to the death. Staying alive is a good test of skill. If you own Second Son (and you should, before you play First Light) you can play the challenges as Delsin, too. Infamous: First Light is a decent story around a better character than Second Son, but its battles don’t have the same scale or superpower variety that Second Son’s do. After the short campaign, its challenge maps put a new spin on combat by taking away your ability to escape danger on a whim, making it much tougher.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	 It seems strange -- even counter-intuitive -- but as one of my history professors used to say, learning history is five percent memorizing dates, times, and other facts, and 95 percent interpreting what you actually think happened. It's hardly a science. That's why CounterSpy, a PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita side-scrolling espionage game from developer Dynamighty hit home with me, at least when it comes to its bold subject matter. It makes no biased judgments, and it chooses no winners and losers. The real threat of nuclear war was perpetually scary, yet CounterSpy makes light of the era in unique ways by focusing on the Cold War's overall absurdity. CounterSpy may take place during the heart of the Cold War, but unlike most historical fiction written by the victors, it hates both sides equally. It refuses to even call the opposing nations by their actual names. Instead, the Americans are the Imperialists and the Soviets are the Socialists. This is a not-so-subtle ode to the way the two sides thought about one another, and it's an ingenious way to reduce decades-long smoldering into tight caricatures. Slinking through the desert. This approach is taken to its zenith by forcing us into a third, unforeseen party known as C.O.U.N.T.E.R. Cleverly, this shadowy organization allies itself with neither side. Instead, its goal is what (in hindsight) any reasonable person should’ve been doing during that time: sabotaging the Imperialists' and Socialists' nuclear programs before they inevitably destroy each other (and the entire planet). CounterSpy does a great job of nailing the look and sound of its setting, at least in terms of how those of us who didn’t live through it think it all looked and sounded. Heavily inspired by the likes of James Bond and countless other Cold War-esque novels, comics, movies, and TV shows, its art and sound direction are its strongest points, especially because of how much they contribute to giving CounterSpy a real feeling of place and time. Less powerful -- though still fun -- is its gameplay. In this regard, this side-scroller seems to have been most influenced by the Metroidvania school of design, though its take is heavily reductive. Instead of giving us sprawling complexes to explore for hours, CounterSpy opts to provide bite-sized mini-maps that can be completed in 10 or 15 minutes each. (The entire experience shouldn't take more than three or four hours to complete.) Each stage is procedurally generated -- a nice touch considering you'll be playing on these otherwise-tiny maps over and over again -- and each level is littered with collectibles to find, including all-important Launch Plans you need in order to shut down both sides’ nukes. This approach is brilliantly heightened by CounterSpy’s procedural nature, and how both sides' complexes change on the fly to give you different experiences. For instance, one foray through an Imperialist base might net you three Launch Plans (if you can find them, that is), as well as some weapons blueprints and some cash. But if you opt to go after the Socialists instead, you may get a ton of money, a weapons blueprint, some skill formulas... and only a single Launch Plan. Shhhh! Balancing these two conflicting goals -- making your character stronger or forcing your way to the endgame -- isn’t necessarily essential in CounterSpy, because you can actually have it both ways, or simply go in one direction or the other. This choice isn't at the core of what makes CounterSpy tick, but it's there, and it's a nice touch. Unfortunately, the more you play through these procedurally generated maps, the more CounterSpy's sometimes glaring problems come to the forefront and test your patience. CounterSpy's special gameplay hook is its ever-changing perspectives. It's a side-scroller until you pop into cover, at which point your perspective will shift to an over-the-shoulder perspective, showing you terrain that you couldn’t see from the side. This is a really lovely idea that, for the most part, works well, but CounterSpy's controls can be awfully finicky. Aiming can be a bit of a chore, especially since you can't reveal yourself to enemy soldiers for very long or you'll be seen. I found myself, at times, in obnoxious control loops as I tried to come into and out of cover or attempted to engage in some heated firefights, which are never as fun as simply sneaking around. In short, gunplay could certainly be better. It's not broken -- or even bad -- but it's not nearly as tight and responsive as I would have liked, regardless of which weapon is being used. (If you're curious, the silenced Diplomatic Pistol was typically my go-to, as it was nice and quiet, allowing me to pop some enemy heads without anyone hearing blasts.) Speaking of the Diplomatic Pistol, I was a fan of not only CounterSpy's set of weapons and skills, but of working my way through various environments to find them. Concocting full blueprints and formulas from disparate parts made me feel like I was accomplishing something special in a sort of metagame, and it gave me a real sensation of power when I could equip better weapons and more useful skills. Destruction. Unfortunately, having to go back to maps over and over again, especially when things ramped up in difficulty near the end, exposed CounterSpy's frustratingly inconsistent AI. I was puzzled as to why sometimes enemies spotted me and other times they didn't, especially when I was basically doing the same moves over and over again. There was no predictability to the experience, which caused its fair share of annoyances. This is an issue for a stealth game. What's most frustrating about these AI problems is that it conflicts with an otherwise brilliant mechanic in CounterSpy, which revolves around its DEFCON meter. This meter, which ranges from one to five, is affixed to the individual sides, and goes up or down depending on how stealthily and successfully you've worked your way through previous stages. I absolutely adored this idea, because it gave weight and consequence to how you did previously, and it could make or break how you'd be doing in the present. But with so much of it contingent on occasionally finicky controls and inconsistent AI, keeping your DEFCON counter in check required more patience than skill. And that bummed me out. CounterSpy is a good game with its heart in the right place. Its Cold War premise is brilliant, its art is beautiful, and its music is lovely. When it comes to gameplay, the stealth action sputters a bit in its inconsistent AI and inaccurate aiming, but it still delivers a fun experience. Cross-buy and cross-save between PS4, PS3, and Vita is a great bonus, but it's worth noting that the Vita version’s load times are noticeably long, and the framerate on the handheld can be less than desirable.
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/hohokum-review	 The carnival is in full swing: the Ferris wheel is packed and spinning madly, while elsewhere party goers are bouncing atop umbrellas and staring at their warped reflections in fun-house mirrors. All that’s missing is one final piece from the rollercoaster. It’s currently zooming happily along its tracks, but the single gap in its carriages cries out to be filled. I cruise through the air, soaring and circling, looking for something, anything, I’ve missed in this flat-shaded fever dream. Hitchhikers hop onto my back as I surf the skies. So far I’ve dropped them all over this world – into Ferris wheel carousels, onto see-saws and atop plinths. I’ve even scooped them back up as they drift slowly down, umbrella in hand, after being spat out of the curious vacuum-like machines hovering in mid-air. This is a world with its own often-opaque internal logic, and I’m momentarily stuck as I try to decipher it. The electric fences! That has to be it. I glide up near the towers, back to an area I‘d been avoiding after accidentally frying my precious carnival-going cargo and watching blackened corpses fall from the sky. I realise that the electric shock from flying into one of the electric fences lasts just long enough to illuminate a nearby string of lanterns. I methodically move from lantern chain to lantern chain, and when they’re all lit, the final piece of the rollercoaster makes its appearance. I carry it back down to complete the carriage, and my reward is a creature much like myself – a space-worm-thing - who proceeds to shadow me around this strange, vibrant and colourful carnival. I want to go to there. Intrigued? You should be. Hohokum is one of the year’s most refreshing experiences. This cross-buy, cross-save PS3, PS4 and Vita title blurs the line between game and interactive art, and there is most assuredly nothing else like it. The area described above is just one of many, and they run the gamut from entirely abstract spaces through to very distinct places: windows into fascinating – and wonderfully creative – little worlds. Over the course of Hohokum you’ll carry a man and his lantern through a pitch-black cave complex, shattering jewel-encrusted treasures lurking in the darkness before depositing him into a snug-looking living room. You’ll clear a path for a jellyfish-like mermaid between a series of pulsing watery globes and discover the joys of swimming with schools of hyperactive fish. You’ll even attend a wedding, picking out the bride or groom, then scooping drinks out of an undulating scarlet sea to serve to all the guests. Lois in the sky with diamonds. And throughout it all, you’ll have only a tenuous idea of what’s going on and what you’re supposed to be doing. In a structural sense, there are literal eyes hidden throughout each level to be opened (you can see how many there are to find on the pause menu) and each main area has a creature like yourself – unlocked with discordant fanfare – to discover. They’re linked to activities that sometimes feel like puzzles, but are better described as play – you’re really just looking for things to interact with and seeing what will happen. And what generally happens is magical. One minute you’re helping the inhabitants of wind-swept mountain tops fly their kites, the next you’re harvesting colour swatches to feed into a hat-making machine. Even attempting to describe this game is madness.  Hohokum is very much a game to play with an open mind and a relaxed attitude. This is not a title that’s about deep mechanics or clever puzzles: it’s a playground to be explored and experienced... and even to get lost within, as navigating between its many interconnected spaces can be quite convoluted. You will have only a hazy sense of purpose; the real goal is to simply delight in interaction. Cause and unexpected effect. To that end, Hohokum is a huge success. Yes, it’s deliberately obtuse – you won’t always know when there are ‘puzzles’ and when things should be taken at face value, and yes, the loading times could be improved – as could the frame rate, which hitches occasionally - but it’s also overflowing with personality and a steady stream of delightful surprises. And it's as wonderful on Vita as it is on PS3 and PS4 - just make sure you have a good pair of headphones to get the most out of the fantastic soundtrack. This sequence is particularly surreal. Two words: magic beans. Hohokum is one of those games that could only have been created by a small team, so distinct are the voices within the presentation and design. Artist Richard Hogg, in particular, deserves high praise. Every environment is striking yet distinct, and layered with expressive animations and flourishes. Hohokum is less playable while zoomed in, but you’ll want to do so anyway, just to catch the little touches – the hitchhikers raising their umbrellas when you pass through a waterfall, or the frenzied dancing at the conclusion of the wedding, as fireworks light the night sky. Hohokum is the latest title in a long lineage of artistically inclined, thoroughly unique PlayStation exclusives. From Vib Ribbon through to LocoRoco, Flower, Tokyo Jungle, Sound Shapes and more, it’s in good company, and deserves to be uttered in the same breath as those much-loved cult classics.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/28/the-last-of-us-remastered-review	" Let's just cut to the chase, shall we? I'm happy to report that Naughty Dog has successfully brought PlayStation 3's single best game -- The Last of Us -- to PlayStation 4 in the form of The Last of Us: Remastered. (You can read my full review of 2013’s The Last of Us on PS3 here.) It’s as much a masterpiece on PS4 as it is on PS3, and it’s worth your undivided attention whether you’ve played it already or are about to jump in for the first time. Sure, we may not have really needed a port so quickly, but then again, The Last of Us isn’t just any game. As one of the best games of all-time, the more places it is and the more people that can play it, the better.  The biggest change Remastered brings is its framerate. The original version of The Last of Us pushed the PlayStation 3 to its absolute limits to pull off 30 frames per second at 720p resolution, but the PlayStation 4 runs Remastered at 60 frames per second and 1080p resolution. It’s a jarring change at first, but one that I began to appreciate the more I played. If you don’t agree, Naughty Dog has included the option to lock the framerate to the original 30, but it was flipping back and forth that made me really begin to see the contrast. It’s hard to explain how much of a difference the 30-to-60 transition makes until you see it for yourself; the PS3 original frankly looks a bit choppy by comparison. Doubling the framerate doesn’t only provide an obvious aesthetic boost; it enhances gameplay, too. The most hardcore competitive shooters on consoles – like the Call of Duty series – run at or near 60 frames because it makes the shooting that much more fluid, responsive, and accurate. You’ll see similar effects in The Last of Us: Remastered during gun battles, even if they are (or should be) few and far between. (Remember: this is largely, though not entirely, a stealth game.) The PlayStation 4’s extra horsepower also gives a boost to The Last of Us’ graphical fidelity. Now, I know that’s not necessarily saying a whole lot, considering The Last of Us on PS3 is already the most beautiful game I’ve seen on any console. But somehow, Remastered looks just a bit better. Textures are more detailed, the lighting is enhanced, and everything pops more.  The changes aren’t mind altering – or even game changing – but you can absolutely see the difference. From the moment I started the campaign, I couldn’t help but notice improvements everywhere. Some are far more minor than others, but they’re there, and they make The Last of Us burst with even more life. You can really soak the beauty in with Remastered’s new Photo Mode, which allows you to take control of the camera, alter visual settings like focus and filters, and more to grab the most gorgeous shots possible. It’s not uncommon to encounter stunning sights in The Last of Us – like when you first enter environments reclaimed by nature with Joel and Tess near the beginning of the game – and now, you can capture those moments for posterity, if you’d like.  Another notable change from PS3 to PS4 is, as you might expect, the controller. Naughty Dog knew the weaknesses of the DualShock 3’s terrible triggers, which explains why aiming and shooting was unconventionally mapped to R1 and L1. DualShock 4’s far superior triggers don’t suffer from a similar problem, so you can map shooting to R2 and L2 if you want, or keep it as it originally was. Your backpack menu can be brought up with the DualShock 4’s meaty center button, too. And, like Killzone: Shadow Fall, the controller’s speaker can be used to play audio diaries and sound effects like the on/off click of your flashlight, though you can turn this off if you find it too obnoxious. For as great as Remastered’s little tweaks and additions are, the true value proposition comes in when you start to talk about DLC. A slew of DLC that had to be purchased separately on PlayStation 3 comes bundled-in on PlayStation 4. For instance, Left Behind – The Last of Us’ incredible single-player prequel DLC – is included (read the original review here), as are a ton of online maps and modes that you’d otherwise have to acquire separately on PS3.  And yes, playing The Last of Us: Remastered online is just as awesome as it was the first time around, again aided by a silky-smooth framerate. I suspect the surprising online addiction The Last of Us provided in 2013 will be renewed for some and discovered for the first time for others. In 2013, I called The Last of Us on PlayStation 3 a masterpiece. The same holds true of its PlayStation 4 ""Remastered"" sibling. You can’t go wrong with either version, but with Remastered you’ll get a better framerate that smooths out gunplay, a prettier, sharper look, and a bunch of DLC content rolled into the package from the get-go (not to mention a whole fresh set of Trophies to earn again, if you have a whole lot of time on your hands). Whether you’ve already experienced it on PlayStation 3 or have no idea what you’re missing, The Last of Us: Remastered is worth your time and attention. PlayStation 3’s best game just became PlayStation 4’s, too."
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	" As beloved as it is, certain aspects of Oddworld: Abe's Oddysee have aged about as well as a wet mummy. Clunky controls, unadjustable harsh difficulty, and graphics that are hideous when scaled up to HD resolutions mean high barriers to entry for newcomers, which make it harder to discover one of the most memorably imaginative games of the late '90s. Thankfully, it's a lot easier in Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty. Rebuilding Oddysee from scratch, New 'n' Tasty modernizes the original's gameplay and art while leaving its level layout and design largely untouched. The end result is a smoother, more vivid, and much more immediately fun retelling of the excellent first Oddworld story. A brilliantly weird side-scrolling adventure, New 'n' Tasty focuses on Abe, a puny, bumbling alien out to escape the sinister factory farm where he and his fellow Mudokons are enslaved. Because Abe is relatively defenseless and weak, this involves dodging a lot of spinning blades and explosive traps (something that requires careful timing and observation), sneaking past threats, and – if there's no security hardware nearby to prevent it – mind-controlling guards. That last one is cathartically violent, letting you remotely walk your enemies into mines, or wipe out their friends (or your friends, if you're feeling mean) with gunfire before making your host explode in gruesome chunks. Getting through the assorted hazards is tough enough on its own, but you also have a secondary task to consider: rescuing other Mudokons by leading them safely past danger and into magical portals. You're free to ignore them and simply blast through the central challenges, in which case you'll get a shorter experience and a downer ending. Alternatively you can work to save them all, which involves discovering and exploring a lot of trap-filled secret rooms, which is a lot more rewarding. (Pure speed runs are also encouraged). In either case, leading them to freedom is a lot less frustrating than it used to be, now that you can command groups of them to follow you – and sneak, run, or hide – at once. That's just one of the changes New 'n' Tasty makes; levels are now seamlessly scrolling environments, giving them a more open, cohesive feel than Oddysee's single-screen puzzle rooms. You can now aim thrown objects with the right analog stick instead of simply tapping a button and hoping they find their targets, and Abe has a new, endless supply of bottlecaps you can toss around to briefly distract enemies and kill annoying bats. And while Abe still has a noticeable weight and momentum that make jumping or rolling between tightly spaced traps an imprecise bastard, the controls for doing so are a lot more responsive.  The biggest change – and possibly the most controversial – is ""Quiksave,"" which lets you instantly save your location and progress just by tapping the Dual Shock 4's touchpad, and reload by holding it down. This doesn't quite eliminate frustration – you'll probably still die pretty frequently – but it cuts down on it immensely, as you can now save just before trying something risky, or after each stage of a particularly tough challenge. I found it indispensable – hey, not everyone likes retracing all their steps from the last checkpoint when every mistake brings instant death – but it's easy to see hardcore fans crying foul, especially since there isn't a way to turn Quiksave off. Couple that with rebalanced checkpoints, a gentler difficulty curve, and new camera angles (which reveal threats in advance and offer more visual clues about secret areas), and New 'n Tasty simply isn't as tough as the original, even on hard difficulty. However, the point here isn't so much to provide a brutal challenge as an enjoyable one – and New 'n' Tasty is definitely enjoyable. Its re-imaginings of RuptureFarms and the surrounding wilderness are hugely fun to puzzle through, delivering a continual stream of diverse new challenges, and certain sequences – like charging across cliffs on the back of Abe's hooting Elum, or rolling a giant spiked ball into a swarm of spidery Paramites – are much more exhilarating now that the scenery actually scrolls.  It all looks amazing, too. Everything, from Abe's giant talking head on the title screen, to the suspiciously helpful signs posted throughout the backgrounds, has been lavishly redrawn and re-animated, giving Oddworld a new, more vibrant appearance. And it's accompanied by a wealth of newly recorded dialogue for Abe, his fellow Mudokons, and the creepy Slig guards, giving them even more personality than they had before. This is a top-flight production, and while it would have been nice to see a few more additions – like, say, an actual co-op mode instead of an alternating two-player option that’s misleadingly labeled as co-op – New 'n' Tasty is a fine return to form for a wonderfully strange classic. Oddworld: New 'n' Tasty is a beautiful remake that irons out nearly all of the problems and limitations of 1997’s Abe's Oddysee while bringing its best qualities to the fore. This ground-up remake looks and feels fresh enough to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with any modern 2D platformer — evidence that Abe's Oddysee really was ahead of its time."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/17/crimsonland-review	 Crimsonland may be one of the most literal names ever given to a game. In 10tons' top-down shooter -- which originally came to PC way back in 2003 -- you're charged with eliminating seemingly endless waves of aggressive enemies, painting the landscape red with blood in the process. The result is an arcadey experience that's admittedly repetitive, but strangely (and deeply) addictive. It hits the same note over and over again, but it's not a note you'll necessarily tire of hearing. For PlayStation fans, the most obvious analog for Crimsonland is Dead Nation, and while Crimsonland isn't as good -- it lacks the story, atmosphere, and grit of Housemarque's shooter -- it's arguably more grueling. It’s graphically modest, to put it kindly. You won't have much to learn or memorize by way of controls, but that's the idea; the entirety of the action is controlled using the analog sticks to move and the R2 button to shoot. You can't run (without a short-lasting power-up) and you can't toggle between firearms. Crimsonland is all about challenging you to raise your skill level with the tools at hand, whatever they may be. It's not pretty to look at or listen to; it's just fun to play.  The bulk of Crimsonland can be found in its 60-stage campaign, a litany of stages that are repetitive, but not mindlessly so. Cruising through each almost identical-looking level -- which could take anywhere from 30 seconds to a few minutes each -- teaches you the finer points of Crimsonland's brutal risk and reward-centric combat, which can in turn be parlayed into its many score-based challenges. Better yet, at the end of each level, you'll unlock a new perk or weapon that can be used while chasing high scores on the leaderboards. You might want to jump right to the leaderboards from the word go, but that'd be a mistake; everything you need to learn and earn rests in a campaign that you'd be foolish to ignore. This is awesome, since there's a reason to play everything. The weapons and perks are greatly varied, and you'll definitely find a few of each that you prefer as you play. There's not a lot of balance between items in your arsenal -- some firearms are straight-up better than others, especially those with spreadshot -- but the perks definitely cater to specific styles of play. Some perks can make you quicker, or regenerate your health, or make your weapons stronger. Others can sacrifice your energy (or even your life outright) in order to gain a one-time bonus, like an instant add-on to your final score. I love how versatile the weapons and perks are, even if the latter can only be used outside of the campaign. What's so intriguing about the campaign -- and, in turn, the other modes that surround it -- is how dynamic such a simple premise with equally simple controls can be. At first glance, its emphasis on random item drops -- and the fact that you start out each level with the weakest weapon and get only what enemies leave behind -- Crimsonland may seem entirely luck-based. There's definitely an element of luck to be had here; if you don't get the right weapon for a specific stage, or some well-timed drops to help you out in a pinch, you'll likely fail. But Crimsonland requires skill, too. Lots of it. Learning when to risk yourself to detonate a nuke or grab a shield, or to swap your weapon for a new drop are essential decisions for success, and taking those risks keeps me on the edge of my seat. Living to tell the tale after taking a risk or barely surviving an onslaught makes Crimsonland exciting, and makes me want to keep playing, even if I’m doing the same thing over and over again. Blood, blood everywhere. Crimsonland's real hook is its Survival Mode, however. It’s really five modes put into one, using the same limited array of enemies from the campaign. Survival itself is joined by Rush, Weapon Picker, Nukefism, and Blitz, but all of them are throw-away except for Survival itself. Using perks and knowledge you earned in the campaign, you're unleashed upon a static map where endless waves of enemies will assault you. Survival -- like similar modes in the aforementioned Dead Nation and Resogun -- is a huge hook. Trying to up your high score to compete with friends and the anonymous masses on the leaderboards is truly addictive, though it doesn't have the longevity or the level of polish of Housemarque's games. Interestingly, you can play the campaign and Survival with up to four players, though only local play is supported. Sitting down with a friend (or two, or three) certainly makes things far more manageable, but it's disappointing that you can't jump on the PlayStation Network and play with someone there, too. There's simply no excuse for local-only multiplayer in 2014. Period. I really like Crimsonland. It's unpretentious and straight-forward in its delivery, and yet, underneath its façade rests an addictive top-down shooter with solid mechanics and a hardcore slant. Crimsonland isn't entirely skill-based -- luck does play a part, for sure -- but old-fashioned reflexes and decision making still make up a vast majority of the equation. With single-player and multiplayer options, a repetitive (yet satisfying campaign) score-chasing modes, and 21 Trophies to earn, Crimsonland is, at the very least, a good game to spend a long weekend with.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	 I know there are going to be people who strongly disagree with this statement, but I'll come out and say it right off the bat: Another World -- which you may also know as Out of This World -- is a bad game. Sure, it has a pretty and unique minimalist art style, which is especially impressive considering Another World’s roots on the early-'90s PCs Amiga system, and it works within that era’s graphical limitations. It has a fairly compelling story, too, one that's cleverly delivered without a single word written or spoken. But as a game, one that you play? Another World is anything but good. It reminds me a great deal of how I feel about Dragon's Lair: it's an old, well-remembered game that simply isn't fun. So what's the point of playing it instead of watching a Let’s Play? Another World puts you in the role of Lester, a scientist conducting obviously hazardous experiments in his laboratory. One thing leads to another, and he finds himself stranded on a mysterious planet populated by more enemies than friends. Undeniably beautiful. The mysteriousness and ambiance of the alien planet is perhaps the single best aspect of Another World. I really enjoyed how it let me know exactly what was going on without having to actually tell me, and how it leaves things open to interpretation. Scenic queues, audible grunts, and more are a far cry from cutscenes that pull you out of the experience. Another World feels quaint, but this represents the whole of its charm, because none of its delivery is literal. Unfortunately, that charm falls prey to complete frustration literally 30 seconds into the adventure -- and about every 30 seconds thereafter -- when you have to figure out how to use a stiff, rigid, and completely unacceptable control scheme that makes Another World arbitrarily harder than it should be. To be clear, this is not the effect of a botched port; all versions of Another World have this issue. There is nothing worse in games -- and I mean nothing -- than oppressively bad controls. I don't care how good it looks or sounds, and I don't care about how endearing its story is. These are additive qualities. If it's not fun to actually play, what's the point? Another World isn't fun. That's a huge problem. Sometimes you'll want Lester to run, and you'll press that button. Maybe he'll run, maybe he won't. Maybe he'll jump, maybe he won't. Sometimes you'll want Lester to shoot his laser gun, or create a shield, or blast off a powerful shot. It's a crapshoot whether he'll actually do any of that when you tell him to. This creates incredible frustration, especially in Another World's gun battles, which come off as utterly capricious and overly punitive. This isn’t about being too hard; the NES Mega Man games are amongst my favorite games of all time, and they're notoriously difficult. But they're difficult through design. Their controls feel great, and that means that when I die, it's no one’s fault but my own. I can't say the same about Another World. Hey yourself. Still, I can't deny the feeling of accomplishment I got when I worked my way through a stubborn and annoying part of Another World, which is basically every single part of it. I admitted defeat and gave up trying to figure things out on my own early -- lest I throw my Vita out of the nearest window -- and called up a video walkthrough to guide me. But even then, it only dulled the pain. Another World's puzzle design isn't nearly as bad as its controls, but that doesn't necessarily make that design good. And perhaps it's that obtuseness that really is at the core of what makes Another World a bad game. There's nothing inherently wrong with not knowing what to do; in fact, the mystery of an experience and not necessarily knowing what your goals are can be a big part of what makes playing video games -- like reading books or watching movies -- amazing. But when you're expected to interact with something, unlike those books or movies, there has to be a hook. You have to at least feel like you're in control, and that your character will do what you want to him or her to do. Lester walks around like a bag of cement, he shoots his laser gun with no consistency, and he jumps like a 1,000-pound man. Where's the fun in any of that? If your game lacks good controls -- like Telltale’s The Walking Dead, for instance -- you had better deliver the goods elsewhere. Even if Another World is pretty and tells an interesting and different kind of story, that's simply not good enough in this case. Go back and play Super Mario Bros. on NES. That's a timeless game. Another World is, for many, a timeless memory, but I'm sad to report that a good game it is not. I was excited about Another World: 20th Anniversary Edition. In fact, I volunteered to review it, because I’d heard so many good things about it from friends, and I admire its intriguing look and mysterious alien ambiance. And yet it took me about five minutes to realize that Another World is best left in their fond memories. I honestly couldn't fathom recommending Another World to anyone. I could rattle off a hundred platformers with better controls off the top of my head -- puzzle-oriented or otherwise -- that you should play before you subject yourself to these terrible controls and uninspired platforming puzzles.
Leah B. Jackson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/mousecraft-review	 Vigorously working my brain to save a troupe of adorable, Lemming-like mice from MouseCraft’s series of deadly traps made me feel a bit like a rodent in a maze myself. Placing Tetris-like bricks to guide them (well, at least one of them) over a growing list of hazards like acid, electricity, and explosives was about five hours worth of consistently tough and interesting puzzling challenges that only occasionally hit a frustrating wall. The early puzzles of MouseCraft do a nice job of introducing you to using Tetriminoes to guide up to three slow-moving mice through 2D stages to a delicious block of cheese. You get a set amount of specific pieces to use per level, making it important to rotate and place them properly so your mice can get where you want them to go. The mice walk single-mindedly from left to right on their own (much like Lemmings) and can only jump up one brick at a time, so building a path for them to reach the cheese can take some doing.   Puzzles, or experiments, ramp up in difficulty quickly, and soon had me working hard. Unfortunately, there aren't any hints in MouseCraft to help get you unstuck, and after retrying one level over two dozen times, even a small tip would have been welcome. Even though it looks cartoony, this isn’t a game young children should be expected to get through without help – which may be a good thing. The bright style of MouseCraft is eyecatching, but there isn’t much personality to be found in this vibrant science lab. While cute, the mice don’t do much of anything other than walk towards cheese and smile when they get there. I did feel a bit guilty whenever they fell into a pool of electrocuted water and their little ghost-mouse bodies floated away though. Sorry, little guy! The biggest missed opportunity is that the mad scientist character, Schrödinger the cat, simply watches from the background as you guide the mice through each experiment. He’s fun in cutscenes, but doesn’t add anything other than something to look at in the background of each stage. Even when the backgrounds of a level change, he always stays the same. To keep the experiments interesting, every so often you'll uncover new hazards, like water or acid, along with new types of bricks to help you overcome them. There are seven brick types in all, and the rate at which you're introduced to new mechanics is satisfying enough. I never felt overwhelmed with what I was working with. I also like how the different bricks vary in how they interact with certain hazards, giving puzzles an extra layer of complexity and requiring more precise timing. A normal brick disintegrates in acid, for example, whereas an Indestructible Brick doesn't. The Crumbling Brick, meanwhile, vanishes after two mice walk over it.   This is where MouseCraft's time-freeze feature is fantastically helpful. Any time you need to meticulously place a brick and don't want any mice to get in your way, or if you want to stop them from moving up to or past a certain area, you can stop time and noodle your way to a solution. Conversely, the nifty speed-up-time option was useful for when I knew I’d solved a puzzle correctly and wanted to the mice to quickly reach their prize. Unlimited undos are nice too, as I never felt too much pressure when experimenting with brick placement. Along the way to the cheesy goodness, you also have to position bricks to guide your mice through glowing blue shards in every level, which unlock access to later levels. Gathering them all adds an additional challenge, as they're often completely out of the way of the cheese. But a problem arose when I decided to skip some shards and go straight for the goal in a few puzzles, because I hit a point where I needed 20 more to proceed. In theory that’s fine, because you can freely go back and replay a level to pick up shards you’ve missed… but there's no way of telling how many remain in each of the 80 levels. I had to guess which levels to replay, which was a frustrating and time-consuming roadblock.   On the other hand, going back to collect missing shards does add some replayability to MouseCraft, as does its level editor. I had fun creating a few tough puzzles for my friends using all the different bricks and hazards. While it’s available on both PC and all the PlayStation systems, you currently can’t share them online on the PlayStation versions - just with your friends on the couch. On PC, I was a little annoyed I couldn’t change the keybinds. The frequently used E button releases the mice and speeds up time, and it’s right next to the R button, which entirely resets a level and erases all your efforts. Having to redo everything because I pressed the wrong button stank as much as the cheese at the end of each level. MouseCraft is a thoughtful puzzle game with challenging levels and some clever features. While customizable controls and a little more information on the level-select screen would have removed some significant annoyances, the overall enjoyment of easily being able to drop in to any level (including some I made myself) and guide my mice to their prize is good fun.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/30/blue-estate-review	 Some pieces of entertainment cross lines of decency with purpose and wit in an attempt to challenge or educate us. Many others cross those lines unknowingly, out of ignorance rather than malice. But Blue Estate vaults over these lines knowingly, willfully, and for seemingly no reason but to wallow in adolescent squalor. Its many failed attempts at humor make its bog-standard rail-shooter gameplay all the more unbearable, but the worst part is how gleefully self-assured it is in its outdated notions of writing and design.  You only need to play Blue Estate for a minute or two to know everything there is to know about its 3ish hour-long play time. It’s an old-school arcade rail-shooter, one that doesn’t add any interesting new twists to hide the fact that all you’re doing is pointing at something and pressing a button to make it die over and over. Perhaps you could say the same for much of the genre, but the best ones - like House of the Dead and Time Crisis - inject tension and fun into the formula with a frantic pace, over-the-top set-pieces, and crazy boss battles. Blue Estate never makes even a half-hearted attempt at any such variety. Stages drag on for what seems like forever, waves of generic, slow-moving goons line up to catch bullets for you, and the few weapon pickups do little to spice things up either. The Dual Shock 4’s motion controls are surprisingly well-suited for handling the action, but when the action is so droning and uninspired, the controls hardly matter. There aren’t many things a game can be that I’d consider worse than “boring,” but “artlessly offensive” is one of them. From the title screen on, Blue Estate’s treatment of gender and race are a constant distraction. There is no grey area here. Protagonist Tony Luciano literally refers to his girlfriend as a thing that belongs to him. Blue Estate commits so completely to treating women like objects, and casting people of any race into the worst possible stereotypes that you’d think it was going for satire. But by the end of the first two levels, I had given up on waiting for some sort of message. There isn’t one. It really is just a long string of unfunny, poorly-written jokes made at the expense of others. That Blue Estate only ever grabs at the lowest of low-hanging fruit is completely infuriating on its own, but the fact that its also completely unfunny just adds insult to injury.  If you love low-brow jokes that aren't funny, and laughing at overweight people just because they exist, you’d still be hard pressed to enjoy Blue Estate. I have no idea if it’s faithful to the comics that spawned it, but after the time I’ve spent with it, I don’t think I want to know. It does a lazy imitation of a genre that’s always been short on creativity to begin with, and even if its prehistoric social politics didn’t bother me, its relentlessly try-hard approach to comedy surely still would have.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/resogun-heroes-dlc-review	" In my estimation, Resogun is still PlayStation 4's best game. Its stellar gameplay and the hard-to-escape addiction keeps it on top (though its insane graphics and effects don't exactly hurt), but for some, it's started to run its course since its launch alongside PlayStation 4 in November of 2013. To inject some freshness into its twin-stick, Defender-inspired shooter, developer Housemarque didn't only launch a free patch that adds some new goodies; it's also given the world Resogun's very first DLC pack, called Heroes,  that gashes open the barely healed wound of addiction. Heroes comes packing two new modes. Survival mode’s twist isn't well-hidden by its name, giving you one life to live in Resogun’s brutal gameplay. Instead of roving from stage to stage, you're instead placed in the same cylindrical world (a location called Avernus) as day-night cycles circulate in the background, marking the passage of time. The longer you survive, the more points you gain. Unlike the core experience, your multiplier is never in danger of being reset, and humans don't have to be saved. But you'll want to save them, because rescuing them in sequence gives you upgraded weapons, shields, bombs, and more, which will help you survive. They'll parachute in from the sky, spawn out of defeated enemies, and more. Protect yourself. You only have one life to live! The brutality and unhinged chaos of Survival Mode is what makes it so appealing. There is simply no room for error, especially if you're darting about without a shield. When you die, you die. Your score is your score, and there's nothing more you can do about it, other than playing again and trying to beat it. It gets really hard really rapidly, and is best played by veterans of Resogun's main campaign. New, wily enemies make it even trickier, giving experienced players new things to learn while retaining that ""just one more game"" hook that makes Resogun the hyper-addictive game that it is. Housemarque understands from its days crafting Super Stardust HD, Dead Nation, and Super Stardust Delta that competing with your friends on the leaderboards is half of the fun, which is why navigating those leaderboards after each game, switching between global and friends views, is easy, fast, and quick to update. One second, you can be in Survival Mode, the next, you can be dead. Seconds later, you can be in the leaderboards, and seconds after that, you can be back in-game, with the score you want to beat on your mind. You can bounce around with ease, with few loads and little standing in your way. Then again, if you don't want to go to the leaderboards, there are little reminders littered throughout the experience about how you've done in the past, as well as how your friends stack up. I was less fond of Heroes' other mode, Demolition, though I like and appreciate how different it is from anything else in Resogun. Here, the rules completely change. In short, your ship can no longer shoot. Instead, it can pulse energy every so often, energy that can be used to push around unbreakable balls that shatter enemies and obstacles in their wake. You can also pulse to kill enemies in your direct vicinity. Just watch your back: those balls you're shooting around the cylinder can easily come from behind you and knock you into oblivion. This mode is difficult and rewarding; I just wasn't all that crazy about how much of Resogun’s captivating pacing and quickness it sacrifices to get Demolition’s thoughtfulness and strategy. I came in like a wrecking baaaallllllll. As an aside, everyone who owns Resogun -- even if they choose not to buy the Heroes DLC -- has already received a free patch that has reset the leaderboards (which is sad), but also added a full ship creator. Crafting your own ship -- not only aesthetically, but in terms of its strengths and weaknesses -- is a blast, and better yet, you can share your creations online, find and rate other people's crafts, and use any ship created as your own. As my love of Mega Man 3 goes deep, I replicated the head of Magnet Man in Resogun, so naturally, you can make just about anything you want. I was especially impressed by some of the Star Wars creations floating around: TIE Fighters, X-Wings, and the like. You may not have needed a reason to return to Resogun -- because it's already so damn good -- but here we are. Survival is the stronger of Heroes’ two modes, and it has the greater hook, but Demolition is an interesting way of turning Resogun on its head. With new, freshly cleared leaderboards to compete on and a bunch of new Trophies to earn, Heroes succeeds on the periphery, too. But in reality, Resogun's core remains intact and as fun as ever. Heroes simply acts as a reason to come back for more."
Mikel Reparaz	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/sniper-elite-iii-review	 Sniper Elite III is a celebration of extravagant carnage - and, less significantly, a big improvement over 2012's Sniper Elite V2. Its predecessor's stiff, linear gameplay has been swapped out for a more open-ended, creativity-enabling approach to stealth-shooting. But the big draw – the real draw – is the same pornographically violent X-ray-vision carnage that erupts whenever your bullets meet their targets.  These slow-motion, long-range kills are what keep Sniper Elite III from being just another generic-looking World War II shooter. Every effort was made to milk them for dramatic tension. When aiming, you can hold your breath, slowing time so you can watch that red dot shrink in on your target. Tight close-ups of the bullet in flight are accompanied by a steadily swelling roar, giving your shot a sense of impending destiny. Provided your reaction to the resulting gore is a sick thrill and not actual sickness, this is so immensely satisfying that it renders every other weapon at your disposal anticlimactic by comparison. The kill-cam moments never got old enough for me to opt to skip them, but they might have if the rest of Sniper Elite III weren't so competently designed. Centering on Karl, a gravel-voiced American sniper, who seems to almost singlehandedly dismantle the German Afrika Korps, you are taken to a lot of interesting settings in a theater of the war that's rarely explored in games, and given semi-free rein to explore and murder Nazi occupiers in whatever way you deem fit. That’s what gives Sniper Elite III its edge - and not its story, which is awash in clichés and occasionally laughable dialogue. The campaign consists of just eight stages, but they’re a blast to creep through. Each one is enormous and has multiple objectives meant to give you a clear progression through the map, but how you reach and tackle those objectives is up to you. And when you factor in handfuls of enjoyable optional tasks, like blowing up a German motor pool or stealing top-secret plans, and the many deaths you're likely to die, finishing a single level can take as long as a couple of hours.  With a guard AI that’ll usually spot you if you run or even poke your head up above cover, Sniper Elite III encourages you to take it slow and stealthy, spotting and tagging guards with your binoculars. And should you decide to take a shot with anything but your silenced pistol – like, say, your sniper rifle – it's a good idea to either be near some noisy machinery that'll cover up the sound, or immediately move somewhere else after you take your shot. This push to relocate gives Sniper Elite III a fun, furtive cat-and-mouse feel, although like most stealth games, it doesn't always make sense; all you need to do is sneak or run a prescribed distance away from the guards until they forget you ever existed. But remember, there's no penalty for breaking stealth – and because you mainly earn experience through kills, there's no real reason not to clutter the horizon with bodies if you can get away with it. Dropping guards in quick succession always left me feeling like an efficient badass, even when it was due more to their uneven combat AI than my own skill.  Sniper Elite III's multiplayer maps are huge and filled with hiding places, and they're built to emphasize distance and sneakiness. In fact, two of the standout modes are Distance King and No Cross, which respectively reward teams based on the range of their kills, and separate them with impassable barriers meant to force them to snipe. These modes are enjoyable, but they're not fundamentally different from what you'd find in any other online shooter. Co-op, on the other hand, is much more rewarding. Not only can you tackle the entire campaign with a buddy, but you can also pair up in the waves-of-Nazis Survival mode and the engrossing Overwatch, which hands binoculars to one player and a rifle to the other, forcing you to work together as a sniper-spotter team. Sniper Elite III's open level designs and objectives pack in more than enough variety and stealthy tension to counterbalance its thin story and shaky enemy intelligence, and experimenting with its explosive traps is almost as fun as popping skulls with a sniper rifle. The skeleton-shattering, long-distance kills are still its riveting centerpiece, of course, but even without the element of dumb fun they offer, Sniper Elite III would still be a smart, unexpectedly memorable experience.
Daniel Krupa	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	 Video games are obsessed with warfare: ancient, covert, modern, futuristic. But Valiant Hearts is one of only a few to look at the first World War. It’s a studied depiction, but one in which you rarely shoot a gun. It’s a puzzle adventure that’s much more interested in how people are affected by such terrible events than recreating the violence. It occasionally gets too bogged down with historical trivia, but overall it’s a stylish and sincere adventure with a big heart. The most striking aspect of Valiant Hearts is the splendid art direction. Playing it really feels like watching a wonderful piece of animation, and I was surprised at just how versatile the style is. Of course, it shines at beginning when asked to depict the calm of rural France, but it’s equally effective when tackling much more difficult environments. The trenches and frontlines of the war, in particular, resemble scenes from Hell, with thick smoke weighing down from above and piles of corpses providing cover. Importantly, the cartoon style never conceals the horror of what is taking place.  Similarly, the characters have much more depth than their flat appearance initially suggests. Set along the border of France and Germany, the story tells the interlocking tales of five protagonists all touched by the war. You spend time with each one, and while the storytelling’s strong enough, it’s the animation which brilliantly reveals so much about each one. Barrel-chested Freddie struts into battle with the conviction of a man out for revenge, while Emile has a downtrodden gait that betrays a weariness that can’t be overlooked. While there are snatches of dialogue, a lot is also conveyed through the inarticulate yet strangely intelligible sounds made by these squat figures. The bold art style succeeds because of some deft touches, so it’s a shame that the narrator has no qualms with laying it on a bit thick. Nowhere is this more pronounced than at the end, which is predictably moving, though spoiled somewhat by the narrator underscoring what I already felt unprompted.  Unexpectedly, there’s also a sense of humor to be found. This works brilliantly on occasion, like when Ana flees Paris to the strains of the can-can. But elsewhere, it’s less well-judged. One of the points the story goes to great lengths to emphasize is the universal horror of war and how it affected people of all nationalities; one of the characters you play is a German soldier, even. So to have a bratwurst-chomping, pretzel-loving villain as the only identifiable antagonist seems at odds with the rest of the experience. He’s definitely more caricature than character. When it comes to gameplay, Valiant Hearts is an adventure full of puzzles which aren’t all that difficult to solve. It’s clear the experience is being pitched everyone, rather than those who need a challenge. This never bothered me in the slightest – the puzzles are satisfying enough to work through, and I actually think getting stumped would have undercut my interest in the plot. And there’s plenty of variety in what you’re given to do. Some puzzles involve simple object gathering, while others require strategic costume changes. You’ll lend your hand to plumbing, trench digging, and safe cracking. And it’s all in service of the plot, whether it’s reuniting loved ones or venturing behind enemy lines, the puzzles drive you forward. There are also more action-led sequences dotted throughout – again, they’re not particularly demanding, but do create some of standout moments. A particular highlight of mine was escaping from a POW camp by moonlight, evading torchlight and hiding behind scarecrows, bushes, and even a herd of wandering sheep. Throughout its six or so hour running time, Valiant Hearts does a magnificent job of incorporating so many aspects of the First World War. Each chapter introduces more iconic elements: zeppelins, flamethrowers, tanks, barbed wire, mustard gas, and even things like military insurrection. Everything finds a place. But what’s really great is they aren’t just chucked in – they’re always used in a way that makes sense: as a mechanic to learn, an obstacle to overcome, or even the basis for a new type of puzzle. Less successful is the way in which it flaunts historical credentials alongside the fiction it’s trying to unfold. You’re constantly bombarded with historical fact boxes. Reading them is entirely optional, but I found the prompt too insistent and a bit irritating. It totally clashes with the sense of style created by the art. Valiant Hearts does a great job of presenting such information through the world itself. It doesn’t need Encarta ‘95-style footnotes. Such crude trivia dumps are at odds with the game's presentation. It also creates some unnecessary tension between fact and fiction. Right at the beginning, we’re told these stories are freely adapted, and sometimes it’s more of a game than historical re-enactment, and I’m completely fine with that. For instance, there’s a section in which you attack a zeppelin with the help of a busted church organ in Reims’ cathedral. I’m pretty sure that didn’t happen… yet it works, providing a fun, memorable encounter that doesn’t undermine the subject matter. The slight awkwardness comes when the grim historical reality is presented immediately after one of these more fanciful interludes. Valiant Hearts focuses on how lives are torn apart, how strangers become saviors, and how madness thrives. It’s a small-scale human perspective of the war, which tries to salvage those little acts of love and heroism from a world overwhelmed by violence. There’s not much of a challenge or a reason to revisit once you’ve finished, but the story alone is worth experiencing. Ultimately, it’s a game about warfare that’s more interested in the people and their experiences, than bullets and their targets. I could’ve done without some of the footnotes and heavy-handed narration, but it remains a beautiful, harrowing experience nevertheless.
Shawn Saris	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	" One of my favorite moments playing War Thunder happened randomly as I flew for the Americans. Three friends came blasting past me in their WWII fighters, soaring to my aid, all while shouting ""America!"" into chat, and billowing plumes of red, white, and blue smoke out the tails of their planes. This random act of patriotism made me smile wide (even as a Canadian myself), and as they tore apart my enemies it highlighted what the free-to-play War Thunder does best.  You’re given the choice to fly through the skies in classic aircraft or stick to land and drive hulking tanks across large battlefields, though I found the air-to-air combat much better paced and fun. To be clear, there is no interplay between the tank and plane combat. While flying you’re bombing NPC tanks, so there’s no opportunity to coordinate between ground and air forces – somewhat disappointing for a game that offers both. [Correction: there is a mode that allows both land and air combat on one map.] Whether in the sky or on the ground, the 16v16 matches are filled with beautiful vehicle models that bring these classic machines to life. Creeping across the vibrant landscapes in a tank was great but my favorite moments would occur as I crested a mountain and rays of light would wash over my aircraft. Game types range from Domination to Ground Attack, and each has multiple objectives for different roles to complete, so you aren’t stuck doing the same thing repeatedly. Often times I would fly my Boston Mk1 bomber during Domination maps to lay waste to NPCs on the ground with hefty 500lb bombs, while my allies in more agile fighter planes handled base capture. Proper team communication, like calling for allies to shoot a fighter off my tail, is essential for success – especially true when playing in one of the harder modes. Most of my time was spent in the action-packed Arcade mode, where vehicle damage isn’t as severe and you have unlimited ammo and multiple respawns. I found War Thunder’s flow and pacing to be at its best here, but two other modes exist for the more hardcore enthusiasts: Realism mode increases the difficulty by adding limited ammo and harsher damage penalties, while Simulation takes it to the extreme, where a single mistake can spell doom, and you’re given no extra planes to respawn with. Helping lift War Thunder even higher is the audio. The planes sound terrific as their engines rumble to life on the airstrip, and the the sound of gunfire is deep and satisfying as bullets rain from the skies and bombs crash into fortified emplacements. In fact, some of my favorite moments stem from times where I've been able to hear an approaching aircraft and pinpoint its location just by the sound as it buzzes from ear to ear.  Using the mouse to handle all the steering of your vehicle on PC goes a long way to help a newcomer learn how to fly or drive, and even after several hours of play I found myself still using this basic setup with only minor tweaks to the layout. War Thunder doesn't leave the hardcore hanging either, offering a plethora of options for flight sticks or other peripherals. The PlayStation 4 version uses these standardized controls, with a single stick handling all movement of your aircraft. I found the system was less effective on PS4 due to the lack of precision a mouse and keyboard offer. It wasn’t until I dug into the menus and altered how the joysticks controlled my aircraft that I began to feel like I could fly with the same precision as the PC version, but it's doable. Unfortunately War Thunder begins to drift off course once you leave the field of battle. Between missions you are thrust back into the cluttered menus, where little is ever done to explain them or the meaning that lies behind them. It took me a long time of exploring just to find out how to change my research options and upgrade my crew. This left me feeling like I had constantly been at a disadvantage in combat, due to my lack of knowledge on how to properly upgrade and outfit my aircraft.  The sparse in-battle HUD stands in harsh contrast to the overly abundant and cumbersome menus between them, and this absence of information made things more difficult. Upon death, almost no information is given to you to help explain why your enemy was able to knock you from the sky. This lack of information even affects the currency, of which there are three types, but at no point was there ever a clear explanation of what each does. Spending them can even prove bothersome, and it isn’t until the post-battle screen pops up that I even got any hints. The one plus side is that at no point did War Thunder make it feel necessary to purchase anything, as my time was rewarded with generous amounts of research and currency. For a free-to-play game, that’s the most important thing behind actually being fun to play – and War Thunder generally gets both of those right. War Thunder gives us lots of reasons to get behind the stick, or wheel, of a ton of great World War II-era vehicles. With strong visuals and convincing audio backing it up, I thoroughly enjoyed the time I spent inside my P-36 Hawk, and its generous free-to-play model never got in the way. It’s mostly the moments in between battles that bring the whole experience down, as a lack of information and poor menus tarnish this flying ace."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	 At E3 2014, Sony invoked 1995-era SEGA with the sudden announcement of a product that was available right now. That product was a brand-new PlayStation 4 game -- Entwined -- and unfortunately, the way it was randomly announced and released is probably the most remarkable thing about it. Entwined is beautiful -- arrestingly so -- but unfortunately, it's also a game constructed around a contradiction. For as much as I appreciate its thoughtful approach and Thatgamecompany-like attempt at atmospheric storytelling, the fact remains that its pensive nature and understated trying-to-tell-you-something plot is obscured by its occasionally frustrating gameplay. It was hard for me to take its wonderful aesthetic in when I was left inevitably annoyed by the end of every stage, taking me out of the heady experience in the process.  At the core of Entwined is a simple and easy-to-understand gameplay morsel most reminiscent of the cult-hit PS3 game Dyad. A majority of the experience takes place in a series of endless tunnels, and within these tunnels rest a litany of orbs and obstacles colored blue and orange. Using DualShock 4's dual analog sticks, you take control of two dueling creatures -- a fish and a bird -- that each occupy their own 180 degree portion of the tunnel. Blue orbs should be collected by the blue creature, orange orbs by the orange creature, and occasionally, a green block means both animals should collide with it simultaneously. Entwined is, in premise, easy to pick up, play, and understand, even with very little in the way of typical text-laden tutorials. Its accessibility is one of its strengths. Regrettably, for as easy as it is to understand, its finicky controls can quickly lead to frustration. Each of the campaign's nine chapters require the collection of those aforementioned orbs to build up the dragons' respective meters to maximum, all the while colliding with successive like-colored barriers to sustain the meters' growth. Miss a barrier, and the like-colored meter takes a hit. Things are easy going in general until the end of each level, when a requirement to fuse the two dragons together by holding L1 and R1 rears its ugly head. Make a short series of mistakes, and the dragons become separated, requiring a new fusion attempt. It's easy to get caught in this cycle for minutes at a time, especially as sequences become more complicated, and the longer I was caught, the more removed from the ethereal nature of Entwined I became. It's truly a shame when a game this pretty and atmospheric makes you want to bang your hand on the table in frustration. This comes back to the flaw at the heart of Entwined: it's trying, at least in premise, to be the kind of art house game the PlayStation ecosystem has been so well-known for, joining the likes of Flower, Journey, and The Unfinished Swan. But its literal interpretation of what a game actually is removes greatly from its narrative power, especially because -- unlike Thatgamecompany's classics -- you're constantly reminded that you're playing a game, rather than being immersed in a unique experience. Entwined's Achilles' heel, for as well-intentioned as the entire project is, comes back to that simple point: if the adventure only lasts 90 minutes like Entwined (or like Journey before it), shouldn't it be a truly special 90 minutes? Or should it be littered with both promise as well as little annoyances? With only an hour and a half of gameplay in its Story mode, Entwined also comes packing a Challenge mode you can mess around with if you want, but otherwise, it's fairly barren of content, even at its affordable price. It's hard to take issue with its lush color palette, beautiful soundtrack, and overall atmosphere. I just wish that if Entwined insisted on reminding you that you're playing a game, that it did it with more subtlety and nuance, and less frustration. I started Entwined at the start of my work day, and -- after several pauses to write e-mails and attend to some other matters -- I was done by lunch. In that brief time, I came to appreciate its gorgeous aesthetics and moody soundtrack, but at the same time, I was never able to develop a rhythm playing the game itself. There's a wonderful nugget at its core, but the final product, when all features and factors combine, never shines enough to recommend it without a series of caveats.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/20/transistor-review	 Transistor is a wildly smart action-RPG that places all of its trust into your intelligence. Nothing from its cyberpunk story rife with mysteries, to its deep combat that encourages experimentation, is ever spelled out for you, which I personally loved. For its second game, developer Supergiant takes everything that felt right about Bastion’s world and storytelling, trims much of the fat, and adds depth to combat that turns each encounter in its six hours into a life-or-death puzzle. Transistor maintains the same hand-drawn style as Bastion -- it’s heavily influenced by the expressive character design of classic anime. Its gorgeous world feels like Blade Runner infused with Cowboy Bebop, in the best possible way. I love how none of the characters in Transistor fall into typical video game or science fiction conventions. Your hero Red is a lounge singer whose voice has been stolen as a part of a nefarious plot; Her partner in crime is a talking sword that acts as your chorus. Even the strange cabal of enemies have their own motivations that keep things from becoming black and white. By the end of a few boss battles, I felt genuine remorse when I had to lay the killing blow.  Transistor starts in the middle of the action, and it’s up to you to piece together what’s happened before, and what’s to come. It respects your ability to fill in the blanks, and relies on subtlety in a way that few games ever do. Music is also intrinsic in Transistor’s DNA. From Red’s former profession, to the various concert halls you visit along your adventure, to the incredible music that uses both a score as well as songs that exist inside the game world itself, Transistor is infused with the spirit of jazz. Even small actions, like being able to stop and have Red hum along to whatever song is currently playing is a creative, and evocative way of tying music to the core gameplay. For as gorgeous as Transistor is, the combat shines just as brightly. The battle mechanics are some of the most rewarding I’ve played in years. This is thanks in part to your ability to freeze time and plan out a series of moves. Once you’ve locked in your choices, restarting time and watching the success or folly of your actions never gets old. Watching Red freeze the world, teleport behind an enemy, slice them up with a series of melee attacks, then quickly teleport away before delivering a crushing energy spear never gets old. Transistor marries the quick reactions necessary in an action game with the careful planning of a strategy game in a really amazing way. Leveling up generally allows you to choose between a pair of skills, like deadly spears or more defensive abilities like temporary stealth. But Transistor’s real depth comes from the fact that each ability can be used actively, passively, or to augment and strengthen another skill. For example, a grenade-like skill can be used  as an active weapon, or makes enemies explode when you poke them with your lance, or to provide status buffs to your character. Transistor encourages experimentation and combat mastery by giving you tidbits of backstory as you use different combinations of abilities, and by allowing you to fully respec your character at any checkpoint. Alongside this, you’re also able to enter magical doors that transport you to your own personal beachside cabana that allows you to escape the ever-growing insanity of the outside world. It gives you a moment to take a breather, play through a series of challenge rooms, listen to the incredible soundtrack, and play with a strong contender for cutest digital dog of 2014.  My only gripe with combat comes from the lack of camera control. Buildings in the foreground have a tendency to block small slices of battle arenas, and the last thing you want in the middle of a tense fight is to lose sight of your character. Though this only happened a few times throughout the campaign, it was enough to take me out of the experience on each occasion. The PlayStation 4 and PC versions are nearly identical save for one feature: On PS4, you can choose to have the sword’s voice come out of the speaker on the controller. While it seems gimmicky on paper, I found myself playing through the entire game this way, and really appreciating the immersion it added to my experience. Transistor’s the kind of game that made me immediately jump back in to take on New Game Plus. I wanted to continue exploring the excellent combat in new, more challenging scenarios. I wanted to double back on the areas that I’d missed the first time through, and try to fill in the gaps of the fantastic story. But most of all, I wasn’t ready to leave Red or her world behind
Scott Thompson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/14/sportsfriends-review	 Let’s start here: Sportsfriends is the most exciting local multiplayer game since Wii Sports set your parents’ living room on fire in 2006. That’s not the remarkable thing about Sportsfriends, though; what’s remarkable is that it manages to bring four disparate styles of gameplay together into one cohesive package that caters to casual partygoers and committed players alike. The rather demanding hardware and space requirements might limit which games you can play, but your living room will be filled with raucous laughter and yelling just the same.  Sportsfriends’ four games mostly walk the fine line of being simple enough to learn quickly--for optimal controller exchanging at big parties--while offering an incredible amount of depth for the ultra-competitive. This point is driven home especially well by Johann Sebastian Joust and BaraBariBall, Sportsfriends’ two best games. Johann Sebastian Joust reminds me of the playground games of my childhood, feeling like a blend of tag and musical chairs. It ditches the TV altogether, and instead has you moving around in real space trying to shake your opponent’s Move controller enough to knock them out of the game. Fully enjoying Johann Sebastian Joust isn’t easy thanks to needing Move controllers for every participant (you can use the less-responsive DualShock 4 controllers, but it isn’t recommended) and plenty of space to run around, but it’s entirely worth the trouble. Carefully grasping the glowing Move controller while attempting to knock your opponent’s around is like a calculated game of chicken, where moving in to attack also leaves you vulnerable. The controller becomes less sensitive when the music speeds up, urging you to attack, and intelligently injecting a dose of frantic urgency. With jousters encircled by spectators waiting for their turns, it also looks entertainingly similar to a Michael Jackson music video. Back on the couch, the other standout is BaraBariBall. which has up to four people beat the crap out of each other as they try to toss a ball into their designated section of water beneath the level. I found the immediate chaos to be incredibly fun, but soon, strategies began to develop. Moving, attacking, and throwing became precise as I found better ways to score without giving my opponents time to intercept the ball. The depth of play is amplified by the three different playable characters, each with its own unique stats and abilities, and the variety of stages that require distinct planning. I wouldn’t be surprised to see competitive BaraBariBall played at fighting game tournaments. It really is that deep. Tag, you're it! The final two games are fun in their own right, but its hard for them to escape the looming shadow of Johann Sebastian Joust and BaraBariBall. Hokra is a super-abstracted game of two-on-two basketball that seems straight forward at first, but becomes incredibly competitive as you master the ability to bank passes to teammates off of walls. Super Pole Riders’ analog stick controls take a few matches to get comfortable with, but once you master using your pole to block opponents’ movement, and nudge the ball out of your opponent’s reach, knocking opponents off their poles; there’s plenty of freedom to playfully troll your friends. The future of the Olympics? The “s” on the end of Sportsfriends is of importance; these four minigames are much better with a group than a single friend, and one, Hokra, even requires four players. Additionally, none of Sportsfriends’ games have options for a single player. There are no AI opponents, online matches, high score challenges, or any other type of mode for the friend-challenged. This means you’re going to need lots of people and controllers to really get the most out of it. Super Pole Riders and Hokra try to bridge the gap with an option for two players to each share a controller, but it proves to be rather unwieldy. Catch! Oh, and if you own both a PS3 and PS4, go with the PS3 version. The PS4 version only supports up to four bluetooth devices at once, where the PS3 handles seven.. Four players is certainly enough to have a good time, but the more players, the more fun and chaotic Johann Sebastian Joust becomes. Sportsfriends is one of the most dynamic and addictingly deep local multiplayer games I’ve ever played. Each of the four games provides its own unique rules and fun, and Johann Sebastion Joust and BaraBariBall are each strong enough to be sold on their own. Between DualShock controllers, Move controllers, groups of players, and ample space, the hurdles to fully enjoy Sportsfriends are high, but clearing them gives way to an incredible party game full of yelling, celebrating, fist-pumping, and innumerable expletives; the combined cornerstone of all great parties.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/12/titan-attacks-review	 Titan Attacks is proof that certain games are timeless and endlessly influential. While some folks claim that nostalgia is a powerful blinder, I'd argue that the opposite can also be true. Some developers understand that brilliant gameplay nuggets remain buried in dormant 30-plus year-old games, and no amount of $100 million marketing budgets, four year dev cycles, or never-ending promises of something new will change that. Beware the Martians. As such, Taito's timeless arcade shooter Space Invaders -- first released in 1978 -- is the blatantly obvious inspiration for Titan Attacks, and developer Puppygames wisely decided to run towards the comparisons instead of trying to hide from them. Titan Attacks isn't as difficult as Space Invaders -- nor is it as quintessentially excellent -- but it does encompass the same spirit as Taito's coin-gobbling classic, keeping you engaged with its endless cycle of high score-chasing. Except this time around, those high scores are global and online instead of on a single machine in your local pizza parlor. Titan Attacks looks both retro and modern, with simple graphics befitting a game like this, and it looks the part whether you're playing on PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, or PlayStation Vita (Titan Attacks is cross-buy, and it plays virtually identically on all three platforms while sharing a Trophy list). Its sound effects and musical accompaniment aren't all that impressive, though I found the experience most fun on Vita while watching hockey on TV… so muting it is certainly a viable option. To play Titan Attacks, simply abuse the X button on your DualShock controller or Vita while using either the left analog stick or directional pad to move your ship to the left or to the right (there is no vertical movement allowed). The beauty of such an easy control scheme -- another hallmark of old-school arcade shooters -- is that it's accessible. Its depth isn't hidden underneath a litany of obtuse control options. You shoot and you move, and that's pretty much it (unless you want to demolish your enemies with the occasional Smart Bomb, that is).  Unlike Space Invaders, Titan Attacks isn't plodding and deliberate. It's fast-paced and souped-up. You'll see everything it has to offer in only a couple of hours of play, but that's because it moves at such a fast clip. Enemies will rove back and forth atop the screen -- and some will even shoot back at you with all manner of lasers and bombs -- and it's up to you to move along with them, dodging their assaults while obliterating them as quickly as possible. It's a simple and undeniably fun premise, one that doesn't take too much thought or require too much attention. It's easy to develop a rhythm while playing, and part of Titan Attacks draw is that you're likely to see a demonstrable increase in your own skill level after only a little bit of practice. Apart from the speed of the game and the overall mayhem on your screen, a major differentiator between Titan Attacks and Space Invaders is Titan Attacks' emphasis on earning money to buy ship upgrades. Indeed, much of the experience revolves around stashing away hard-earned loot to spend on increasingly significant alterations to your craft, like the addition of new guns, the ability to shoot more bullets at a time, and -- perhaps most critically -- the hording of defensive energy that allows you to withstand endless barrages of enemy fire (and the occasional ill-timed ship collision). Unfortunately, such upgrading slashes the difficulty perhaps too significantly. By the time you've maxed your ship's guns, bullet capacity, and speed, you'll be smashing your way through some late-game stages in literally seconds. The real challenge comes from the busier levels with lots of crossfire and aggressively-roving enemies, but even then, you're usually only in danger of dying during one of the game's five boss battles (unless you've neglected to buy more health for your ship, at which point you could die just about anywhere). Travel to the Moon... and Mars... and Saturn?! Interestingly, the sheer chaos your upgraded ship can unleash does interfere with one of Titan Attacks' unique components. Every so often, a ship you destroy will crumble into wreckage and fall towards you, allowing you to shoot it again for bonus points. Likewise, every so often, an alien pilot will bail out of his crippled ship. Shoot him, and you'll negate a possible monetary bonus. But capture him, and you'll earn some extra cash for your digital wallet. Saving aliens becomes a near impossibility once you're peppering your foes with a ton of bullets at a time, rendering this interesting feature somewhat moot and half-baked. Still, these are minor asides for a game that is, at its core, a fun time-waster, especially for those who like to grind away on high score leaderboards. I especially like how -- in old-school fashion -- Titan Attacks never actually ends, even after you get through its 100 stages. You simply begin again at level one with your score and craft intact, with slightly ramped-up difficulty. This is a nice way to beckon you to come back for more, if for any other reason than besting your buddies on the scoreboard. Just expect to throw a few curses out when you get hit and lose that precious score multiplier. I like Titan Attacks, and it's a game I'll certainly return to every now and then to see if I can climb a little higher up those leaderboards. It's a basic game in design and premise with just enough there to keep things interesting, and while it's not even remotely going out on a ledge with new design philosophies, beautiful graphics, or a lengthy campaign, its hook resides in its quaintness. It's unapologetically old-school. Unfortunately, that old-school nature means while there's fun to be had, the amount of content is light.
Rowan Kaiser	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/12/bound-by-flame-review	 It’s a good thing that Bound By Flame’s combat is its strongest point, because almost every major in-game conflict is resolved through violence. Structurally, it’s largely linear; though smaller maps and quests can be explored and completed in different orders, it’s always constrained by narrow corridors and a fairly rigid plot. Thankfully though, it strikes a harmony between its entertaining combat system and thoughtful role-playing progression, giving it a consistent forward momentum that held my attention despite its inconsistent story and writing.  The role-playing systems that support the combat in Bound By Flame are simple, but quite effective. Your character has three skill trees, labeled Warrior, Ranger, and Pyromancer, but effectively serving as a slow sword, fast daggers, and spells. Combat stances can be toggled on-the-fly mid-battle, with your selection of fire spells being available in both. I found I spent most of the early game in the defensive Warrior stance, but finished the bulk of the campaign using the speedy Ranger daggers. Every progression choice felt like a viable play-style though, allowing me to find what I liked, and exploit it to the fullest. With each level gained you can choose what appear to be minor buffs, like a higher critical rating on fireballs, or health regeneration in Warrior stance. Very few of these skill improvements read like they’re major enhancements on their own - this is not a game where you go from having 15 hit points to 1500 - but they cumulatively give your character a great feeling of progression. Make enough smart choices, and even something like slightly increasing the chance of dagger attacks interrupting enemy actions can make your character feel like a combat god. Much of Bound By Flame’s combat is built around timing and precision, like when you face opponents who carry shields on their front and their back. You’ll need to either hit them from their flanks with daggers, or best them with perfectly-timed blocks and counter-attacks. The notably responsive controls are up to the task, conveying the rhythms of one-against-many combat surprisingly well. The same can’t be said for some of the single-opponent fights though, which can be either predictable and easy, or downright cheap, though those are happily quite rare. Bound By Flame creates a bleak fantasy world, which it attempts to fill with a grimy, cynical perspective and dark humor. Sadly, neither the writing or voice acting are strong enough to quite pull off these ambitious storytelling goals. Its mercenaries are unsurprisingly profane and written to be amusingly juvenile, but their bawdy insults and nasty jokes are only clever half the time.The other half they fall flat thanks to wildly inconsistent voice acting and writing, which often wind up being unintentionally amusing.  Bound By Flame also misses the mark with its much-touted ability to choose how to deal with the demon that has possessed your body. The big choices you’re supposed to make often end up being immediately irrelevant. Will you decide to join the battle for a major city, or ignore it and follow the demon’s quest? Either way, you’re sent to fight for the city. Many other times you aren’t even given choices at all; the demon simply takes over and does what it wants anyway. This lack of consistency makes caring about Bound By Flame’s plot far too difficult to sustain. Need a dentist? On the plus side, much of the rest of Bound By Flame’s presentation worked well. I quite liked most of the music, particularly some of the arrhythmic, drum-based tracks used during more demonic battles. The character models and animations are strong as well, particularly on the smooth-running PC version. However, I was disappointed by how jerky the frame rate got on PS4 when special lighting and water effects appeared on-screen. Bound By Flame has one huge strength: the harmony between its entertaining combat and role-playing systems. Granted, its weak storytelling does weigh it down, and its performance on PS4 is a bit of a bummer, but the strong core of its gameplay powers it through to transcend these flaws. Bound By Flame’s combination of progression and action ultimately make it greater than the sum of its parts.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/08/outlast-whistleblower-review	 Outlast: Whistleblower is a grim, two-hour expansion that thrusts you back into the hellish world of Mount Massive Asylum, and for better or worse, forces you through the same brutal torture as the main game. But if subverting expectations is a core tenant of horror, Whistleblower drops the ball by making every second of your adventure feel like deja-vu. As the title suggests, you play as the man who tipped Miles Upshur off to the horrific goings-on at the asylum. Shortly after sending the inflammatory email, you’re captured and forced to endure the horrors of the crumbling institution. Whistleblower acts as both a prologue and epilogue to the main game, and contains some genuinely interesting story beats that help flesh out just what the hell has been happening. Once again, there are also documents scattered about that provide well-written bits of information on world and its inhabitants.  Sadly, a lot of the environments in the expansion feel like retreads of places we've already been to. Your journey is ostensibly the inverse of the main game -- you start in the underground laboratories, and eventually make your way to the asylum-proper. But wrecked offices, disgusting bathrooms, and foggy exteriors lose their evocative power the the second time around, and this general sense of familiarity really works against Whistleblower. The DLC still maintains Outlast's impeccably gruesome visuals and sound design, but doesn't ever manage to deliver anything truly refreshing. Enemy encounters and scare patterns feel exactly the same, removing quite a bit of suspense. Sure, the jump scares still got me 100% of the time, but Whistleblower failed to build that great sense of tension that the opening hour of the original did so successfully. A strange thing about a lot of these jump scares is that they appeared to me as audio-only. Whether because I had my night-vision off, or perhaps I was facing the wrong way, I was often greeted with a loud bang, a violin snap, and no visual clues whatsoever. Moments like this come across less as terrifying, and more just straight-up confusing. You're still powerless against the ghouls that roam the asylum, so you'll have to run and hide anytime you're spotted. This is where a lot of Whistleblower's problems come to surface. Mission objectives are vague, and the level layout is more labyrinthine than ever. This led to a lot of frustration when I was trying to run away from a pursuer without any clue where I needed to go. There's also a heavy emphasis placed on climbing up very specific and easily missable surfaces, which only compounds the confusion.  It gets even worse thanks to a slew of narrow hallways that often forbid you from maneuvering around your attacker when cornered. Even more so than the original, I found myself dying over and over until I figured out where the game wanted me to go, and what it wanted me to do. Nothing kills horror and tension quite as swiftly as frustration. Outlast: Whistleblower delivers more of the same gruesome locales and jump-scares as the core game, but doesn't introduce much new to the horror experience. Its sound design is still top notch, and it took me to some dark places that few video games ever dare to go. But while Whistleblower sheds a bit of light on the mysteries of the original, but ultimately feels far too familiar, far too often.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/29/daylight-review	 It took me three hours to finish Daylight’s randomly generated maze of horror. While two of those hours managed to be somewhat spooky, one was pure frustration, spent wandering aimlessly through hallways in first-person perspective, looking for a collectible item I’d missed. In that time, the well-constructed atmosphere and story drained away and revealed Daylight’s true frame: a formulaic find-the-hidden-object game padded out with some meaningless crate puzzles.  What’s scarier than being hunted in the dark? Being hunted in the dark and lost, that’s what. Daylight’s abandoned hospital is a great horror environment, complete with powerfully unsettling creaks and whispers and groans, spontaneously moving objects, foreboding narration, and all the other trappings I expected from a quality horror game. Finding your way around by the light of a smartphone (which is also your minimap) gives it a nice contemporary touch, too, and it shows off some impressive lighting effects. The foundation is sound. But Daylight puts too much stock into its atmosphere, and neglects to actually do something to keep my attention and drive me forward. Because of a general lack of direction, which probably has something to do with the first half’s procedurally generated corridors, and a general lack of things to do except look for hidden items, it lost me early and never recovered. After running in circles for 20 minutes trying to figure out what I was supposed to do, the bad things were no longer scary. The enemies, called shadows, appear from nowhere and lurch toward you, mouths agape. Their design is creepy, but they don’t even pose a threat in the early hours, and when they do they soon became little more than moving obstacles, easily chased away with the large number of flares littered throughout the world. Once my tolerance to their jump scares built up, they just weren’t frightening at all for the duration. Worse, the hospital is full of tedious box-pushing puzzles. They’re so uninspired they felt like they only exist to keep you from seeing the credits roll in under two hours. To make progress in Daylight you have to find a number of “remnants,” which are well-written and sometimes genuinely creepy written tidbits or images that fill in the overall mystery. This is the main delivery method for the story, and piecing together the events that landed me here feels satisfyingly like putting together a puzzle. But they’re not enough of a reward to make the weak exploration and the frustrating search for the final pieces worthwhile. Even with the magic glow sticks that highlight interactive objects, scrounging around is a pain.  It’s a shame the earlier environments become so repetitive, because the forest areas toward the end are much better and more varied, and they make more sense within Daylight’s randomized design. In a maze of poorly lit gray corridors clues can be anywhere – nailed to walls or hidden in boxes – and I had to search every uninteresting corner to make sure I hadn’t missed something. In the forest, they were generally stashed in places that made sense, generally in one of the broken-down buildings. That kept me moving at a more enjoyable pace.  It moved along so fast, in fact, that when I finished I didn’t feel like I was anywhere near the ending. That’s a disappointment, because I was ready to play more once the level design opened up. The ending itself is a satisfactory horror-story twist that didn’t blow my mind, but does make sense. That brings up a question: a big part of Daylight’s appeal was supposed to be that its procedural generation would inspire replayability, but without lasting horror or events that make use of the shifting environment in interesting ways, what’s the point in playing it again? I saw all I needed to see the first time through, and the second time didn’t even have the fear of the unknown going for it.    PlayStation 4 Version Daylight on the PS4 looks and feels nearly identical to its PC counterpart. The only noticeable difference is the slightly longer load time when entering a new area, but it's barely significant enough to mention. The nice lighting, cloth effects, and other visual bells and whistles are in full effect, and Daylight's controls transfer very well onto the DualShock 4.   Daylight has a good foundation of scary atmosphere and interesting bits of story. All of that is squandered by the first half, where poor level design, unnecessary box-pushing puzzles, and impotent enemies deflate the scares before it even gets going. By the time I reached the more interesting second act, I’d grown immune to its tricks and could only see it as a mediocre series of fetch quests. Editor’s Note: Two former IGN employees worked on Daylight’s development. To ensure an impartial review, we selected a reviewer who joined IGN after both had departed.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/25/mercenary-kings-review	 Mercenary Kings -- a fun side-scrolling, old-school shooter -- pays reverence to many corners of gaming's past without being half-baked or derivative. For as much as I love the grittiness of a modern first-person shooter, the frights of a contemporary survival-horror adventure, or getting lost in the sprawling open-world map of a western RPG, I have a soft spot for old-school-inspired games that look dated, yet feel at home in today's gaming landscape, that pay homage to the past while staying relevant in the present. Mercenary Kings is one such game. SNK's storied Metal Slug franchise is probably Mercenary Kings' single biggest inspiration both aesthetically and in terms of gameplay, though there are shades of Monster Hunter, Contra, Mega Man, and much more here, too. The Monster Hunter association is most important, however, simply because Mercenary Kings isn't just a linear shooter, but a mission-based one rife with tons of loot drops that, in turn, can be used to craft stronger gear.  The loot system is Mercenary Kings' greatest draw, and the focus of its identity. For as fun as it is to play, Mercenary Kings' addictive quality comes from the never-ending need to collect and synthesize. That's not only uncommon in side-scrolling shooters; it's virtually unheard of. Running through its 100+ levels, killing tons of enemies, and gathering what they leave behind is essential if you want to survive, and with a jaw-dropping amount of weapons, components, armor, and much more to create and equip, there's no shortage of reasons to stay engaged. It's a game that's almost impossible to rush through. Thankfully, getting into the nitty-gritty of Mercenary Kings' impressive equipment system doesn't mean you have to play a subpar, boring, or ill-executed shooter. Quite the opposite, in fact. Running and gunning through various environments -- abandoned caves, sprawling complexes, sewer systems, and more -- is a lot of fun, especially when you begin to learn its nuanced controls. Its active reload-style gunplay -- ripped straight out of the likes of Gears of War -- means that you have to be thoughtful during firefights. You can't reload constantly and expect to have any success. Likewise, enemies tend to do an inordinate amount of damage. All of this creates a sort of digital ballet, a careful dance of crisscrossing bullets, artful rolls and dodges, and tons of pixelated blood. Speaking of pixelated blood, I adore the way Mercenary Kings looks and sounds. Games using pixel art are a dime a dozen today, but Mercenary Kings has style. Character designs are unique and appealing; your base camp is littered with memorable characters, and the game's bad guys are archetypal, yet charming. There are a ton of enemies to do battle with, too, from gun-and-knife-wielding humans to robots to beasts and more, though there's a fair bit of palette-swapping to be found. As for the soundtrack, let's just say this: it's one of the best gaming soundtracks I've heard in years. Track-in and track-out, I was stunned by Mercenary Kings' attention to audio quality and fidelity. I just wish its long-winded story was more interesting. I found myself skipping every cutscene after only an hour of play, just so I could get back into the action. While I'm making wishes, I wish Mercenary Kings had tighter controls. For the most part, everything works as you'd expect, but there are certain issues that stand out. Pressing down to shoot from your belly doesn't always work, jumping can be finicky, and occasional split-second freezes interrupted my flow. But part of conquering the 20-plus hour campaign is in overcoming certain perceived deficiencies. It's weird to say, but in this respect, it has that true old-school spirit. It's like playing Castlevania with its crazy midair collision kickback, or Dragon Warrior with its random, out-of-left-field ass-kicking enemies. This is what Mercenary Kings is; figuring out how to work within its rules is part of the fun. Mercenary Kings' more modern elements come from its rank-based play, sprawling maps, and online components. Stages are unlocked one rank at a time, and groups of stages must be completed to move on to the next group. Missions will take place on many of the same maps -- and I definitely wish there was a greater variety of locations -- but your tasks on each map, and the time you're given to get through each mission, will vary significantly. On one map, you may be given 30 minutes to rescue 16 hostages from every corner of a complex. But you may go back to that same complex with a focus on a particular section of it, with 10 minutes to clear a certain amount of enemies. If you want to play with your friends, you can absolutely do that, whether locally or online. Mercenary Kings allows for up to four people to play at once. Local play isn't ideal because it cuts the screen up, but online play is a great way to ease Mercenary Kings' grueling difficulty if it starts to cramp your style. Then again, I played the entire campaign by myself, so it's by no means necessary. Mercenary Kings is a slick old-school inspired shooter that has one foot in the past, and the other firmly planted in the present. Its high level of difficulty, catchy tunes, and pixelated graphics meld nicely with its emphasis on loot, customization, and online play. While some control issues get in the way, it comes highly recommended to those looking for a fun side-scrolling shooter to play, or folks simply looking for a taste of the games of yore.
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/23/octodad-dadliest-catch-ps4-review	 Octodad: Dadliest Catch is very much my kind of game. The central conceit of an octopus masquerading as a human is pure absurdist genius, and a premise worthy of even the most coked-up ‘80s sitcom producer. And as the name suggests, Octodad is married with children, and must maintain the façade of being a regular Joe even at home. It’s a great set-up for genuinely amusing gameplay and a surprisingly sweet story. Dadliest Catch doesn’t give any context initially, instead dropping us straight into Octodad’s wedding day. It’s a deliberately bizarre place to start, and a good training ground for the controls. Each one of Octodad's tentacle legs is controlled independently; your body flopping about as you lurch drunkenly around, while objects can be picked up with a single, snaking arm. It’s actually quite intuitive, and you’ll have your tux on and attempt a nonchalant walk down the aisle in no time.   Unlike other games from a similar lineage, such as QWOP or Surgeon Simulator 2013, Octodad’s humour isn’t derived from an arcane difficulty or overly elaborate controls, but from physical comedy, pure and simple. It’s just innately funny controlling Octodad as he staggers and stumbles. If John Cleese were an invertebrate, his silly walk would look something like this. Dadliest Catch revels in the inherent humour of its concept, littering areas with physics objects to get caught on or to clamber up, or liberally applying that slapstick staple – the banana peel – to its environments. Octodad is a lovable lead character, too. His every burble is translated to hilarious effect during conversations with his family, or when he’s steeling himself to action, and it’s complemented by great sound work. Think Futurama’s Zoidberg and you’d be on the right track. I burst out laughing when he started burbling a ditty to himself at one point. One too many glasses of crab juice. A side effect of the focus on comedy, however, is that Dadliest Catch is just not that hard; Octodad is far happier being the goofy, easy-going friend that makes you laugh than it is trying to be your demanding drill sergeant who delights in testing your will to go on. That’s fine, of course; I’d prefer to be charmed than frustrated, but it’ll only take a couple of hours to play through the story - even with the new objectives that have been added for PS4 since the initial PC release. What is here is great, however. There’s plenty of variety in objectives, and no one idea outstays its welcome. You’re whisked from mowing the lawn and making coffee at home to climbing through freezer cabinets and shopping for soda in a supermarket, and on to a terrifying trip to the aquarium, where posters featuring a stern-faced scientist and the text “Our biologists know a fish when they see one” threaten to expose our hero as the cephalopod in disguise that he is. So meta. Each level presents its own riffs on the core gameplay. Climbing an obstacle course in the aquarium is a highlight, with ladders, bridges, and zip-lines, but it’s just one location within the complex. Elsewhere, there are mini-games to test your tentacle-eye coordination, ventilation shafts to thread through, and the answer to the age-old question: “Can an octopus posing as a human climb an escalator that’s determined to go down as quickly as possible?” And the follow-up question: “Can an octopus disguised as a human in a hammerhead shark outfit fool eagle-eyed biologists?” It’s charming and funny, and the PS4 version builds atop the PC original, tweaking level layouts and adding in new objectives to help flesh out some of the leaner missions towards the end of the game. The flashback sequence Sea Legs, for instance, has been bulked out considerably with six new objectives. None of them feel in any way integral to the level, but that's not the point. Sometimes swabbing the deck aboard a violently rocking ship or doing a jig to prove your sea credentials are their own reward. The mission Silent But Dadly is perhaps the most altered, with a couple of sequences that play quite differently on PS4 compared to PC. The result is a level with more gameplay - and more chaos - but it's arguable whether the redux is actually superior to the original. Thankfully both versions are good fun. You'll laugh, you'll cry, you'll wish there were crazy side-missions! It's great to see Young Horses revisiting Dadliest Catch in such a significant way before releasing it on PS4, but I can't help but think the team is still missing the most obvious way to improve the game as a whole. More content is appreciated, but what I'd like to see is different content, such as optional challenges that really ramp up the difficulty and take the gameplay to its logical conclusion. Octodad as a whole isn't meant to be hard, which is why - even with some extra objectives - you can breeze through it so quickly, so why not add in some crazy scenarios that completionists can get stuck into once they've finished the story? As it stands, there are ties hidden in each level for players to seek out, plus the option to play through the game controlling Octodad cooperatively with up to three friends, which is an inspired inclusion. Those of you that own Move controllers and a PS4 camera can also test out the Move functionality, which is reasonable enough. Moving Octodad's snaking arm about with the Move is certainly a good fit, and this is combined with the standard control scheme of using twin analogue sticks and triggers to walk, so it's not a difficult adjustment. Some challenges are made significantly harder with the Move, but it's fun to play around with nonetheless. One last thing that's worth noting - Dadliest Catch doesn't always feel hugely optimised for PS4. It runs well for the most part, but I definitely noticed the odd frame rate drops - most noticeably in the aforementioned Sea Legs mission. Young Horses has done an excellent job taking the diamond in the rough that was the original Octodad student project and turning it into a short but charmingly absurdist physics game. While it doesn’t quite take the extra step that would cement its place as a classic, lovers of physical comedy owe it to themselves to check Dadliest Catch out.
Ryan McCaffrey	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/04/mlb-14-the-show-review	 (Ed. note - For a slick look at the visual upgrade from the PS3 to the PS4 version of MLB 14: The Show, check out our full graphics comparison here.) MLB 14: The Show is another great baseball outing almost by default, as it returns all of the rewarding modes along with the strong fundamental hitting, pitching, and fielding mechanics that made this series famous. But as a returning fan, I had a hard time getting excited about this year’s new features outside of the obligatory roster updates. It’s got couple of winning ideas, like player-made scenarios and cross-play support with the Vita, but with the laggy online play and load times as long as a Red Sox-Yankees game, it feels like Sony reached the limits of what the PS3 can handle a year or two ago. Just as in last year’s MLB 13: The Show, the players look and animate beautifully – including myriad little details like end-over-end bat flips after a swing-and-miss or a second baseman’s backhanded flip to the shortstop to initiate a double play. All of it controls well, though, and you’ve once again got plenty of input options for each aspect of game. In particular, I find that the Pulse Pitching introduced last year strikes the best balance of realism and fun. But again, this is all stuff I saw and liked last year, so it doesn’t really feel new and shiny.  On the field, Road to the Show has long been The Show’s signature mode. In assigning your created player a single position and playing five-minute games involving only his at-bats and defensive plays, it’s once again a bite-sized, consistently rewarding mode. Its compelling RPG-like experience system rewards your good play with the chance to spend Training Points on your avatar – in my case, hot 2B prospect Ryan McCaffrey – to improve his skills and inch him closer to his major-league debut and, eventually, career. A new pre-draft showcase, seemingly lifted straight from NBA 2K12 and later, gives you the option to get drafted after playing in an amateur showcase. I was taken with the 30th and final pick in the second round by the Cardinals, but the game made me wait for every single one of the 29 other names to be called in the round before it would let me proceed. I saw no way to button through this. Fortunately, you can also bypass this entirely and simply brute-force your player onto any team you wish. Road to the Show is MLB’s biggest and sharpest hook, but MLB 14 casts a few extra lines in the water this year as well. Community Challenges let you craft and upload scenarios both realistic and improbable for others to play, like the two-out, bottom-of-the-ninth-in-Game-7-of-the-World-Series situation I made. It adds a clever crowdsourced twist on a mode we’ve seen in other sports games, such as NBA Live 14.  Meanwhile, Franchise mode has finally gone online, though my experiences have not been good. I suffered frustrating levels of lag and choppiness in head-to-head matchups, while load times in general – but particularly when jumping into online modes – were long with the recommended 10GB hard-drive install and downright eternal on the standard, mandatory 5GB installation. Adding Cross-Play (but sadly not Cross-Buy) support for the Vita version of MLB 14 is an incredibly welcome feature, particularly when modes such as Franchise can be enjoyed for dozens if not hundreds of hours. And my other new favorite new timesaver is Quick Counts, which drastically reduces the amount of time it takes to get through a nine-inning game by starting every batter on both teams with a deep count (i.e. 1-2, 2-1, 3-0, or 0-2), much like the IGN softball team’s beer-league rules. I only wish it could be toggled on or off during a game. Sadly, it must be activated before you take the field.   PlayStation 4 Version  Here’s the good news regarding the PS4 version of MLB 14: The Show: it maintains complete feature parity with the PS3 edition. Absolutely nothing is lost. But that’s the semi-bad news: nothing – outside of a few new animations sprinkled in – is gained, either. The key difference is in the raw visuals, which should make you happy. Where the PS3 game recommends you play at 720p, The Show soars in 1080p on PS4. This is a gorgeous port, no doubt. Players look fantastic – easily on-par with the hoopsters of NBA 2K14 on PS4 – and the ballparks have been given a much-needed refresh. But it’s not all peanuts and Cracker Jacks; the loading times are abysmal on the new console, and a stuttering framerate during many non-gameplay shots drag down the otherwise stunning broadcast-like presentation. Meanwhile, the game’s other minor annoyances – all detailed in the rest of this review – remain. If you’ve got a PS4, there’s no debating it: the next-gen version is the no-brainer version to buy – but only if you’ve been holding out and don’t already have it on PS3. And those are the SportsCenter highlights. MLB 14 again offers rock-solid pitching, hitting, and fielding mechanics – and multiple choices for each one. This is, yet again, a stellar baseball simulation that’s packed with enough quality game modes to occupy and entertain me for the entire season, but there are few exciting new features, and online is currently a very laggy experience.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/03/dead-nation-apocalypse-edition-review	 It's hard not to appreciate a developer like Housemarque. In an industry where lots of studios lack consistency, Housemarque has it in droves. It outputs high quality, critically acclaimed and commercially successful products with regularity, such as PlayStation's Super Stardust series, the multi-platform side-scroller Outland, and PS4's best game, Resogun. The oft-overlooked Dead Nation also deserves to be in the conversation, and thankfully, its re-release on PlayStation 4 puts it back on the radar. Dead Nation: Apocalypse Edition is pretty much identical to the Dead Nation that came to PlayStation 3 back in 2010. It's the same addictive, difficult twin-stick shooter, but with some bundled-in DLC and extra perks to keep you busy. Then again, even if Apocalypse Edition was nothing more than a mere retread of the original game, it'd still be a blast playing it all over again.  Thrust into a zombie-filled post-apocalyptic world, your task in Dead Nation is simple: survive another day. Survival requires you to work your way through an urban sprawl littered with the undead. With powerful weapons at your disposal -- think assault rifles, flamethrowers, and grenades -- you can get creative with how you kill your foes. Shoot them in the head with a powered-up rifle shot. Blast a nearby car to make its alarm go off, drawing their attention, allowing you to pick them off unawares. Throw a flare and watch them gather around it, then unleash a shot from your blade cannon, slicing them all in half. The possibilities are many. Dead Nation does a wonderful job of playing with your emotions, flooding your screen with myriad enemies only to return glimmers of hope with access to plenty of firepower. Its beautiful lighting and use of shadows tend to make things even scarier by regularly obscuring your view while cleverly hiding nearby enemies. You may clear a street and backtrack to explore, only to walk past a decrepit 18-wheeler, where you find yourself assailed by a new wave of enemies. All may be quiet following a 5 minute-long firefight, but then you find out that it was just the first of four waves of enemies in that area. Dead Nation isn't only about shredding the undead; it's about surviving the seemingly impossible. This very setup makes getting through each subsequent stage, whether on your own or with a friend, ever more satisfying. Making matters more dire, not all of the zombies you have to deal with are slow and dumb. Some of them run. Others take tons of damage to fell. And then there are the massive foes that can kill you in only one or two hits, enemies that can jump on top of you from across the screen, hulking zombies that can slice you in half with their sharpened arms, smaller, pesky zombies that can scream to call endless amounts of backup, and others that can shoot green liquid that stays on the ground, giving you nasty chemical burns. There's real diversity when it comes to Dead Nation's roster of enemies, and the further you get into the campaign, the more unexpected and dangerous the combination of zombies become. You'll often find that killing these stronger enemies is paramount, even if you're taking damage from the cannon fodder around you.  Evening things out a bit is Dead Nation's emphasis on upgrading and customization. Your standard assault rifle -- with unlimited ammunition -- will always be your fallback weapon, but eventually, you'll be able to add flamethrowers, rocket launchers, mines, and more to your arsenal. Better yet, each and every part of your arsenal can be upgraded using gold found during missions. Since not everything can be upgraded fully, you have to think carefully about how you spend your hard-earned loot. You'll also have to carefully consider how you equip the many pieces of armor you find, since speed, strength, and defense often come at the sake of one another. All of this boils down not only to one good playthrough of Dead Nation, but many. You can chase Trophies and high scores, of course -- Dead Nation is a master of the metagame, with intricate worldwide leaderboards and granular stat-keeping that pool player stats by country -- but it's also fun to up the difficulty level, focus on upgrading different kinds of weapons, all the while using various pieces of armor. You can even play with your friends locally or online, though I did have some hiccups while playing online, including a virtually unplayable mission alongside the one and only Greg Miller. Then again, when I played with someone else on a different day, everything ran just fine. If Dead Nation's exceptional five-to-seven hour campaign isn't satisfying your itch to slay hordes of zombies, then perhaps its bundled-in DLC will. I especially like Endless mode and its emphasis on providing greater and greater challenges. It's a great way to stay busy in between matches with your friends. Dead Nation on PlayStation 4 is just as great as it is on PlayStation 3. It's still eerie, difficult, and a ton of fun to play, whether online with your friends or on your own in a dimly-lit room. The extras thrown in to the Apocalypse Edition are just icing on an already delicious cake; but without these perks, Dead Nation is still one of PSN's stronger, more addictive games.
Jose Otero	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/25/towerfall-review	 TowerFall Ascension gets incredible mileage out of a simple but exhilarating four-player archery deathmatch formula. Each round unfolds at a frantic pace, and I was pushed to come up with clever bob and weave tactics that take advantage of the 2D map layout to avoid attacks and return fire. These colorful sprite graphics lend personality to the eight character skins, but are almost painfully primitive and depend on nostalgia for the early days of 2D platformers for appeal. That simplicity makes it especially surprising and fun when a screen-warping visual effect triggers mid-match to set off panicked reactions during battle. My friends often flailed and shouted trying to avoid incoming arrows, creating some of the most hilarious moments.   A big part of what keeps things feeling so fast is the finite ammo supply. You have just three arrows to start, and it’s balanced in a very smart way: every shot fired creates a risk-reward opportunity to gain the upper hand by gathering the wayward arrow before an enemy. And of course, the competition for power-ups is even more intense. But even if your quiver is empty, you’re not entirely defenseless – a well-timed forward dash into an oncoming arrow can pull it out of the air and into your ammo count. With a little skill, it’s a move that allows stunning reversals of fortune. That, or you die. This and other tricks, like firing an arrow through a candle to set it on fire, can give you a big advantage if you’re thinking about your position. Developer Matt Makes Games unfortunately didn’t include an online mode, and the single-player and co-op modes against waves of simple-minded enemies don’t stand out significantly except as practice. But TowerFall’s selection of match modifiers and over 120 maps allow you to tweak this couch-multiplayer game in fun ways that kept me and my friends playing and laughing for hours. TowerFall Ascension is a fun and approachable battle royale that makes excellent use of its deceptively simple retro looks and classic arcade platforming style. Every second is a mad scramble for ammo, powerups, and survival that, while sadly limited to local play only, kept my group of four players glued to their controllers with its highly competitive action. Even the single-player and co-op Quest mode is worth playing to practice your skills before going into battle.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/infamous-second-son-review	 Infamous: Second Son is, in many ways, a large step away from the comic-book roots of its predecessors. Don't misunderstand – Second Son is very much an open-world superhero action game first, and an excellent one at that. Its flashy powers look and feel great in battle, and that’s really what  games like this are all about. But I didn't expect to enjoy the weightier, more realistic tone of the characters as much as I do. It’s a change that initially surprised me as fan of the franchise, but one that ultimately pays off. Despite failing to believably marry the player's moral choices with the protagonist's own sense of right and wrong, Second Son hits some big high notes in both character interaction, and most importantly, open-world gameplay.   It didn’t take long for Second Son's remarkable lighting to leave me staring slack-jawed at my screen. The power of the PlayStation 4 is evident in every street-side puddle reflection and in every swirling tuft of smoke that left my flaming hands. The city of Seattle is beautifully and diversely realized, but it never looked better than when I was blowing everyone and everything around me to bits. Serene city streets turn into fiery disaster zones with gleeful regularity, and both the before and after are great to look at, despite occasional stutters when the effects get out of hand. While high production values are often a smokescreen for weak characters, Second Son succeeds here, too. Troy Baker’s motion-captured performance as our new Conduit, Delsin, remains believable whether he’s being a snarky, reckless jerk, or a plucky, bohemian do-gooder. He’s not universally likable, but the chemistry he has with his conservative, law-defending brother makes for some absorbing familial banter. Delsin is a young man who, like so many others, is filled with equal parts anger and idealism, and the fact that he wields such overwhelming destructive power makes that inner conflict tense, and interesting. Sure, it’s well-covered territory, but Baker imbues it with a charm, and youthful abandon that keeps it from feeling tropey or overwrought. Add in the icy, iron-willed villain Brooke Augustine, and the result is a conflict that boils to a genuinely affecting climax.  Sadly, the rest of the cast isn’t as well-utilized. Supporting characters like the immediately interesting Abigail “Fetch” Walker are quickly introduced and brushed aside, with limited involvement outside of the two or three-mission-long arc that pertains to them. While Second Son’s individual beats and characters are well executed, the plot that strings them all together is frustratingly straightforward and limited in scope, depriving the bit players of the chance to make a meaningful impact on the core conflict. Story quibbles aside, Infamous is about feeling formidable, and Second Son doesn't disappoint. Delsin’s four varied power sets turned every D.U.P. checkpoint into another chance to flex my super-powered muscles. From the explosive destruction of smoke to the swift precision of neon, each set feels strong enough to hang an entire game on, and strategically switching between them during  heated battles by draining power sources from around the city made me feel like an unstoppable force of nature.  Skill trees offer more options than previous Infamous games, allowing you to either concentrating on one power or split your resources between multiple paths, and the unlockable powers differ based on your moral alignment as well. An evil neon user for instance, can make targets explode into novas of pure energy, causing chain reactions that can obliterate groups of civilians in seconds, while a benevolent neon user can slow time to a crawl to carefully incapacitate foes one by one with a series of exacting attacks. Not only does this variety keep combat fresh, but it creates a strong incentive to replay and experiment with different combinations. The streets of Seattle are flush with random karma opportunities and predetermined side missions, so you never have to look far for an opportunity to put your powers to good (or not so good) use. Downing mobile D.U.P. command centers was a particularly rewarding venture, offering up some of the most steeply pitched firefights, and doling out big skill point rewards upon completion. I happily lost hours wandering around and taking the city back district by district, becoming ever more powerful as I went.  Between scraps, I found Delsin’s nearly unfettered sense of mobility exhilarating. He speeds up the sides of skyscrapers, and soars across the Seattle skyline at your whim...once you get all the right power-ups. Until then, you’ll be leaning on the old-fashioned parkour from the previous games, but it doesn’t feel nearly as sticky or reliable as it has in the past. This led to a few frustrating situations where I couldn’t grab ledges that were clearly in reach. It becomes less significant as you expand your suite of traversal powers, put when everything else feels and plays so well, it’s hard not to notice. Something that sticks out even more however, is the state of the morality system. The red vs blue decision making comes off as woefully outdated, and disconnected from Delsin’s personal motivation of healing his injured tribemates. There’s nothing in the story that suggests that he’d ever be interested in killing innocent civilians, or that his police officer brother would be okay with it if he did, and yet you’re clearly incentivized to murder everybody you see if you want to make the most of your evil playthrough. Extremism is always rewarded with more power, and as such, there’s never a reason to partake in evil actions when you’re trending good or vice versa. This essentially takes moral decision making out of the equation, which is sorely disappointing for a game that attempts to place choice front and center.  Open-world superhero action games are about freedom and empowerment, and in these regards, Second Son is really impressive. Seattle is a big, beautiful playground for you to stomp around in with a set of devilishly fun and powerful toys at your disposal. It plays great, and it looks even better, but its advancements also beg it to be held to a higher standard, one that its overall story and morality systems struggle to reach.
Andrew Hayward	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/06/basement-crawl-review	" Sometimes taking a chance on a low-priced indie game on the PlayStation 4’s section of the PSN Store can lead to discovering great things. Other times, it’s a waste of $10 like Basement Crawl, a hacked-together Bomberman knock-off that's lacking in both care and content and barely playable online. Developer Bloober Team's stinker starts off in impressively awkward fashion, thanks to a cinematic wherein we hear a sheltered child ask her overbearing grandmother about the outside world, followed by images of the four playable characters leering at a corpse outside a cellar door. It's the lone bit of plot in the entire game (hilariously confusing as it may be), and that absurd cutscene feels wholly disconnected from what follows: top-down, bomb-laying multiplayer battles across box-filled grids, surrounded only by drab menus.  Despite labeling its explosives as traps, Basement Crawl makes little effort to shake up the old Bomberman formula it copies, aside from the more realistic style of the environments and macabre character designs. Instead of charming cartoon heroes, we have a clown on a unicycle, a dismembered crash test dummy in a wheelchair, a blindfolded schoolgirl shouldering a knife-wielding teddy bear, and an obese woman wearing a gimp mask, bra, and camouflage pants. It's even less appealing a cast than when its inspiration tried to ""go mature"" with 2006's lame Bomberman: Act Zero. Of course, the best Bomberman games are still held in high esteem for very good reason: blowing up friends makes for an amazing party experience, and Basement Crawl offers the occasional taste of that. It's still fun to corner an enemy with a succession of traps, or kick a bomb down a lane and see the fiery finish swallow up a foe or two. The classic balance of strategy, speed, and reflexes is what Basement Crawl is all about, but it's significantly diminished by an undercooked and seriously bewildering interface. Often, it's not obvious where you've spawned on the dimly lit, shadow-drenched stages, nor is there any indicator that separates you from your competitors. Be prepared for a lot of cheap, confusing deaths as you struggle to discern where your character is located on the zoomed-out board. With no tutorial or even loading screen hints, it's unclear what each of the power-ups does, and the tiny icons aren't easily understood in the heat of battle. Learning Basement Crawl’s mechanics, pick-ups, and character perks means reading a static screen of text buried within the options menu. And with just four characters available – and no alternate costumes or palette swaps for eight-player online matches – things get very confusing quickly. If that were the extent of Basement Crawl's issues, it'd simply be a haphazard knock-off of a beloved favorite – uninspired and difficult to get a hang of, but still playable in the local four-player battles, despite only offering plain deathmatch and team deathmatch battles (with no modifier options to spice things up). However, with zero single-player content, you’ll probably want to turn to the online multiplayer for the lion's share of your playing time... and it's there that things really fall apart.  Basement Crawl simply fails to function online a large chunk of the time. Without matchmaking of any sort, you'll merely choose from a list of matches – and while I never struggled to find active battles, actually seeing gameplay was often a different story. Much of the time it hangs on an empty roster screen upon trying to join a match, and exiting out of this screen can take a minute or more to complete. Other times, I'd get to a loading screen only to wait for minutes and minutes. And when I did actually see a player-select screen, teasing me with the promise of online action, other mishaps would occur. In one match my character simply didn't spawn. Another time, none of the players spawned, and we all stared at an empty stage as the timer counted down. I also had a match immediately end, at which point my team was awarded the win; cue the ding of awarded Trophies for the most kills in a match (zero, like everyone else) and playing an online match without dying. There's nothing like a reward for a hard-earned victory, right? Basement Crawl is an utter mess online, which turns this otherwise-tepid clone into an early PlayStation 4 punch line. With just two modes, generic levels, a grating aesthetic, and an interface that damages the play experience, Basement Crawl would lack anything to keep us around even if it functioned soundly. But considering its severe online problems that effectively ruin half of this barebones affair, even desperate Bomberman die-hards itching for a modern fix should leave this rubbish hidden well out of sight."
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/13/dont-starve-ps4-review-2	 Don't Starve drives me mad like few games ever do. It provided me with dozens of exhilarating brushes with death, but padded those unforgettable moments with long stretches of tedious busy work. It's the type of game where you can spend hours mining the environment, outfitting your character, and fortifying your home base, only to have your slice of paradise shattered by a terrifying, nearly-unstoppable shadow beast invasion. It's a roguelike at heart, meaning that death is inevitable, and once you die, it's truly game over. Don't Starve will never, ever hold your hand, and I both love it and hate it for that.  Klei Entertainment's stylish take on Minecraft's formula through the lense of a roguelike drops you into the gorgeous wild and immediately abandons you to figure out how to survive on your own. Some adventurers will view this freedom as a liberating canvas on which they can express their patience, creativity, and bravery, but this complete lack of direction or goals beyond simply staying alive prevented me from ever really bonding with Don't Starve. I was charmed, though. The moment I landed in my randomly generated world I was struck by an immense appreciation for the paper-cutout graphical style and whimsical presentation. Like a pop-up book from the mind of Tim Burton, the gothic-inspired look makes even the most benign shrubbery seem threatening. This atmosphere of a child's storybook gone awry is aided by a menu system that feels like it’s ripped from the pages of children’s book and comically blunt bits of story. The visuals are accompanied by a carnivalesque soundtrack that, while immediately catchy, lacks any sort of variation and quickly led me to switch it off and search for my own creepy music to play in the background. The gameplay cycle is simple: explore the world and gather materials during the relative safety of daylight, survive the night by crafting a fire and consuming some food, repeat. And while there's a fair amount of mundanity associated with that, those efforts culminate in desperate and tense struggles for survival. In one game I found myself low on supplies and pursued through the woods by a horde of vicious spiders. Realizing there was little hope for escape, I threw caution to the wind and set a nearby tree on fire. Frighteningly quickly, the entire forest went up in flames, and my attackers were all reduced to piles of silk... which I picked up and used to make a vest.  Of course, a few minutes later my sanity meter drained due to my character's exhaustion, and my weakness gave a laughably weak frog the perfect opportunity to chisel the rest of my health away. It was a fair death – I could've prevented it by doing more mentally stimulating activities like crafting science items such as lightning rods – but what bothered me about it is that I was left with nearly no recognition from Don't Starve itself. No meta-progression, no leaderboard score, nothing but the story I just told you. You do unlock a handful of interesting characters with unique inherent abilities, and experience is its own reward, but it'd be nice to have something else to show for it. Don’t Starve is heavy on the resource management and crafting, so you’ll be spending quite a bit of time sifting through a wealth of menus. Navigating through Don’t Starve’s many options using the DualShock 4 is handled well, but still has a few hiccups. It still takes a bit of time to adjust to using the shoulder buttons to pop out a menu, the analogue sticks to navigate it, and the d-pad to eventually use a specific item. Think of any of Konami’s Metal Gear Solid games, and you get the gist of it. Unfair deaths do happen, and some of mine had to do with not being able to pick up a life-saving object that was right in front of me. While the 3/4ths overhead perspective helps show off the gorgeous art and makes the world feel like a living, breathing diorama, it also creates frustrating moments when items are hidden directly behind pieces of the environment. The thing about forests is that there are lots of trees in them, and there's often times no angle from which an item becomes selectable. When running low on health and chased by one of the world's many creatures, this hiccup becomes the difference between life and another 30 minutes of repetitive scrounging. While you can easily whip the camera around 90 degrees at a time, dense forests don’t get any less dense when viewed from the side.  The only real breaks in the cycle are bits of more focused challenges in the form of portals scattered throughout the environment that transport you to smaller, mission-based adventures. Don’t Starve’s Adventure Mode is great to go through once, and provides a genuinely interesting story with some dark character development and an interestingly macabre twist at the end. But once you complete the seven bits of campaign, you’ll find little reason to take another trip into Adventure Mode. Thankfully, you have the ability to modify many facets of the world before you begin a game, including inclimate weather, the abundance of crops, and the amount of enemies throughout the world. The Default Plus mode in particular helps by allowing you to pop into a more difficult world with immediate access to a wealth of items, which means that your game contains tension right from the get-go. Like most roguelikes, progress in Don't Starve oftentimes feels like a Sisyphean task. Time spent battling shadow creatures, building a farm, and ultimately, an inevitable death are rewarding once they get going, but failure to recognize success robs them of meaning. While I appreciate the world, atmosphere, and mechanics, I can't help but wish that there was a light at the end of Don't Starve's dark and lonely tunnel.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/16/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-freedom-cry-review	 One of my biggest complaints with Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag was that I rarely actually cared about Edward's story as I sailed across the Caribbean. Well, I'm happy to say that the Freedom Cry DLC tells the emotional story of Adewale, Edward Kenway's one-time first mate, as it dives into some heavy, powerful themes of slavery and the true price of freedom. Adewale's life is very different from that of any other AC protagonist, which makes his journey quite refreshing. But ironically, the thing I liked most about Black Flag – the sheer freedom of exploration – is nowhere to be found in Adewale's journey. Instead, Freedom Cry disappointingly uses the series' mission tropes as a crutch, and even goes as far as to roll back on some of the improvements that Black Flag proper made.    Adewale's mission to liberate the slaves of Port-au-Prince while attempting to spark a revolution is as engrossing a tale as the series has seen since Ezio's trilogy. There's some real humanity in this journey, and it manages to hit notes that resonated quite deeply with me. Experiencing the new sights and sounds of Port-au-Prince was great, as the city has a unique feel compared to the main hubs of Black Flag. Sure, the villain is a two-dimensionally evil governor who revels in the misery of his subjects, but that made me want to throw a wrench in his plans all the more. Freedom Cry wisely integrates its story themes with the actual gameplay. Most of the sidequests and diversions you'll stumble across involve saving the life of another human being. No matter if it's a runaway being hunted down, a pair of disobedient slaves being whipped, or the auctioning off of a family, I always felt an intense moral pang to stop what I was doing and step in to right these horrors. It might be a bit unsubtle on Ubisoft's part, but I felt compelled to continue liberating slaves and adding members to my growing resistance. My main gripe with the liberation mechanics of Freedom Cry is that they don't  ultimately pay off in a rewarding way. As I watched my resistance movement slowly grow, I kept expecting the number to eventually come into play in some sort of massive revolution mission where we overthrow the island's corrupt leaders. Sadly, the men and women you save only seem to exist to help you unlock character upgrades at predetermined intervals. I quickly realized that I wasn't saving them for the upgrades -- I was saving them for me.    Despite Freedom Cry's much-improved story and dense setting, it still stumbles over the problems that have plagued the series since its beginning, and even some that seemed to have fixed. Black Flag managed to combat the fatigue of Assassin’s Creed’s repetitive tail-and-stab missions by allowing us to freely explore a massive world and create our own adventures. But Freedom Cry's relatively compact map confines us to the main story. There are few distractions in the world, and it only took me an extra hour to see most of what the West Indies has to offer. In a story so heavily wrapped around the concept of freedom, I was sad to find that I had little choice in how my adventure would play out. I don't want to sound too down on Freedom Cry, because I really did enjoy my time in this Assassin's Creed short. Adewale's weapon of choice, a massive machete, lends itself to the heavy, violent tones of the story. And the score is particularly impressive, as it effectively hops between epic battle themes and Haitian folk music that really help make Port-au-Prince feel like a lived-in world. For better or worse, Freedom Cry feels like an entire Assassin's Creed game distilled into five hours. That’s good, but it’s an Assassin’s Creed game that doesn’t include many of the steps forward that Black Flag so recently made. I couldn't help but leave disappointed by the bland missions and ironic loss of freedom, which is definitely a bummer. But despite this, Adewale's journey genuinely moved me, as it dealt with themes and situations rarely explored in video games. A story unfettered by Assassin versus Templar mysticism keeps it grounded and powerful.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/12/doki-doki-universe-review	 HumaNature’s Doki-Doki Universe stands-out as something different. It doesn’t revolve around shooting guns, or swinging swords, or talking trash to your friends online, and this in and of itself is incredibly refreshing. Instead, it focuses on simulating personal interactions in a way I’ve never seen before while employing personality tests to tailor the experience. But there’s a catch: while Doki-Doki Universe almost exclusively hits unique notes, if often harps on them to the point of exhaustion. It makes what at first comes off as something so appealing and different lose its otherwise well-deserved luster. There’s an inherent charm embedded in just about every character, interaction, and location in Doki-Doki Universe. Its protagonist, QT3, is a hapless robot abandoned by his owners on a small planet and left waiting for them to return for decades. A phallic-looking green creature, Alien Jeff, finds QT3 (and his only friend, a red balloon) waiting patiently for their return and convinces him to explore the galactic neighborhood surrounding him. With planets big and small, as well as tiny bodies like asteroids, Doki provides a lot of unique locales to explore. Each planet – and those planets’ inhabitants – all share the same appealing art design, one that’s both simple and colorful. Consoling a snowman. Upon landing on a planet, QT3 is typically briefed by Alien Jeff about what’s going on around him before leaving him to his own devices. That’s because there’s something special about each planet and its native population, something designed to teach QT3 – and us, in turn – about the nature of humanity and ourselves. Distrust, greed, and even our propensity to pollute the environment are just some of the issues Doki-Doki Universe tackles, sometimes suitably and subtly, other times with a heavy hand that conflicts with its cute presentation and light-hearted humor. Doki’s gameplay largely revolves around completing what are, in essence, scores and scores of quick side quests for the inhabitants of each planet. None of these quests bend the mind or come toting any abstractness; indeed, if anything, Doki-Doki Universe is outright simple. Using in-game items called Summonables, QT3 can help those around him by giving each person and creature he meets exactly what they want. Likewise, he can scare or hurt these very same entities by giving them what they hate.  For example, one guy you meet might want something hot to eat. You may have found a Summonable from an earlier side quest that gave you a bowl of spaghetti. By calling it forward out of your Summonable list, you can satiate his hunger. But if you give him something to eat that’s cold – like a salad – he won’t take it. Successfully feeding him exactly what he’s looking for will, in turn, give you another Summonable which can no doubt be used in a future task. In many ways, Doki-Doki Universe invokes shades of Scribblenauts, and even David Crane’s A Boy and His Blob, with its emphasis on using items – and your imagination – to alter your environment while likewise affecting those inhabiting it. Doki isn’t about challenge, but about helping out those around you, learning more about their likes and dislikes, building your in-game level, and strengthening your collection of precious Summonables. Unfortunately, all of this does tend to become repetitive, because even though the Summonables themselves are varied, the act of using them is identical. There’s such little variety of types of things to do, and ways in which you execute those tasks, that it can’t sustain a 10-hour game. Further frustrations tend to mount when characters give QT3 vague clues about what they want, or don’t accept things that seem to fit the right bill. One such person on a planet I ventured to early on wanted something cute that lives underwater. Naturally, the fish bones I tried to give him didn’t work, but neither did a glistening goldfish, dancing sea creatures, or just about anything else. Likewise, Doki will occasionally “backfire” on you when you select a Summonable, summoning something you didn’t want. I thought at first I’d done something wrong, but no, that’s supposed to happen. Why the designers thought that was a good idea is beyond me, since it comes off as nothing more than arbitrarily manufactured frustration. You know, that's a really good question. The greatest piece of Doki-Doki Universe, however – and something that helps redeem it from its pitfalls – is its completely abstract, over-the-top personality tests. They’re shockingly on-point. By taking tests that never, ever ask straight-forward questions, Doki figured out that I like strategy, prefer plot over emotion in fiction, dislike being around kids, and enjoy efficiency in my everyday life. What’s amazing is that this information – which anyone who knows me would deem quite accurate – was garnered by asking me questions like which robot I’d like to hang out with, which airplane I’d like to fly, or what I think one cartoon is saying to another. I absolutely loved this aspect of the experience, even if it did “miss” in accuracy every so often. As a nice gift to players, Doki-Doki Universe’s three iterations – on PS3, PS4, and Vita – all come in one bundle, so if you buy one, you get the other two free of charge (even with its touch controls, the Vita version runs poorly and is the weakest of the three). Then again, Doki is also fairly overt in its attempt to get you to buy its plentiful DLC from within its interplanetary navigation menu. There’s plenty of content here, so it’s not like I felt shorted, but it’s offputting to get a sales pitch while playing. Doki-Doki Universe’s heart is in a great place, and its charm and startlingly accurate personality analysis provide a completely novel experience the likes of which I’ve never seen before. Its slant on side quests and completionism did, at first, scratch an itch for me, but Doki soon suffers from its sheer repetition, especially because it lacks any sort of tangible challenge. Doki-Doki Universe began to stumble from exceptional to acceptable as the hours wore on.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	 Make your own fun. This was once the mantra of the creative kid in the boring backyard; now it’s a pitch well-suited for Warframe. There’s nothing openly exciting about where its repetitive mission designs take you, but the huge variety of weapons, powers, and combat suits lets your creativity open up the battlefield to fun experimentation — that is, if you’re willing to pay. Warframe is a free-to-play, third-person, co-op shooter in the vein of Mass Effect 3 multiplayer, but with approximately 250 percent more ninjas wearing sci-fi suits (the titular warframes). The starter suits offer plenty of variety right from the get-go: one, Excalibur, is a well-balanced set that’s a good starting point for beginners. Another, the Loki set, lets you trick enemies with decoys and turn invisible in an instant. It feels especially sneaky and manipulative in a rewarding way. Each of these suits function as entirely different characters, and each is fun and challenging to play with.  So, these sleek, awesome warframe-ninjas you play as? They fight mean aliens. That’s about as deep as the story dives, unfortunately. Relative to other co-op centric shooters like Left 4 Dead and Borderlands that use characters and humor so well, something important feels missing. But of course, that doesn’t really reduce the effectiveness of Warframe’s action-heavy gameplay, or the pleasure that comes from slicing and shooting its variety of faceless and disposable enemies, including riflemen, shield carriers, and napalm launchers. Why am I killing these guys? Who cares. Now excuse me while I power-slide down a hill, flip into the air, and fire an arrow into a dude’s head before I land. The most glaring issue I faced as a new player is that Warframe doesn’t explain things well enough. Suits need to be modded with abilities, but the menus are unintuitive. Sometimes slotting a new power works fine, but other times the screen flashes red but doesn’t tell you what’s wrong. The interstellar mission-select screen is also unhelpful, as it doesn’t show you at a glance which planets have missions that are unlocked and ready for you to begin, forcing you to click on each one to track them down. It also doesn’t put much care into making missions feel distinct. They include the following: killing things and then blow up a reactor, killing things and then rescuing a person, killing things and then killing a boss, etc. Point is, though they’re different in name, most of Warframe’s dozens of levels feel exactly the same. Follow the dot on the minimap, shoot or stab the things that reside there, and then keep going. However, because the combat is so much fun I didn’t mind replaying levels multiple times to conquer them in different ways.  With a party of four players, it’s wise to think about team composition – especially in more difficult stages. Like in most MMORPGs, a healer and a front-line tank prove essential for most hectic fights. Cutting through hordes of enemies with a well-rounded team is fast, fun and satisfying. Playing a level alone, meanwhile, is a big change of pace. Because you take a massive cut in firepower, it’s more important to earn stealth kills and avoid alarms. I played through one area crouched with a bow and a glaive, then I played it again with a shotgun and fiery area attacks. You have complete control over the pacing of combat, which feels welcome and invigorating in a shooter. The biggest draw of Warframe lies in using the variety of suits, weapons, and other gear. This introduces a huge caveat – Warframe is a free-to-play game, and its in-game purchases can get very, very expensive. There are over a dozen warframes for sale, as well as dozens of other weapons, drones, and modifications. If you want a small selection of characters and only a few weapons to swap between them, you’ll end up dropping a full $60 on Warframe in no time. The in-game currency is earned too slowly to be rewarding; after four hours of play I was still at level one and I hadn’t accrued enough money to buy even the cheapest of suits. Rewards earned from playing normally feel purposely stunted, and it’s very disappointing for a game that could’ve kept me hooked long enough to fall in love with it (and throw money at it) with a little enticement.   The store itself could also be more transparent. For example, I bought a sniper rifle with real money. When I used it in a game, the reticle was so full of lines, dots, and other crap that I could hardly see what I was supposed to shoot. A preview option would've been handy, especially when things are so expensive. Warframe tips the scales too far in one direction. The core gameplay, including the variety of suits and weapons, is terrific, and it’s reason enough to play this sci-fi shooter. But the boring story, too-similar missions, and aggressive payment model hold it back from what it could be. Still, if you plan to pick it up, it’s worth dropping $60 and pretend there’s nothing else to it.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/escape-plan-ps4-review	 I had really high hopes for Escape Plan. After seeing it introduced at Gamescom in Germany in 2011 and being one of the very first people outside of Sony and developer Fun Bits Interactive to play it, I quickly realized the incredible potential of the game. Needless to say, it turned out well. As such, would-be PlayStation 4 owners and skeptical gamers alike may have heard about Escape Plan since it launched on Vita nearly two years ago. A puzzler oozing with quirkiness, charm and style, my time with the PS4 port likewise proved to be quite fun. But Escape Plan also finds itself saddled with a handful of problems that hold it back from what it could have been -- namely some finicky controls -- even if the transition from Vita’s touch screen to PS4’s DualShock 4 is surprisingly well-executed.  What's most noticeable about Escape Plan is its beautiful black-and-white graphics. With the exception of some red in the logo, you'll see nothing but grayscale anywhere else in the entire game. Main characters Lil and Laarg are an adorable tandem that really pop and stick out. In fact, the entire game can easily be described as gorgeous, with a special attention paid to a unique aesthetic that contributes greatly to the overall feel. Complementing the art style is an almost ironic classical music score and other sonic accompaniment, including laugh, gasp and clap tracks pulled straight out of your favorite '80s sitcom. Escape Plan revolves around the aforementioned Lil and Laarg, two characters with different body builds who are attempting to flee from the evil clutches of the devious mastermind named Bakuki. Our two heroes hatch their escape plans over and over again throughout 78 rooms. Each room is its own puzzle, and the puzzles themselves are strewn across four different environments that all admittedly look the same as one another. Expect to die often in Escape Plan; death is actually considered instructive, though, because you'll know exactly what you did wrong so you don't do it again. Then again, the game does tease you by cleverly (and maniacally) putting the number of times each character dies directly on their chest. Y'know, just so you don't forget. Most of the puzzles have one single idea behind them, though various solutions can be found in certain situations. On Vita, Escape Plan is controlled largely by touch, but that’s obviously not possible on PS4. Thankfully, DualShock 4 makes for an excellent replacement, with an all-new cursor controlled by analog stick, and various functions once relegated to Vita’s front and back touch pads mapped to R2, X, and more. I was skeptical about how a game so obviously made for Vita would port to PS4, but it’s just as solid on console as it is on handheld. Still, it shares some of the same problems as the Vita version, mainly in the form of various controls that don't always work consistently. Each puzzle is solved when Lil and/or Laarg successfully leaves the room in question without perishing. But just how do the puzzles themselves play out? Well, one puzzle might have you tap a coffee machine to have Lil drink out of it, thus giving him super speed and the ability to dodge danger with his quickness. Another puzzle might have you insert Laarg into a bubble and then control him by swiping on the front touch pad while avoiding razor blades and spikes. Laarg is taking a ride. There's great variety in the puzzles -- from simple and clean to long and complicated -- though certain conventions are reused as the campaign goes on. Still, completing puzzles, progressing further into the quest, and earning the coveted perfect three-star rating is exceptionally rewarding, though how long it'll take to beat is wholly based on your skill level. Expect to spend at least three or four hours with Escape Plan at minimum. Escape Plan absolutely reeks of nonsense and humor, which is exactly what you'd expect from a team partially comprised of the squad that brought PlayStation Network gamers Fat Princess. Appropriately priced for PS4 (and completely free-of-charge if you already own it on Vita, with a separate Trophy list to boot), Escape Plan is a worthy purchase, especially if you're looking for a pick-up-and-play game that can be digested very slowly, one morsel at a time. I just hope Fun Bits Interactive gets a crack at a sequel one day, because Escape Plan could use a few control fixes, and can easily be better than just great.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/03/tiny-brains-review	 There are few things more frustrating in a puzzle game than figuring out a solution to an obstacle, only to find yourself fighting with cumbersome controls and unpredictable physics when you’re ready to move forward. This happened to me far too often during my time with Tiny Brains, an indie puzzler for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4 and PC. Its few really neat ideas are suffocated beneath finicky mechanics, uninspired and recycled challenges, a drab visual style, and long stretches of frustration. Even played in multiplayer as it’s obviously intended, Tiny Brains isn’t good – and it's even worse when you're playing alone.    The basic premise of Tiny Brains has a lot of potential: a group of four endearingly ugly critters who’ve been experimented on to the point of developing superpowers escapes their mad scientist captor. One can create blocks, a pair can Force push or pull objects, and the other one can swap places with anything in the environment. Each of the powers are great on paper, but stumble in execution. Most challenges revolve around going from point A to point B, with the occasional switch that needs to be pressed. Looking at a puzzle, I’d often quickly realize that I could solve it by, for example, creating a block with one character, pushing it across a chasm with another, and swapping places with it at the exact right moment with the third. Easy, right? The problem here is that the crappy tools and graphical hiccups seemed to actively work against me as I tried to execute that solution. Trying to highlight a specific object that you need to swap with on the other side of a room is tough thanks to the incredibly fussy aiming system. Using your push and pull abilities to roll a ball across a room filled with chasms becomes a chore when you can't quite get a handle on the ball's inertia. And then there's the power to create a block, which is underutilized in the level design to the point where the poor guy who got stuck playing as that character feels useless for long stretches of the multiplayer campaign. Tiny Brains occasionally tosses an arena battle into the mix, but these quickly grow tiresome once you realize the quickest way to dispatch enemies and repeat it constantly for easy success. And aside from the main campaign, there are only a handful of challenge rooms where your team has to solve tough puzzles quickly, try to keep an object safe in a dangerous room, or play soccer against each other. These are completely forgettable diversions that serve little purpose beyond padding out the menu.   Tiny Brains is even more infuriating when you attempt to solve its incredibly linear two-and-a-half-hour campaign by yourself. You have to hot-swap between the four creatures, and seeing as how most puzzles require at least three different abilities to solve, you’ll be doing a hell of a lot of swapping. Messing up while juggle characters only enhances that lingering frustration of trying to complete a puzzle after you've already solved it in your head.  The best moments I had with Tiny Brains involved four people yelling at one another, gesturing toward areas of the television, and ultimately cheering in joy once we managed to physically solve a puzzle that we’d mentally conquered a few minutes back. These specific instances brought back fond memories of local multiplayer during the Nintendo 64-era – a time in gaming that  I'd love to see more hearkened back to more often. Just... in a better game. But while I have the luxury of working in an office full of PS4 controllers, I imagine many early adopters will have a tough time wrangling up the four controllers that are needed to experience Tiny Brains at its best. Obviously, it's a bit easier to find four controllers for the PC ir PS3 version. And though it does have an online mode, not being in the same room removes that chaotic fun, leaving you with just more frustration. There’s a great idea at the core of Tiny Brains. When it works, having four people sitting on a single sofa and working together to solve a tricky puzzle provides a great moment of local comradely that’s sorely lacking from modern gaming. Sadly, those moments are way too few and far between, and only the most patient of people will be willing to wade through the rest of the game in order to find them.
Chuck Osborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/dc-universe-online-review-2	 Calling all super-heroes! Nearly three years after its launch on PC and PlayStation 3, DC Universe Online is flying higher than ever. Now released on PlayStation 4, this action-packed online RPG has grown beefier, free-er, and sharper thanks to a modest graphics makeover. It’s still mostly the same game as it was when we first reviewed it, though, so if you weren’t a fan of grinding through legions of heroes and villains to gain experience, earn super-loot, and hang out with the likes of Superman and Wonder Woman, then this revamped edition may still leave you Captain Cold.   Getting started with DC Universe Online on PS4 is easy, especially if you’ve been playing on the PS3. It shares the same servers, so all you need to do is log in with your PSN account and your existing toons will follow. For newcomers, though, character creation is a comic fans dream come true. Designing a custom hero or villain from scratch or using an existing DC character as a template offers a dizzying array of possible combinations, naturally falling into the MMO roles of tank, controller, and healer. Be warned, though, that three years in, all the good hero and villain names have been taken so you may be stuck with adding numbers or being really creative.  Based on real-time combat instead of the auto-fighting that prevailed in older MMOs, DC Universe Online’s fun fighting system hasn’t changed much since launch. Expect to punch guys a lot in the beginning since your early powers tend to be less powerful than your fists. Character animations are stilted and the lack of variety in henchmen, cops, and goons can get a bit tiresome. The controls are practically identical to those on PS3, and it’s fairly easy to implement multiple powers using a combination of the shoulder bumpers and main buttons. As you level up, things get cooler as you add skills and powers from the expansive skill tree. Unfortunately, the progression trees can be too limited, and sometimes ask that you choose powers you don’t want or don’t make sense for your character’s backstory in order to get the one you actually want. Many of the story quests are personally assigned by DC’s iconic characters like Batman and Joker, which really makes you feel like an important part of this comic-book world and not just another guy in a cape. Open-world quests tend to be pretty grindy and monotonous, usually ordering you to collect or defeat a particular number of items or enemies. Much more interesting are instanced dungeon encounters that climax each story arc, in which you fight alongside superpowered elite like The Flash or take down major villains like Poison Ivy. Finishing all the main storyline content should cap out your character at level 30. If you’re mainly a solo player, there’s not much for you to do after that except to replay missions or restart a new character, but the more social-minded now have access to an excess of exciting endgame content like story-based raids, co-op encounters, and PvP battles that incorporate DC’s big-name characters.   DC Universe Online has grown in complexity thanks to a steady stream of updates and purchasable DLC packs. The new crafting system, which lets you create power-giving exobytes and slot them into your armor and equipment, is dead simple. That’s good, because beefing up your gear increases your Combat Rating; a high rating grants access to some of the most exciting top tier raids and encounters. This stick and carrot system is a powerful enticement to keep playing, even after you’ve maxed out your level cap. The Home Turf DLC lets you purchase and customize your own home base. Lairs are pretty useful in that its personal mainframe gives you access to sidekicks, supply drops, and more while out in the field. Not to mention that you can also invade other people’s lairs or defend yours in fun group raids.  One thing that isn’t new is the setting. DC Universe Online came out right before DC Comics’ New 52 reboot of its comic book line, meaning that Tim Drake is still Robin and Superman still wears his classic red trunks. It’s disappointing that the DC Universe itself has changed, and the game can’t change along with it, but doing so would probably be a major overhaul. In comic book lingo, I prefer to think of it as taking place on one of DC’s unspecified parallel Earths. DC Universe Online looks the best it ever has on PS4, and is definitely an improvement over the PS3 version’s chunkier, low-textured visuals. It has matured quite a bit since launch, adding much-needed elements like crafting, home bases, and more end-game content, but maintaining a level cap of 30 may put off those players who’d like to further advance their veteran characters or are primarily interested in soloing. That said, DC Universe Online is the best super-hero MMO out there and well worth the free download.
Vince Ingenito	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/injustice-gods-among-us-ultimate-edition-review	 The original release of Injustice: Gods Among Us delivers exactly the kind of glorious fights you’d expect from the DC Universe's mightiest, and makes them as fun and rewarding to watch as they are to play. While it buckled just a bit under the weight of all it was trying to do, it more than earned its spot on the shelves of fighting aficionados. Now NetherRealm has released Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition, collecting all the currently available DLC and sprucing it up for the PlayStation 4 and PC, and the result is…largely the same. Ultimate Edition looks and runs a bit nicer, but it doesn’t do anything substantial enough to warrant picking it up if you already own the original.  For its first trick, Injustice does something that few fighting games ever even attempt to do: tell an interesting story. What if Superman lost faith in humanity and, with his near-infinite power, decided it was time to stop protecting and start ruling? Without ruining anything, you've rarely seen Supes quite like this before. We've seen him “retire” in Kingdom Come, and watched him wreck shop whilst being mind-controlled a few billion times, but this is a far darker spin than all that. This isn't about a mopey alien who just wants somewhere to belong, it’s about a god who's decided his subjects no longer deserve free will. As heavy as it sounds, Injustice still finds time for the same kind of action, adventure, and humor that made the Justice League animated series such a treat. In fact, much of the original JL voice cast is in action here, including the inimitable Kevin Conroy as the Dark Knight himself and George Newbern as Superman. The story mode’s primary fault is that its reach exceeds its artist’s grasp. Closeups on main characters look good, but when the in-engine cutscenes attempt to depict clashing armies or sweeping cityscapes, bland textures and shoddily modeled buildings erode the visual impact a bit, and neither the PS4’s or PC’s beefier internals do nothing to change that fact. It's only because the in-fight graphics usually look so crisp that this dip in visual quality seems so stark, especially since the game is now running natively at 1080p/60fps. Outside of looking sharper and smoother, the move to next-gen hasn’t done much else in terms of effects or post-processing, resulting in a fighter that looks decidedly less impressive than say Killer Instinct. Ultimate Edition certainly isn’t ugly by any means, but even compared to other cross-generation titles, it only looks good rather than great. Despite this, it still manages to capture the godlike abilities of DC's finest. The cast is varied, interesting, and thankfully devoid of ninja lookalikes – more than I can say for Mortal Kombat 9 at its launch. NetherRealm took 24 characters, many of whom have never been seen in a video game, and translated their abilities and personas over beautifully. This is Injustice's greatest feat, and Ultimate Edition drives that home further by including the additional six characters that have come out since launch. There's reverence for the DC Universe in each menu screen and every matchup-specific line of dialogue.  So Injustice mostly stays faithful enough to its comic book roots, but how true does it stay to its Mortal Kombat ones? The short answer is: only as much as it needed too. All the best things about MK are present in spades. Beefy, high-impact hits that sound as brutal as they look, and long, satisfying juggle combos still abound, but so much more has changed for the better. Traditional direction-based blocking replaces the block button, making actual cross-ups possible. Throws are no longer a pure 50/50 mix-up like they are in MK9, thanks to a universal tech input. Combo breakers (renamed “clashes”) are only possible once per match now, and are part of a wider variety of useful ways to spend meter that make the decision to save it for an emergency a more meaningful one. This broadens the tactical possibilities for players at every level. Two other new systems help further differentiate Injustice from its ancestor. The subtler of the two is the character-power system. Each fighter possesses a unique mechanic based on their super-power that truly makes their style distinct. Solomon Grundy, for instance, gets a series of chain throws, each of which buffs a different attribute of his for the remainder of the match. The Flash, on the other hand, can call upon the Speed Force to effectively slow opponents to a crawl. NetherRealm got pretty creative with these, and learning how to leverage them properly adds another level of technical nuance and variety.  Also new, but potentially more troublesome, are the interactive environments. Each setting is jam-packed with heavy objects to pick up and throw, or bounce your opponent off of, and landing certain attacks at the right spots triggers a stage change, sending your enemy careening spectacularly through a series of obstacles. I have mixed feelings about these. Sure, it's badass when Doomsday backhands Superman clean through a pair of skyscrapers in downtown Metropolis... but when mere mortal heroes like Batman or Green Arrow do the same exact thing, it just looks plain silly. I'm not trying to go nerd police here, but such moments undermine all the effort that clearly went into making these characters move and play like you'd imagine they should. Between that, and animations that look great one moment and jerky the next, the illusion of two superheroes clashing can crumble at times. It never keeps the fighting from being fun, but Injustice is so effective when it maintains that spell that I hate to see it broken. Now, I'd be lying if I said all the wanton destruction wasn't great fun, because it totally is. However, I did have some balance concerns when Injustice originally launched. Environmental attacks are completely unblockable, and either shear off sizable chunks of life or leave you open to eat a full combo - and sometimes both. As the game has developed though, this has proven to be mostly a non-issue, with NetherRealm making a few small tweaks to tone them down a tad.  Finally, I'd be doing Injustice an injustice if I didn't mention just how much content is included. NetherRealm has once again spoiled us with things to do and a mountain of costumes, art, and music to unlock. STAR Labs is the new challenge tower, offering hundreds of fights to complete under special conditions. If you just feel like jumping into a series of matches, you can unlock and fight in a number of battle ladders, each with different stipulations like heroes only (no villains) or surviving on one health bar. Training mode has been significantly beefed up too, with frame data and detailed move descriptions built right in. Online lobbies have also improved, with the ability to bet XP on who will win the next match – and even issue challenges for how they'll win it. It helps keep lobbies fun and interactive, even when you're last in line to fight. Ultimate Edition augments this generous selection with new STAR Labs missions, some of which utilize the Dual Shock 4’s touch pad.   Much like the Vita port of Mortal Kombat, Injustice: Gods Among Us Ultimate Edition delivers almost the exact same experience as its console brethren. As is expected, slight graphical concessions have been made, but that little bit of lost sharpness around the edges is a fair trade for the silky-smooth performance, which is a lot more important in a fighting game anyway. Feature-wise, it's just as packed, save for the online lobbies, which are nowhere to be found. But the nice-sized roster, full-featured training mode, and oodles of single-player content are all present, giving you plenty to do when throwing down on the go. The Vita's D-pad is a great fit for fighting games, and while stick players will understandably struggle a bit, pad players like me shouldn't have any problems...so long as they stick with the default control layout. There's no option to map a button as a throw shortcut, so if your config of choice doesn't have light and heavy attacks set to adjacent buttons, throwing is a pain. It won't affect too many players, but it seems like an odd omission in an otherwise terrific port.  Injustice: Gods Among Us is an exciting, unique-feeling fighter at the beginner level, and a deeper, more interesting one at the advanced level. Story mode is a pleasant surprise, but the real reason to play is the thrill of harnessing the god-like powers of some of the most overwhelming figures in the comic realm. Ultimate Edition on PS4 and PC is the best-looking, most complete version you can buy right now, but if you already own Injustice on Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, there isn’t much reason to upgrade, especially if you already bought the DLC.
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/super-motherload-review	 As man looks towards the stars to begin lucrative mining operations in space at a faster rate than you might think, game designers here on Earth have crafted a product that has you doing just that. Super Motherload, from fledgling developer XGen Studios, sends us delving deep into the Martian surface to find precious minerals and gems to exchange for cold, hard cash. Indeed, the entire experience is predicated on a simple and repetitious – yet fairly engaging – premise, one that could prove to be addictive if not for Super Motherload’s unfortunate frustrations and maddening ending. Can you dig it? After selecting your character, you’re given a mining rover that can be used to dig ever deeper into Mars’ randomly generated red soil. It’s at this point that – from the very beginning -- you see virtually everything Super Motherload has to offer, from graphics to gameplay. And that’s okay, because on a mechanical level, it does what it does very well, even if it looks old and, on the periphery, quite unimpressive. Controlling your rover is simple, with movement mapped to either the directional pad or left analog stick, and digging is as simple as moving in the direction you want to excavate. The X button is used to float and fly back to areas above you, making sure you’re never stranded in the bowels of the planet. As you dig, you’ll encounter metals and precious gems of all kinds, from cheap silver and gold to pricey diamonds and rubies, which makes you want to keep digging, since the further down you get, the more common valuable rocks become. Bringing these back to service checkpoints, of which there are several as you move your way deeper and deeper, allows you to exchange your findings for money, which can then be used to upgrade your rover’s capabilities in fairly granular ways. You can increase your fuel capacity, better your drill bit, strengthen your armor, and much, much more. In this sense, Super Motherload has all of the trappings of something addictive, especially when you combine it with its rudimentary story – complete with passable voice acting – and pleasing soundtrack.  Unfortunately, though, Super Motherload becomes monotonous before very long. While there’s something intriguing about the experience -- something that caters to the OCD gamer in me that wants to dig up every last mineral and upgrade every little thing – it’s decidedly a one-trick pony. Digging down until your fuel is depleted, having to go back to the last station to refuel and deposit your findings, and then doing it all over again isn’t only the core of Super Motherload. It is Super Motherload. Things do get changed up a bit when you take into account your rover’s upgradeable smelter, which lets you combine minerals and gems to create more expensive items, explosives, and more. Likewise, finally passing through harder, more impervious soil types, rocks, and other materials that require better drill bits and bombs is strangely rewarding. But even with multiple characters’ rovers to upgrade, a few different endings to experience, and even local multiplayer to jump into, Super Motherload does very little to outright recommend it. Time to upgrade. And then there’s the last boss battle. Oh, that completely deflating last boss battle! For some reason, an arcade-style digging game culminates with a final encounter that borders on the infuriating. A six-to-eight hour campaign that revolves around doing the same thing over and over again suddenly decides it wants you to fight, and fight hard. And without spoiling anything, let’s just say that if you fail this battle, you’ll have to be prepared to delve thousands of digital feet back to the beginning of the battle while replenishing your supply of weapons and the money necessary to restore your craft to tiptop shape. For the little bursts of fun I had with Super Motherload, its last 10 minutes – which I had to play a dozen times before I completed it -- left a bad taste in my mouth. Out of all of the PlayStation 4’s launch games, Super Motherload may be the one least talked about, and there’s a reason for that. It’s a serviceable arcade game that provides its own share of fun, but it’s also repetitive – occasionally gratingly so – with a façade of robust customization options hiding the fact that we’re doing the same thing over and over again underneath. Outside of scratching that compulsive upgrade-cycle itch and a catchy soundtrack, it’s not really worth digging into.
Keza MacDonald	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/just-dance-2014-ps4-review	 I had wondered what new consoles could possibly bring to a series like Just Dance. It has evolved in complexity over time, adding a plethora of online and community features to the loud, fun tracklist and choreography that made its name, but this is hardly a technologically advanced game - so it's perhaps not surprising that the PS4 version is exactly the same as the PS3 version, save for the option to dance without the Move controller. It's actually lacking a few features present on Wii U, and with more than one person in the room the PS4's camera sometimes had a little trouble keeping track. It's still a lot of fun, of course, especially with the right people, but if you were expecting big changes, you'll be disappointed. If what you want from a dance game is instruction on how to become a better dancer, Just Dance is not the one for you. For that you probably want Dance Central’s detailed choreography breakdowns and practice moves. But as a party game, for me Just Dance wins out every time. It’s gloriously silly, colourful, riotous fun, and it has the magical power to make people want to dance before the usually mandatory two glasses of wine. Technically it’s never been the most accomplished dance game around, but it’s always been the most fun, and Just Dance 2014 continues its fine tradition of wonderfully outlandish costumes, easy-to-follow moves, and energetic personality whilst ramping up the production values and choice of modes. Track-list wise, Just Dance sticks closer to modern pop than any previous entry in the series – its 47-song list is dominated by the likes of One Direction, Katy Perry, Nicky Minaj and – finally – Lady Gaga, but there’s some ABBA, Village People, Bob Marley and, um, Daft Punk for variety. When Just Dance started off it couldn’t afford original songs, let alone original current songs, but now it’s bursting with them. There’s no way any of this stuff would make its way onto my iPod, as I’m tediously earnest in my musical taste, but it’s still fun to dance to.   It is, as ever, the choreography that makes Just Dance 2014. There are no motion-captured 3D models here – instead there are videos of real dancers, captured in all their vivacity and energy, inviting you to mirror their moves. It plays a clever psychological trick: because you’re following the moves like you’re looking in a mirror, it makes you feel like you might actually look like the professional dancer, even though what you actually look like (gifted dancers excluded) is a drunk person flailing at your TV in your living room, gut peeking ever so slightly over your trousers when you stretch your arms towards the ceiling. The routines – accessible, silly, and endearingly creative – regularly made me laugh out loud. It’s the songs designed for two, three, or four that really shine. There’s a Ghostbusters routine where one of you is Slimer, a Ke$ha song that has one person riding around on the other’s back for a while, three-person choreography for Careless Whisper, an I Kissed a Girl routine that is sure to lead to some epic house-party awkwardness, and ludicrous alternate mash-up versions for several songs where the most outlandish moves and costumes dwell. Costumes include a giant panda suit, a hippo head with a little bowler hat perched on top, a Gundam robot vs. a cat-eared anime girl, Russian hats, bouncing wigs, gold chains, sheer dresses, awesome bodysuits, and smart waistcoats with skinny ties. In The Summertime features four dancers dressed as giant pieces of fruit. It’s a party foul that some of the best stuff, including most of the On Stage choreography designed for three or four people, is hidden behind an unlock barrier; the more you dance, the more versions of songs you unlock, including Battle mode mashups. The On Stage versions are a particular reward – they cast one dancer as the star and the others as backing dancers, and provide a stage for particularly ostentatious dancers to shine. They’re also brimming with sexual tension, an essential element of any classic party game from Truth or Dare to Twister. One evening of dancing with friends was enough to unlock most of what we wanted, but nothing bums out a party like “Sorry, we can’t play that one yet.” The Just Sweat workout mode hasn’t changed much since Just Dance 2, but the online features have gotten better and better. There’s a constantly rolling global dance-off called the World Dancefloor that you can join at anytime, dancing along with everyone else in the world to a pre-determined tracklist. It’s good for alleviating the decision paralysis that comes with a track list this big, along with the Recommended suggestions that pop up on the menu screens. Just Dance 2014 has been out on Wii U, Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 for a while already, and this version is functionally no different - the Xbox One version, which we'll be reviewing as soon as we can get it, offers six-person dances, but this PS4 version doesn't. You can dance with up to four using the PS4's camera or Move controllers, but using just the camera is not advisable. It took several songs before we figured out a good position for the camera that stopped it from losing track of us mid-dance, and even then it often confused two people for one person or switched players around, making the scoring completely irrelevant. With the Move, it works better, but I was really hoping we wouldn't have to mess around with peripherals. The camera's issues make this the worst of the Just Dance 2014 versions, along with the Xbox 360. Without something in your hands the relationship between what your body is doing and what Just Dance is telling you feels even more disconnected.   This is a problem that Just Dance has always had: the relationship between what you’re doing and how it scores you is pretty loose. It makes for enthusiasm and positioning, but it’s hardly precise. In all honesty, though, who on Earth cares? Just Dance is better at getting people and dancing than anything since alcohol, and my friends at least aren’t serious enough dancers to get twitchy about the scoring system. You could sit there on the couch and twitch the Wii remote if you wanted, but what would be the point? It's disappointing that the PS4 version of Just Dance brings nothing new to the table, and that it doesn't work as well with just the camera as it does with the Move, but it's still a lot of fun.. It’s wildly silly, creative and colourful, relying on daft, characterful choreography and to evoke a party atmosphere that puts everyone at ease. There’s not a lot here that wasn’t in Just Dance 4, or even Just Dance 3, but the series’ talent for getting people up and dancing is still unmatched. Dancing is fun no matter what, but this game is a master facilitator of that fun, a catalyst for laughter.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/battlefield-4-ps4-review	" On PlayStation 4, Battlefield 4 suffers from a handful of irritating launch issues. The 1.50 firmware update caused a number of issues. The core gameplay is unaffected -- it's still great -- but limited servers, unreliable connectivity at press time is frustrating. It's been difficult to find any Conquest games, too. Additionally, Battlefield 4 has a hard time functioning properly with PSN. I crashed back to the PS4 home screen after a number of errors, as did many of my squad mates. If you're worried about not having the best possible experience with a great game, wait for Battlefield 4 to stabilize. When and if these problems are solved, we'll remove this disclaimer. We still believe Battlefield 4 is a great game, as you'll see in the review below, but be advised. DICE and EA have taken to delaying ""future projects"" as well as Battlefield 4's map expansions as a result of these issues. You can learn more about why here on IGN.   Battlefield 4 is a greatest hits album of DICE’s multiplayer first-person shooter legacy. It retains the defining DNA of Battlefield 1942, re-adopts Battlefield 2’s brilliant Commander mode, and exaggerates the destruction of Battlefield: Bad Company 2, all while embracing the realism, class reorganization, and gorgeous graphics of Battlefield 3. Most of the time, Battlefield’s unpredictable, vehicular-based competitive combat is predictably excellent. What I didn’t anticipate was DICE getting in its own way. What we've never seen before in a Battlefield game is the drastic, and often inconsistent way Battlefield 4 forces its two massive 32-player teams to adjust to evolving environmental conditions. A dam bursts, crushing everything below with metric tonnes of rubble and floods. Half a hotel disintegrates, exposing a control point and depriving snipers of a valuable perch. Large-scale destruction like this changes the fundamental layout of an area, forcing combatants to react intelligently and change their strategies and loadouts on the fly. Even after the magic and surprise is gone, teams always need to be prepared for how they’ll react when a crumbled tower keeps their tanks out of enemy territory. Coming out on top because your new strategy adapts to and harnesses the new level design is even more satisfying than the XP and armory unlocks you earn along the way.  That said, not every instance of awe-inspiring devastation is as excellent as these. Often, triggering the event takes minutes of work, and the result is sometimes superfluous, feeling more like DICE’s obligation to include it in every map rather than something that achieves anything of value. A smashed satellite at the center of a map becomes a minor inconvenience for vehicles, for example. A toppled tower actually makes it irritating to navigate an underground area, and manually detonating underground explosives from a terminal takes you away from the action in one of the biggest maps. Most offensive of all, a flooding town’s rising water levels significantly inhibits mobility – and is especially frustrating if you’re in a fierce tug-of-war for a base-busting bomb in the terrific new Obliteration mode. If you're smart about it, you can take advantage of most maps’ effects, though – including some of the less magnificent, more subtle things. Diminished visibility as a typhoon assaults an island might mean changing your favorite red-dot sight for something that sees in the dark. Hunting bomb carriers as the sun rises means they’re increasingly vulnerable as the match goes on – the faster they arm control points early on, the easier their lives will be later. In addition to those major destruction events, DICE has rediscovered a major factor that defines Battlefield’s greatness among other modern military shooters: finally, for the first time since Bad Company 2, teams can tear down most simple structures. Knocking out supports to topple houses and collapse roads isn’t quite as exciting as a skyscraper sinking into a bay, but it’s great for keeping enemies out of troublesome spots or creating a crawl space to hide in. One of my favorite maps – Golmud Railway, where DICE’s designers take expert advantage of its enormous scale, several scattered control points, and aerial warfare – has a mobile control point in the form of a train. Fighting for control is an entertaining, mobile struggle. More than anything, and despite its new features, Battlefield 4 most closely resembles Battlefield 3, if only for the similar feel of its physical, scary weapons. Accounting for bullet drop as a sniper – which involves more mental math now thanks to adjustable zero-targeting ranges – remains one of the most fulfilling things about Battlefield’s skill-based gunplay. Elsewhere, one of the smallest departures is the most significant, at least for knife-fighters. Stealth attacks from behind, as usual, guarantee a new set of dog tags for your knife-kill collection. Stabbing at someone from the front, however, gives them a brief opportunity to reverse the attack. Counter-kills are an incredibly satisfying way to put down someone who wasn’t careful enough to wait for you to turn your back, and an interesting new tactical layer to what used to be a panic button. Where Battlefield 4 most brilliantly distances Battlefield 3 is in its map design. The best Battlefield maps are challenging and satisfying, demanding you take advantage of everything at your disposal, and Battlefield 4 does this extremely well. Screaming across the terrain in the bouncy new off-road buggy is a blast, but its vulnerability may lead you to choose a tank instead. But even its rear is vulnerable to infantry rockets. Battlefield’s interesting relationship between infantry and vehicles goes deeper here, with additional means to take down enemies, whether you’re immobilizing vehicles or filling them with a team to attack in force. The soldiers in that ride will likely have a more varied array of gear than ever, too, because character classes and vehicles have more extensive customization options in Battlefield 4. Recon is no longer limited to the sniper/shotgunner role, allowing him to equip a mid-range DMR to do some actual recon. Classes are defined by gadgets rather than guns, and it permits a more aggressive play style for unit types previously restricted by their loadout options. Much like Battlefield 4’s gameplay, its customization is more liberated than ever.  Terrific level design is responsible for a lot of what makes this work well, and I’d wager that a good chunk of Battlefield 4’s maps will live as classics. Everything is, as always, engineered around Battlefield’s territory-control Conquest mode. Hainan Resort, with its destructible hotel centerpiece and terrific mix of air/ground/sea combat options, is Wake Island-levels of outstanding. Awesome opportunities exist for every class, every pilot, every aggressive paratrooper to pull off an unbelievable kill or anxiety-inducing control point capture. It's not the only excellent one. The Rogue Transmission map gives planes plenty of breathing room, and ATVs can avoid aerial vehicles using underground passageways. It’s a map that demands a sense of spatial awareness and having a reliable, coordinated squad. It’s also one of Battlefield’s best-in-class vehicular balancing acts – vulnerable four-wheelers can still escape tanks, which in turn have a great, unobstructed view for clearing the air of choppers and jets. Not every map works great with every mode, though. The thrill of punching through enemy lines, destroying control points, and proceeding to the next seems less strategic than ever in some Rush maps. Paracel Storm, for example, funnels attackers into punishing bottlenecks dominated by defenders. In others, predatory offense can feel like desperate brute force, particularly in matches with lots of players. Obliteration maps with water are the most troublesome – the mode’s bomb resets if it ends up in the drink, leading to chaotic confusion and frustrating losses.  Domination is a fast and focused Conquest variant with scaled-down maps and infantry-only fighting, which is a nice change of pace from the contemplative exploration of the open-ended Battlefield maps. In that sense, it’s closer to Call of Duty than Battlefield, for better or worse. Likewise, Defuse mode is a shameless Counter-Strike clone with a Battlefield twist. Planting a bomb behind enemy lines without respawning is even scarier when someone punches a hole through a wall with a rocket. Explosives and exposure don’t break it, mercifully, since the complex maps have so many routes to escape or flank foes. Operation Locker, a tight-quarters prison with winding hallways and plenty of places to flank enemies, always has me looking over my shoulder, and will find a dedicated Domination/Defuse audience, no doubt. Commander Mode brings out the best in Battlefield 4. When one player on each team steps away from their guns to issue orders from a top-down tactical screen to 31 teammates, amazing things can happen. It's hard to believe that participating war in a hands-off capacity can be this satisfying! Coordinated Commanders who work well with their squads will find themselves steamrolling enemies who can’t. The symbiotic relationship between soldier and Commander creates cyclical reward that enables new strategies in Conquest, Rush, and Obliteration, if you choose to use it. Commanders who send reinforcements to a suppressed squad, or send enemy-spotting UAVs overhead of hotspots, will earn the trust of a team. Squads who capture specialized control points earn additional attack options for their leader to deploy, such as a missile strike. Like in Battlefield 2, Commander Mode will change the way serious players play a Battlefield game. It is, more so than the sometimes-awesome evolution of landscapes, a reliably interesting feature that DICE should never let go of again.  Also difficult to fathom is how Battlefield 4’s campaign uses so much to accomplish so little. You might've seen the first 17-minute video that DICE released of Battlefield 4 gameplay, featuring a run through the first story mission: a frantic escape sequence in Azerbaijan. It’s a spectacular showcase of Frostbite 3 engine’s incredible technical capabilities, DICE’s skillful ability to build tension, and Battlefield’s prowess as a flexible sandbox shooter. It is also emblematic of Battlefield 4’s complete inability to restrain itself. Its campaign is an obnoxious assault of explosions, blood, profanity, and anger wrapped in an apparent parody of a first-person shooter. In five hours, Battlefield 4 hits on almost every predictable cliché expected: Tank mission, boat mission, stealth mission, jailbreak, sewers, sudden but inevitable betrayal, dastardly Russians, defying orders, and, of course, a torture sequence. Retreading thoroughly charted territory isn’t exciting here, and Battlefield 4 regularly squanders or underutilizes its fragmented strengths in designing those levels.  It introduces squad commands, allowing you to order teammates to attack, but it’s just that simple. Point, allies attack, and then you move on. Why aren’t they shooting at enemies like this in the first place? Level design is increasingly constrained as the campaign proceeds, and corridors and other tight spaces leave little room for options, team play, and the flexibility that we see flaunted in earlier, larger encounters. Spaces seem to shrink over time, and verticality is tossed aside in favor of forward-facing firefights. I’ll give it this: Battlefield 4’s single-player never quite sinks to the same level as Battlefield 3’s oppressive linearity, follow-the-leader structure, and borderline absence of interaction. It's also very pretty, and the stellar lighting, particle, physical, and environmental effects are impressive across the vibrant, visually diverse settings. But it’s a surface-level success where there isn’t much depth. Leveraging that realism, Battlefield 4 aims for an evocative, emotional experience, and utterly fails. I count its disjointed story among the least emotionally affecting experiences I’ve had with a game (that actually tried for one). Any plea for plausibility or depth dies when a bodycount milestone earns you a headshot bonus, weapon unlock, or gold medal pop-up. Between its unwillingness to put primary characters at serious risk and a meaningless moral-choice finale, Battlefield 4 pulls almost every emotional punch.  Meanwhile, the plot has too many moving parts and not enough time to give them each due credit. It’s unsure whether to focus on the suffering of your squad or the geopolitical gibberish. Writing is not Battlefield 4’s strong suit. Sometimes it fails to explain narrative progression clearly. Other times it’s awkward, out of place, and embarrassing. One of its most confusing story surprises is addressed with nonsensical blasé: “Things were f***ed. Then they were unf***ed.” When a secondary character doesn’t make it to the next scene, a squadmate pointlessly notes that the “dude is dead.” My personal favorite: “If you’ve survived a nuclear explosion like I have” is the actual start to a sentence someone says. Honestly, it feels like something is missing here. A gaping “Two Days Later” hole introduces sudden changes in character behavior and an out-of-nowhere new setting and to-do list. It’s as if half a campaign and the whole of its humanity got lost along the way. Battlefield 4 is an excellent multiplayer game that makes the most of its ambitions, proving once again that destruction is a valuable strategic addition to competitive combat, which reaches its full potential with two killer Commanders are bringing out the best in their squads. On the other hand, its single-player campaign is a disappointing, but a functioning and familiar game with overwhelming action and remarkable spectacle. Its PS4 launch problems aren't easily forgiven, what with the unreliable stability DICE is striving to fix, but because the core game is so strong, Battlefield 4 is worth either sticking with or waiting for."
Chuck Osborn	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/pinball-arcade-review	 Turn down the lights, put away your quarters, and plunge into Pinball Arcade. This is a totally authentic pinball simulator that serves up some of the best and most famous pinball tables from classic makers like Williams, Gottlieb, and Bally. New to PC and PS4, this sorta free-to-play edition is the best version of pinball you’re likely to play without setting foot inside a smoke-filled bar or lovingly polished collection.   Pinball Arcade includes one free table, Tales of the Arabian Nights, and it’s easy to see why it was chosen to demonstrate what this sim can do. Not only is it an exhilarating table with flashy effects and deep gameplay, but it’s also one of the most gorgeous tables that Pinball Arcade has to offer. Its richly hued intricate artwork on the playing field really pops on a 1080p screen. Even if you don’t get any more tables, Tales of the Arabian Nights alone is well worth the download.  But if you do decide to plunk down some coin for extra tables, which you can purchase a la carte or in series collections, the selection of tables includes some of my favorites of all time. For example, Funhouse - also known as “that one with the ventriloquist dummy head” - has never looked or played better. It’s still a rush to make Rudy the dummy fall asleep with his snoring mouth wide open, and then gag him with a ball after lining up the perfect skill shot.  There’s a wide assortment of memorable tables ranging from licensed tie-ins like Star Trek: The Next Generation, Twilight Zone, and Elvira and The Party Monsters to milestones for the genre like Black Hole, the first pinball game to charge 50 cents and feature an extra inverted playing field. For my money, though, the most spectacular continues to be Medieval Madness. Make sure you do what I do and toggle the in-game room light to low so you can really enjoy its amazing light effects. New tables are being added all the time based on public demand. The downside is that the assortment leans towards newer boards with lots of bells and whistles, and neglects vintage classics from the 50s, 60s, and 70s.   The PC version of Pinball Arcade looks good, but the PS4 looks downright stunning with nearly photo-realistic detail and flawless frame rate. The ball physics, flipper strength, and even plunger mechanics are exactly how you’d remember them from the arcades. This simulation is so detailed that there’s a “Call Attendant” option in case your ball ever gets stuck. In some ways, these tables look too pristine -- much better than you’re likely to see them in actual arcades.  The one flaw that affects almost every pinball sim is still on display here, though, and it’s that there never seems to be a perfect viewing perspective. You’re either too close, too far away, or part of the board is obscured. It doesn’t help that rendering a vertical board on a wide screen makes the table smaller. It’s definitely not a reason to skip Pinball Arcade, but is a reminder that there are some things a sim can’t duplicate. For pinball fanatics or just those curious about gaming’s relatively low-tech past, Pinball Arcade is an excellent starting point for re-experiencing the golden days of quarter-munchers. These tables have never looked better than they do on PS4, and the gameplay is authentic right down to the sound and pressure of each tables’ flippers. The first table’s free, so there’s no excuse; this is a must to download. (Pinball Arcade for PC is available now on Steam. The PS4 version will be released in December 2013.)
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	 If 2011 was the year Killzone found itself on the ropes, then 2013 is the year the franchise regains its footing. Killzone 3, released a couple of years ago on PlayStation 3, was considered by many to be a low point for the series, but earlier this year, Killzone: Mercenary on PS Vita set it back on the right course, and the PlayStation 4 launch game, Killzone: Shadow Fall, shows us an entirely new side of the franchise.   Shadow Fall goes a lot further than Mercenary in attempting to remedy some of what was wrong with the franchise, and developer Guerrilla Games has smartly (and obviously) studied its contemporaries in the shooter space for inspiration on how make its series excel again. The Dutch studio has created a Killzone game that feels, in some respects, like a reimagining of what its been endlessly working on since the PlayStation 2 era. It takes slivers of Halo, Call of Duty, Crysis, and Deus Ex to deliver something staggeringly different for Killzone, something longtime fans in particular may not expect.  Killzone has always been a bleak-looking game, a product of its equally bleak story surrounding two factions of warring humans, the Vektans and the Helghast, but Shadow Fall one makes a welcome turn for the colorful. It takes place decades after the catastrophic events at the end of Killzone 3, with the conflict between the two sides turning into a bona fide cold war as a result of once again living on the same planet. This story has allowed Guerrilla to explore different, more subtle themes, in turn letting the team flex its artistic muscles in ways it never had a chance to. This becomes immediately evident as soon as you begin the single-player campaign. The wake of endless war -- and the invasive industrial feel of previous entries -- have stepped aside for stunning, colorful cityscapes, lush forests, and abandoned space stations. Shadow Fall’s environments are gorgeous, diverse, and have a tangible feeling of scope, and it’s the pristineness of many of them that make them special. It’s easy to lose track of time staring off into Vekta City’s impressive skyline, or run around looking at the plant life in the forest alongside the wall that keeps the two sides away from one another. And while it doesn’t always run at or near 60 frames per second, Shadow Fall performs nicely, with motion blur slyly hiding some of its rough technical edges. More Must-See PS4 Launch Content: Also eliminated is one of the most well-known and divisive components of the franchise: its incredibly heavy-feeling movement. Mercifully, that mystifying sluggishness is long gone, making Shadow Fall faster and snappier than Killzone has ever been, making way for a shooter that feels, at its core, a lot more like Halo than Killzone 3. And though enemy AI is occasionally lacking, as Helghan foes at times don’t practice self-preservation or seem to even “turn on,” it’s normally up to par, and firing your weapons into them is a blast. So much so that I have to wonder why Guerrilla thought taking so long to put a gun into your hand and let you out of your tutorial-laden cage was a good idea. Uh-oh.   Once you’re out of that cage, you’ll get to explore a story that, like its aesthetic and feel, is also starkly different than what came before it. Unchained from the more conventional war between the Helghast and Vektans, Guerrilla has decided to explore a plot that’s full of cold war nuance. The uneasy peace between the two sides, split by a literal wall, evokes a heavy post-war Germany influence (much like the Helghast throughout the series rely heavily on a fascist, Nazi-like imagery). This means that big, open battlefields and endless arrays of gunfights are replaced with around 10 hours of more thoughtful, quieter missions that are interspersed with the setpiece battles I know, love, and expect. There’s even an attempt at stealth, though it doesn’t always work very well. You can sneak up behind enemies or fall on top of them unawares for a variety of violent knife kills, but these aren’t always executed as you intend, and it’s fairly common for what should have been an amazing flourish with your blade to turn into a decidedly unsubtle rifle-butt attack, inevitably alerting every other enemy in the area to your presence. The story itself is a bit muddled -- and even nonsensical at times -- but it’s the varied environments it allows you to explore that makes it palatable, if not outright enjoyable. As you jump between the Vektan and Helghan sides of the wall (and elsewhere), you’ll find yourself in all sorts of interesting places that a straightforward war scenario, like those found in previous Killzone games, wouldn’t allow for. It’s unlikely Killzone 2 or 3 would have had you running through a three-story townhouse rescuing hostages in the middle of a city totally unaware that anything bad was happening. But in Shadow Fall, that’s just another day at the office for your character, mysterious Shadow Marshal Lucas Kellen, someone capable of both killing and feeling, a twist for a Killzone protagonist.  There are interesting characters to meet (some better voice-acted than others), civilians to interact with, and a ton of story-driving collectibles to find. But the various degrees of non-linearity in each mission really is the hallmark of the single-player campaign. It, along with Shadow Fall’s new graphical flair, is what sets it apart from other Killzone games more than anything else, and represents a new chapter for the franchise. I absolutely adored how it often challenged me to go about things in different and unique ways, especially on certain maps where you can go in any direction you please. Early in the campaign, you find yourself on the Helghan side of the wall in a stunningly beautiful forest searching for the crew of a downed Vektan aircraft, but before you do, you can stray to the far side of the woods to take out the security station. If you’re seen, you could use your special robotic friend, OWL, to shut off alarms and stop reinforcements from coming, or you could simply shoot everybody in your way. There’s not only inherent strategy to be employed here; there’s inherent replayability, too. The aforementioned OWL – your airborne robotic companion – is the final trump card in Killzone’s repertoire. It can be dispatched to stun or outright attack enemies, it can deploy a shield to give ample protection from enemy fire, and it can even shoot out a zipline that allows access to platforms and other far away areas, giving Shadow Fall an unexpected – albeit underused – feeling of verticality. Get 'em, OWL! OWL’s more practical uses are ones that grate a bit as the adventure carries on, however. It’ll often be used to hack computers – time and time again – and it can also be used to apply adrenaline to you when you fall in battle, which is basically a fancy way of saying you’re being healed. The former becomes quite repetitive while the latter allows you to forego some of Shadow Fall’s more difficult parts. I often sacrificed myself with knowledge that OWL could revive me, and I’d begin anew without going back to the last checkpoint (and with time temporarily slowed down to give you an extra edge, to boot). But it’s another tool to use as you see fit, and it’s in these situations – when it’s really forcing you to think – that Shadow Fall shines most. It’s not a corridor-shooting Killzone game by any stretch of the imagination, and while combat truly is a lot of fun – complemented by a great variety of firearms – it’s the quieter, more somber moments that are most memorable. Unfortunately, it’s occasionally cluttered by some pesky missions that made me do things I really don’t want to do – like hacking and remotely controlling spider-like robots or identifying remote targets for an ally to take out – but when Shadow Fall gets down to brass tacks and focuses on what it does best, it provides an utterly satisfying experience. Then again, there are those times where Shadow Fall absolutely insists on doing things it’s just not very good at. Virtually all of these moments happen when you don’t have a gun in your hand, when Guerrilla forcibly shows off its impressive graphics or changes things up for the sake of changing things up. There are strange zero-gravity sections, even stranger areas where you’re free-falling, and a few times where you have to jump around and platform. These scattered sections all share one thing in common: they’re bad. They don’t control well, they aren’t fun, and they break up what is otherwise a fun single-player campaign, one that’s already broken up enough with pretty story scenes.    When you’ve finished with Shadow Fall’s campaign, its strong multiplayer modes are a good reason to stick around. I had a blast experimenting with new loadouts and learning the 10 large and diverse maps that revisit indoor and outdoor areas from the campaign, and I was impressed by the variety of modes. Like in Killzone 2 and 3, Warzones – roving game modes that occur on the fly so that you don’t get brought back to a lobby with any regularity – are the name of the game here, though you can play individual modes if you so desire. There’s an almost insane level of granularity in terms of weapon selections and loadouts, skills, attachments, and the like, and interestingly, it all comes under the guise of multiplayer that’s far more accessible than the Killzone games on PlayStation 3. By abandoning experience-driven level progression for a new multiplayer metagame surrounding Challenges, Killzone becomes more about the application of skill than the unlocking of stronger, newer, and better loadouts. Indeed, just about every weapon for all three multiplayer classes are unlocked from the get-go, stressing proficiency above all else. I enjoyed playing with tailor-made Warzones, and equally enjoyed taking the time to create my own. One Warzone I played on during my session required us to use nothing but sniper rifles and knives, with only one life to live. The Warzone I crafted myself brought it to an even more difficult level, with only one type of pistol accessible, and slowly refilling health. It's awesome how intricate you can get in the creation of custom Warzones. Shadow Fall's most beautiful map. Shadow Fall’s roster of locations is pleasantly diverse. I especially loved the rain-soaked nighttime map and, of course, the forested level with a ton of sniper perches and distressingly few places to hide. The three character classes also provide a subtle, additional level of depth, though success rests much more with the weapons and skills you opt to equip than the class you choose. Still, there are fewer classes to choose from when comparing Shadow Fall to Killzone 2 and 3, and some players may pine for the intricacies of earned Ribbons, Badges, and the like found in those games. Interestingly, Guerrilla intends on supporting Shadow Fall with free new maps well into the future, seemingly promising a vibrant online community for some time to go. But multiplayer’s real longevity will come by way of those aforementioned Warzones, where you can rewrite the rules as you please. Being able to affect and alter every little thing about Killzone: Shadow Fall’s online experience truly is the crux of it all. And that’s a good thing. Shadow Fall represents the Killzone series’ coming-out party – out from being a plodding, gray war shooter through hours of bland, linear corridors. Now, it’s something else entirely. Its single-player campaign suffers from some AI issues and dabbling in non-shooter gameplay it’s just not good at, but it’s still an enjoyable romp that challenges you to really think about how you’re approaching each fight. And then there’s multiplayer, as hardcore as ever but with a level of accessibility that will allow Killzone’s online community to grow and flourish for some time to come. There’s never been a better time for everyone to be paying attention to the Killzone franchise, because Shadow Fall is a step in an all-new, very welcome direction.
Steve Butts	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	 Like Skylanders or Traveler's Tales LEGO games, Knack is a fairly straight-ahead brawler with a visual charm that will appeal to younger gamers. As you dig into its design, you'll initially be wowed by the prospect of Knack's promise of changing the main character's scale. Moving from tiny Knack to big Knack as you progress through the levels adds a wonderful sense of scale. Unfortunately, none of Knack's strengths are enough to overcome its confused tone and an overly restrictive design that ensures you're never anywhere the designers don't want you to be. The best and most interesting part of Knack is the character's ability to grow as he accumulates additional relics. As Knack takes damage, he loses relics, which makes him smaller and more vulnerable. He can reclaim those relics, and increase in size, mostly by busting open crates scattered throughout the levels. The bigger Knack can not only take more damage, but also has stronger attacks and has a much longer reach.  Some of the more extreme changes in scale also give you a tremendous sense of perspective in power. Walking over, sometimes literally, the tiniest enemies as a giant version of Knack is one of it's finest moments.  That transition where you suddenly find yourself able to wade through any and all opposition is one of Knack's best and most reliable payoffs, but even that's sometimes spoiled by enemies that can kill you in one-shot and tedious end bosses. The standard for success shifts from doing things intelligently and creatively in the early parts, to doing things perfectly and predictably towards the end. I love the concept of managing your speed, size, and strength as actual resources and there's loads of potential for intriguing dilemmas where you need to risk those assets to acquire even more. Unfortunately, whether you're big or small in this game is more dependent on what the designer wants than on your own choices and actions. While small variations in size are generally tolerated, nearly every level decides just how big or small you're going to be. Whether you're trading in all your extra relics to open a door at the end of an early level, or opening up a giant box of relics just prior to a late-game boss fight, developer SCE Japan seems scared to let us be in control of too much.  This disappointment also applies to some of the alternate materials Knack can absorb. It's great to build a Knack out of mirrors, or ice, or flaming logs, but those elements are only ever available in specific situations where they're the only answer to the problem in front of you. As you play, you'll unlock special alternate versions of Knack, such as a vampire Knack who has to defeat enemies to offset a steady and persistent decline in relics. It technically adds a bit to the replayability to try levels as an alternate version of Knack, but not enough to keep bringing us back after that initial playthrough. Most of your time in Knack will be spent fighting and the range of enemies is generally satisfying, with each specific enemy type requiring a slightly different approach. Some jump and land with massive area attacks, others shoot waves of fast-moving projectiles, and still others are protected behind giant energy fields. The combination of enemies, particularly when one is a ranged fighter and the other likes to get close in, can also make for some tense tactical fights. Outside of a few special moves, there's really only one attack button, but it's varied based on how big you are, who you're fighting, and how close you are to them.  You can attack while jumping to create a sort of invincible TMNT-style attack that will keep you alive through many a trouble. Sony calls Knack a platformer, but there's really very little exploration or environmental challenges. Sure, there are some jumping sequences and traps, and the ever-present secret rooms, but the succession of fighting areas are small with one obvious entrance and one obvious exit, and it's just lather, rinse, repeat as you move from enemy to enemy. You'll occasionally be allowed to use other materials to build Knack – mirrors for instance can help get past security systems – but their use is always obvious and mandatory, so the player isn't really involved at all. What makes this particularly confusing is when the weak and puny humans take alternate routes to the end of the level without any clear story reason why you didn't just go along with them and avoid all the trouble in the meantime.  There are other choices that disengage the player. There are loads of short transition cutscenes where Knack jumps off a ledge, or climbs over a low wall, which is all stuff the player is usually doing anyway, so it's jarring to have the game wrest control away just to show you doing something you've already done a dozen times already. Worse are the cutscenes that show Knack doing something spectacularly cool, like destroying a munitions plant, that feel like they're cheating the player out of the payoff for an entire level. More Must-See PS4 Launch Content: Knack also struggles with some story issues, both with regard to the plot and the overall tone. There's only one character with any comprehensible goal or discernible backstory, and he's neither the hero nor the villain, which makes it hard to engage with the content. We might be willing to give games of this genre a pass on the thin narrative, but Knack continually seems to want to tell a story that just keeps falling apart. You start off fighting the goblins, who were kicked out of the cities by the humans, but it's never really established that the humans deserve to be spared from the goblins' revenge. You just beat the crap out of them because that's what the plot demands. Knack is full of these sorts of assumptions. I'm not quite sure what to make of Knack's tone, which is just as ambiguous as the story. The little version of Knack is undeniably adorable, in spite of his always-serious Ron Perlman voice, and the big 50-foot tall version is absolutely intimidating with a strong sense of power, even though it looks distractingly like a Muppet. While the character designs are intriguing, it's hard for me to look at Knack's face and not wonder at the lack of humor or charm in the rest of the game. The whole story reminds me of the relics that make up Knack himself – some basic, recognizable forms that really don't serve any function beyond giving Knack his shape. Playing Knack is like watching a dull movie on a plane – it's tolerable if all you want is a way to pass the time, but it's not something you'd seek out for its own sake. I finished in about 11 hours and, challenges, co-op, and secrets aside, there's just not much here worth recommending. Sure, some individual elements show potential, particularly when the scale of the encounters changes as Knack grows, but it never moves beyond playing it safe with the concepts or the characters.
Brian Albert	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/resogun-review	 Up, down, left, right. Before playing Resogun, those four words correspond to distinct directions. After a few rounds of Housemarque’s latest and most impressive twin-stick shoot ‘em up, those bearings blurred and gave way to one simple mantra: move or die. In its short but highly replayable campaign, Resogun creates an energetic, beautiful, and addictive loop of score chasing that’s tough to break free from. Many shooters are fought on a flat plane, but Resogun takes that plane and wraps space onto itself, creating a cylindrical battlefield. This choice sounds strange on paper, as it literally sends you around in circles, but the result is novel and refreshing gameplay. Enemies on the other side of the map can be seen before they’re encountered, letting you better judge the opposition and ration your limited weapons. Your standard laser rounds follow the curvature of the map, but only for a short distance. This allows for some tricky maneuvering, like trying to pick off enemies from outside of their most effective ranges. Mindless blasting is, thankfully, neither encouraged nor welcomed here. Believe it or not, this isn't a bad situation. It’s immediately noticeable that your ship can’t fire up or down – only horizontally. What initially seems like an arbitrary decision soon becomes a clear message: pay more attention to your positioning. Overcoming your limited attack angles means doubling down on movement skills, which prepares you for Resogun’s trickiest stages. It’s a teaching technique that feels more useful and more fun than any tutorial or loading screen hint. The arsenal is nothing out of the ordinary for a side-scrolling shooter. You can shoot, boost, launch bombs, and unleash a devastating overdrive beam that slows and decimates nearby enemies. The kicker is, aside from your standard lasers, everything is limited in some way. You start a level with only a few bombs, for example, and your powerful overdrive attack is charged only after collecting parts from defeated enemies. Resogun also rewards you with points for not activating any bombs during a round, so using one feels like both a victory and a loss. These restrictions lead to wonderfully tense moments where you’ll fight within an inch of your life before unleashing a super weapon because you don’t want to be penalized. The power Resogun offers is not without consequence, and I enjoyed that ever-present tension. Many of the stages look similar, but at least they all look great. When the screen is packed with enemies, glowing and twirling and spewing lasers and fireballs, it’s hard not to be impressed. The music, equally energetic and upbeat, is an excellent soundtrack for cosmic destruction. In a game like Resogun where gameplay is king, it’s imperative the frame rate never dips, and despite the veritable fireworks display, it stayed smooth.  Resogun promotes aggression through score multipliers that reset if you don’t score kills frequently enough, though not the reckless sort. You’ll have to play skillfully and without a moment of downtime. This need for speed couples well with Resogun’s boost feature, which lets you travel through enemies, and triggers an area-of-effect attack when you drop back to normal speed. Timing your boosts to escape danger or destroy a massive cluster of enemies requires foresight and restraint, and pulling it off always feels great. When a game’s goals directly inform its mechanics as Resogun’s do, that’s a sign of terrific game design. On top of that, at the beginning of each level you’re given one optional instruction: “Save the last humans.” Rescuing tiny people from their scattered cube prisons isn’t just a fun side distraction to keep you busy; it, like many other parts of Resogun, reinforces the idea that you need to keep moving at all times. It also earns you some extra points, lives, or bombs for your trouble. Ride the bomb wave for the best way to gather voxels. Though Resogun’s expectations for you are rigid, it offers a choice of three spacecraft with which to face its challenges. The selection is a standard but comprehensive lineup: one is fast and weak, one is slow and powerful, and one is balanced. Not having to unlock them was a smart move on the designers’ part. The five stages end in boss battles, but not all of them put up a real fight. For example, you must venture inside of one of the bosses, shooting it while avoiding moving beams and walls. Another fires lasers out of each hole you blast into it, making the fight more difficult as you progress. Others can be defeated simply by fleeing and firing behind you while occasionally boosting. After fighting to the bone to reach a supposedly difficult enemy, it’s a shame to sometimes be let off the hook so easily.  Speaking of high scores, if you don’t find them to be a sufficient carrot at the end of the stick, Resogun’s short play time may leave you wanting more. It takes around an hour to beat the missions on normal difficulty, but it should absolutely be replayed for high scores. Higher difficulties put a welcome pressure on, and had my palms sweating the sweat of a challenge well-met. Because missions are quick, and because there’s a nice variety of tough enemies and maneuvers available, Resogun encourages you to keep coming back to nab the high score and dethrone your friends. If you’re not the competitive type, the online-only co-op mode is a great way to enjoy Resogun with a friend. There are no specific two-player moves or other actual co-op mechanics, but it’s still fun coordinating to cover more ground and save humans on opposite sides of the arena. Bosses receive a noticeable vitality boost in this mode, so you don’t feel too overpowered as a duo. Unfortunately, there’s no way to earn more lives, so if you’re playing with someone who’s more skilled than you, prepare to spend a lot of time waiting for the next round. Or, you know, get better at Resogun. With some deceptively simple changes, Housemarque took a genre nearly as old as videogaming itself and made a tense, challenging, and excellent shooter. It may be short, but its addictive cycle of cylindrical shooter gameplay, great looks, and catchy music make it worth replaying in endless pursuit of that high score on the leaderboard.

Dan Stapleton	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/contrast-review	 I’ve got to hand it to Compulsion Games for setting Contrast in 1920s Paris. The City of Lights is an ideal location for a platformer that plays with shadows in such creative and interesting ways. Seeing this beautiful, stylized world from the perspective of a young girl’s imaginary friend gives it a wonderfully dreamlike quality. Contrast doesn’t always make the best use of its ideas to create consistently interesting puzzles, but when it does it’s a treat.  Amid the mixture of 3D and 2D platforming, Contrast is an emotional story of young Didi’s bumbling father attempting to find success and win back her showgirl mother. How? With risky deal with violent mobsters and a travelling illusionist. Naturally. The adults come off as a little hammy in a vaudevillian sort of way, but Didi’s performance is more human and relatable. There’s a somewhat bizarre turn at the last second that reduces the childlike wonder of it all, but getting to the end is no less charming. (That's not to suggest that the premise isn't suitably bizarre to begin with.) As Didi’s imaginary friend, you can only see the shadows and hear the voices of the real people she interacts with, and they become part of some unique level design. Having the power to slip between platforming in the 3D world to hopping from shadow to shadow in 2D at will opens up some very clever puzzling possibilities. For example, manipulating light sources to put shadows right where they need to be in order to reach a high platform is an idea with a ton of potential.   A few times, it's even realized. There are particularly affecting moments when you’re platforming over the shadows of Didi’s quarreling parents, and some fun scenes that take place in a broken-down amusement park. Control is often tricky, since a wrong step can abruptly knock you out of the 2D shadow plane. There’s no penalty for falling to your death, though, so experimentation is what it’s all about. It only ever hints at what complex shadow-jumping platforming between worlds could be, though. I felt like many of the techniques I learned in early puzzles were never really expanded upon. A standout of the excellent circus section has you playing the part of a princess who must continually save her incompetent rescuer in a shadow puppet play as Didi’s father narrates. It’s a clever concept that could’ve sustained its own Limbo-like 2D platformer, and it’s over too quickly.  Contrast’s shadowplay is enchanting, but the spell is broken midway through its roughly five hours, when the puzzles start relying on cliche ideas like moving boxes onto buttons to hold doors open. I mean, c’mon - at least put a heart on the box. Next to strikingly beautiful platforming magic like leaping from the shadows of a rotating carousel's horses, carting crates from point A to point B feels so pedestrian. Sadly, that's where I felt like I ended up spending the majority of my time. Picking up crates is also where Contrast is at its glitchiest, and I frequently got stuck in a mannequin pose when trying to pick up or interact with objects. At one point, a crate I’d dropped down a hole one too many times refused to respawn, and I had to restart a whole level. More Must-See PS4 Launch Content: It’s hard to say whether Contrast looks better while playing as one of those minimalist silhouettes or running around in full 3D space, but it never looks ordinary. On PC and PS4, the texture of the stone streets pops out in an eye-catching way as it glistens in the moonlight, and the lighting of the scenery is often impressive. The animation of the adults' shadows is expressive, but somewhat stiff, and their models are strangely proportioned (they all have huge hands). That's a minor detail, but much more severe are the surprising framerate dips on the PS4, particularly in the outdoor environments. It was especially apparent as I wandered around the streets of the semi-open areas wishing I had a map to direct me to my next objective. Contrast is attractive, but not so much that it should make a brand-new console work like this. Contrast is a game full of heart, beauty, and at least a few excellent puzzles. It’s at its best when it marries its poignant story to its platforming, and at its weakest when it’s about moving boxes, but it rarely goes very long without showing us something worth playing.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/flower-ps4-review	 If you’ve never had the pleasure of playing thatgamecompany’s Flower on PlayStation 3, you missed out on a creative, evocative experiment that’s unlike anything else. I fell in love with its calming music, stress-free exploration, and incredible aesthetic in 2009. Until I replayed it on PlayStation 4, it never really hit me that, you know, this could be better. On PlayStation 4, Flower is a stronger, even more beautiful game than the exceptional, unforgettable original. And better still, if you already own it on PS3, it’s yours for free on PS4.   Flower is a bit bewildering, conceptually, but its clean systems make it accessible and understandable despite the lack of explicit explanation. Levels begin with you controlling the force of the wind, guiding a single petal through fields of flowers. Breezing through grass and over hills brings dim, dark places to life, and each flower you touch blossoms, earning you another petal. By the end of a stage, your lonely starting petal is the centerpiece of a majestic floral trail, sailing through the sky of a gorgeous place you’ve helped create. Vibrance and change is an inspiring form of visual feedback -- colorful plant life represents progress, success, and the mark you’ve made in these incredible spaces. Every time I play through its 90 minute story, Flower leaves me with the same strong lasting impression I felt the first time. You are not just an explorer here: You are a creator. The uncomplicated input of its motion controls leads to a satisfying sense of minimum effort/maximum gain, allowing you to revive dead plants and open canyons by casually coasting through field and finding life to unlock at your own pace. The mechanics rarely change, but the simplicity of your interaction has a wide range of rewarding results. You achieve wondrous things, and it becomes clearer as you proceed that there’s a reason for it -- despite its minimalism, Flower has phenomenal ambition and a clear goal in mind. Throughout its relaxing, stress-free discovery, Flower subtly conveys a story of life, destruction, fear, and rebirth. It has something to say about nature, humanity’s destructive tendencies, and whether or not they can coexist. Games rarely feature thoughtful or relevant commentary. Flower has meaningful messaging, but it never preaches gospel or intrudes on the sublime meandering and resurrection. If metaphor or symbolism don’t do anything for you, Flower is just as enjoyable as a game where you explore a dying world, discover the tasks required to resurrect it, and move on having accomplished something beautiful.   The PS4 release is the best way to experience this, for sure. Flower’s visuals are noticeably improved by its 1080p resolution and 60 frames per-second performance. Everything runs smoother, and with added physics and particle effects, objects moves in a more convincing, natural way. Best of all, though, is the motion controls: Dual Shock 4 is a huge step ahead of its predecessor. With lighter gestures you can perform more precise movements, making it easier and more enjoyable to turn on a dime and collect more petals. After an hour or two, when it’s all over, there’s little room for Flower to do anything more with what it has. Within the framework of its goals, it is masterful, and it is masterful every time I play it again. Brevity enables focus, and its unexpected turns, surprising tonal themes, and climactic scenes all hit just as hard on my fifth replay as they did my first time through. More Must-See PS4 Launch Content: Whether you’ve never heard of Flower or you replay it regularly, the PlayStation 4 version is an excellent, unforgettable return to one of PlayStation’s finest games. It’s still profound, and now it looks and feels better than ever. For those who appreciate experimental artistry, Flower’s zen exploration is as good as it gets. Plus, it’s free if you already own it on another platform.
Michael Burns	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/17/steamworld-dig-a-fistful-of-dirt-review	" My solar-powered lamp is almost dead, but I press on into the depths of SteamWorld Dig: A Fistful of Dirt’s randomly generated mines. This is no place to be caught in the dark, but I'm close to a breakthrough – I can feel it. I chip through layer after layer of dirt, hoping that the little bit of steam left in my drill will let me find something worthwhile before something mean and hungry finds me. Risk-reward is the name of the game here, and it’s what drives this 2D platformer to greatness. Just as my lamp gives off its last light, I catch a twinkle in the darkness and smash my drill into the hard ground, grinding the gears until the earth cracks open beneath my feet. I tumble down safely and watch with lust as a fat, juicy diamond plummets into the darkness below. Even though death is costly, greed gets the better of me. I leap down after it. Riskier and riskier.  The rough landing nearly ends me, but I’m alive, and I have my prize. Now, as I try to think of a way back out, I hear a guttural moan in the cavern ahead of me. I pull out a rusty pickaxe, rushing headlong at the creature. Just when I think I'm going to make it, I hear the familiar hiss of a short fuse on the end of a long, red stick, and I remember the creatures can use explosives. Then everything goes white, and I'm back up on the surface with fewer dollars to my name than I began with. I'm crushed. But now I've got to get that diamond back. My ego is at stake. SteamWorld Dig has been a constant ride of ups and downs for me: moments of thrilling elation, where small risks lead to rich rewards... and moments where I lost almost everything. But its premise is so incredibly simple – dig through an abandoned mine for buried treasures to sell on the surface, buy upgrades, then repeat – that it refuses to let go, no matter how many times I've failed. Many times now I've picked it up with the intention of playing for just a few minutes before bed, only to find sunlight creeping across the face of my 3DS as the battery starts to give out. That hook has remained across every platform I’ve played it on since. The PlayStation 4 and PC versions, in addition to their crisper textures, improved animation, and newly added bloom lighting, sport a slightly wider field of view, making it easier to spot potential dangers in the mine below. The Vita port is more or less the same as the 3DS original, save for some minor interface adjustments and obvious increase in resolution. One unfortunate omission from the Cross-Buy enabled PSN release is Cross-Save functionality, but the PS4’s built-in remote play functionality makes up for this a little. An additional benefit of remote play: it brings the PS4’s wider field of view to the Vita’s small screen. Though the core action lasts only a few minutes at a time before our character, a cutely animated robot prospector named Rusty, has to retreat to the surface hub to recharge his solar-powered light source, it's easy to get lost in an endless cycle of ""just one more run."" Trading jewels and ore for cash to buy upgraded equipment, discovering new shortcuts through the mine, and inching your way closer to the bottom all comes together in a hypnotic sort of rhythm. It’s further enhanced by some exceptionally clever audio design, with the steady clinking of your pickaxe and the deep thrumming of the western-influenced musical score rendering the progression of outside time meaningless. The surface hub is a bit of a letdown, with characters that are fun to look at but ultimately forgettable, but perhaps this is for the best: they serve their purpose and little more, ensuring you're free to focus on the mine. While SteamWorld Dig's randomly generated, fully destructible environments and subterranean setting draw natural comparisons to Spelunky and Terraria, it plays more like a cross between Dig Dug and Super Metroid. You’ll carve your own path through the mine, though at certain predetermined points you'll discover special gear that allows you to overcome obstacles with an expansive, Samus Aran-esque skillset. For instance: you might chase some particularly valuable ore to the bottom of an unusually deep chasm with no apparent way to get back up, but if you survive long enough, you'll discover something like the double-jump boots, enabling your escape. It's a neat inversion of Metroid's most-imitated mechanic; where most games present you with new ways to move forward, SteamWorld Dig's upgrades often serve to get you safely back where you started... which, as you'll discover, is ultimately the only way to get to the end.  What I find most appealing about SteamWorld Dig is that many of Rusty's additional abilities can actually be skipped if you choose to dig a more conservative path to the bottom of the mine. This provides an interesting challenge for speed-runners. Since each new playthrough generates a different dungeon layout, you'll have to figure out the most efficient upgrade path (and stay alive) rather than simply memorizing item locations and map layouts. I wrapped up my first playthrough in just under six hours, but I'd died so many times that I couldn't afford the final upgrade because I had no money left to spend and my mine was tapped dry of resources. My second run was down to four hours, but my third took considerably longer as I tried to destroy every possible rock and dirt clod while still leaving a path back to the surface. There are many ways to play, and you're free to approach it any way you like. SteamWorld Dig is easily the best eShop game of 2013, and just as good on PS4, Vita, and PC. With a core mechanic that's as simple to understand as it is fun to experiment with, an engrossing atmosphere, and exceptionally refined platforming action that lends itself to multiple play styles and playthroughs, this is an addictive cycle that makes the 3DS difficult to put down. This review was updated on 3/25/14 to reflect impressions of the PlayStation 4, PS Vita, and PC versions."
Leif Johnson	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review	" In the beginning there was Final Fantasy XIV, and it was not good. For most games, the story would’ve ended there. But Square Enix, perhaps feeling that its prized franchise's name was in danger of becoming too literal, undertook a mammoth effort to keep Final Fantasy’s legacy from being marred by such a disaster. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is the resulting do-over, and it’s a huge success on PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. Beautiful, fun, and only a bit uneven in the late game, this dramatic reinvention easily establishes itself as one of the most sincere and effective apologies in gaming history.  First there's the continent of Eorzea itself, a stunning world of forests, deserts, and coasts that often delivers wallpaper-worthy moments, such as a the sight of watching the sun rise over the waters of the resort of Costa Del Sol. It's filled with weather effects ranging from simple fog to torrential rainstorms and even humdrum overcast days. It's even easy to get around in, thanks for aetheryte crystals that serve as teleportation locations at every major town, although the zones remain large enough that the immersion of walking or riding isn't lost amid crowded portals. True to Final Fantasy tradition, Masayoshi Soken's entirely new musical score is a constant pleasure, and it jumps smoothly from soothing tracks to heavy metal riffs on bosses like Titan. I also note that my character can sit down on most surfaces that looked as though they were made for sitting – a test I use to determine how much attention a world designer pays to detail. A Realm Reborn passes that test. It seems counter-intuitive to praise a game for reducing its graphical quality from a previous version, but in this case it was a good move. A Realm Reborn’s toned-down approach lets it run smoothly on mid-range PCs and PlayStation 3 and 4 while retaining much of the beauty. The detail even extends to the decent character generator, although as a proud owner of an epic beard, I was disappointed that my only beard options consisted of a scruffy, depressed-looking Hyur Highlander or the hulking Roegadyn. (Odd, too, since you see good beards on NPCs.) I went with the latter.   PlayStation 4 Version Updated March 14, 2014 The PlayStation 4 version of A Realm Reborn remains the same great experience that it is on the PS3, with enhanced graphics that come close to, but don’t quite match, those of its PC counterpart. With added features, such as the ability to easily use the surprisingly smooth Remote Play on a Vita, and the option to play using a keyboard and mouse by simply plugging them in, it’s obvious that Square Enix’s time was well spent on this version. And, as far as we’ve seen, there’ve been no hiccups at all hopping onto the servers day one. Note that owners of A Realm Reborn on PlayStation 3 owners can upgrade to the PlayStaion 4 version for free via the Mog station. (Upgrading will lock you out of the PS3 version.)    The main storyline is full of twists and struggles that give some meaning to the surrounding eye candy, even if at best it's little more than another tale of good struggling to overcome evil. Still, it packs some surprises. Around level 35 a shift occurs that jumpstarts the narrative into hyperdrive, and it never really loses momentum until it ends at level 50 (and rewards you with a sweet magitek mount). A Realm Reborn makes smart use of cinematics along the way, although Square Enix only took the time to add voices to a handful of them. Most of the time you have to read the story, but it’s well-written enough that it’s not just click-through material. Luckily, you can actually get in to enjoy these sequences these days – the server issues that plagued A Realm Reborn's first two weeks now seem to be a thing of the past. Much of the great strength of A Realm Reborn's class system lies in its versatility: simply switch out your weapon, and you'll become whatever class is associated with that weapon. That was true of the 1.0 as well, but the transition here is smoother thanks to a tab for multiple gear sets that lets you swap between classes in seconds. All classes also advance into specialized classes called jobs, which requires leveling a dominant class to 30 and a secondary class to 15. (To achieve my endgame ""Bard"" job, for instance, my character needed to reach level 30 as an Archer and level 15 as a Pugilist. It had the unintended effect of making me wish I'd leveled a Pugilist instead.) Not only does this design add the huge replay value of letting you level every class with the same character, but because you can borrow a handful of abilities from your secondary classes, it allows for some unique character builds that arguably outclass traditional talent-based systems.  Likewise, you can become a crafting or gathering class simply by equipping the appropriate tool, and they level just like a combat class. It's a great idea, and that's why it's such a shame that the actual products of crafting don't outperform the gear from late-game dungeons. They're still useful and necessary for enchantments and potions once you hit the raiding scene, but at this moment the endgame payoff doesn't always match up to the effort needed to level a crafter. Even so, crafting is actually fun in A Realm Reborn, and the design is such that you could play as nothing other than a crafter if you wished. There are even some entertaining, cinematic-powered storylines that accompany each tradeskill every five levels, which means that professions such as fishing and botany possess a bit of the excitement you find while leveling a combat class. Combat itself is drenched in MMO tradition, with some flashy animations that almost manage to mask the fact that it relies on the same system of tab-targeting and hotkeys that have defined the genre ever since EverQuest. Global cooldowns are here in abundance, and veterans from other MMORPGs that feature talent specs may shy away from realizing that most classes and jobs remain firmly rooted in a single role. A White Mage, for example, will always be a healer.  One of the best little touches of combat is that you can call your chocobo into battle with you, where it functions as a tank, healer, or damage dealer depending on how you spend your points. It's especially useful for solo combat, although its effectiveness is hampered by the way it also functions as a party member. In other words, tough luck if you want to use it while waiting out a dungeon queue, because summoning it will cancel the Duty Finder. There are also some small hassles associated with handling a chocobo. To use it effectively as a tank, I had to teach myself to start off with a light attack and let it get aggro since there's no direct way to control it. I also grew annoyed with the extra step needed to mount up again. First I'd have to dismiss the mount as a combat companion and then resummon it as a mount. Simply letting the mount hotkey trigger a desummoning of the combat counterpart would go a long way. Initially, the reliance on traditional MMO combat seems like a disappointment, especially considering the advances in action combat made by games like TERA, but A Realm Reborn makes up for it by demanding heavy group coordination and lots of movement in dungeons. Indeed, one of the best things about A Realm Reborn is the way it eases you into these later challenges. The early dungeons start out easy enough, but by the mid-30s levels you'll start seeing dungeons and boss-focused trials that demand full awareness of debuffs and your surroundings. Early dungeons like the Copperbell Mines and Sastasha seem almost too simple, for instance, but by the time you reach level 35's Sunken Temple of Qarn, you'll find yourself having to keep track of multiple threats at once – so much so that one random party I joined couldn't progress beyond the first boss. Still, I loved encountering that degree of challenge.  But that's where some of Final Fantasy XIV's commitments to modernity start to worry me. Early on, I marveled at how willing everyone was to explain the increasingly difficult boss fights for new players, but I noticed that the friendly atmosphere waned a tad as a neared the level cap. By the mid-40s, experienced players were expressing annoyance at dungeon rookies who wanted to watch the accompanying cinematics for their class stories, even to the point of asking for a vote-kick feature so they wouldn't have to wait. And as such, I'm against implementing one. This shift in attitude, I fear, has more than a little to do with the ""Duty Finder,"" which functions similarly to the Dungeon Finder in World of Warcraft that matches you with other players. The blessed convenience of such a feature is usually marred by the comparative anonymity (in that you may never see these players again) the feature allows, which many players seem to use as an excuse to bring the hostile socialization familiar to games like League of Legends to a fantasy MMORPG. It's more of a failing of the community than of the design – and fortunately, one that's not widespread at the moment – but I'm concerned that I've already seen the seeds of the pettiness that so plagues World of Warcraft's own Dungeon Finder.  Fortunately, there's plenty to do in Eorzea itself, particularly in the early levels. Aside from the main storyline, A Realm Reborn also delivers a wealth of sidequests that ensure that you usually have another means of gaining XP. On the one hand, there's guildhests that serve as group-based tutorials; elsewhere, you'll find guildleves that function as daily quests of sorts, and even a hunting log where you earn seals for gear from each of the Grand Companies that players can represent. True, many follow the familiar ""kill X of Y"" and ""FedEx"" templates, but Square wisely kept the required body counts involved to a minimum. And then we have FATEs, which are dynamic events similar to those found in Guild Wars 2 and Warhammer Online before it, and they do much to imbue Eorzea with a vibrancy that resembles a living world. In the early levels, they serve as a welcome alternative to the normal quests you stumble across in the world, and a level-matching requirement wisely keeps high-level players from griefing the events. They’re a bit too good for leveling, though, and by the late 30s, their effectiveness far outstrips any other means of gaining XP. As a consequence, it's common to see high-level players ignoring quests and dungeons completely and hanging around the aetheryte crystals that generate rested XP while waiting on the next FATE to spawn.  It's so severe that I stated in my review-in-progress that I had little trouble finding dungeon groups; by the time I reached the high levels, my waits had soared to around an hour and a half. Sometimes even beyond that. The reasoning seemed clear, just from looking around me: everyone else was too busy grinding FATES to worry about queueing for dungeons when they were so close to the level cap of 50. Until Square Enix reduces their effectiveness or increases the rewards for running dungeons, the latter might get a little lonely in the late game. There's another downside to them: by the time you're leveling your second class, most of the side quests are gone, leaving FATE grinding as the only efficient means of leveling. As for the end game? So far, its ambitious mix of hard-mode dungeons and raids looks to justify its subscription plan, and the challenges I've seen in the existing dungeons seem potent enough to bring me back for future content. At the risk of hyperbole, during my time with Final Fantasy XIV I've felt the most involved in an MMORPG ever since the classic release of World of Warcraft, and I'm eager to see what Square Enix accomplishes with it over the coming months and years. Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn is a great MMORPG experience on PC, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation 4. Grounded in tradition and learning from the lessons of the games that preceded it, it thrives on the strength of its excitingly varied and flexible class system and highly mobile combat. The challenge ahead for Square is to achieve the delicate balance of questing, dungeons, and FATEs for the second half of the leveling process as well as it has the first, because right now the late game bogs down in mindless grinds more than I’d like. But considering the stunning reversal of fortune that Square has achieved here, it seems like anything is possible."
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/04/outlast-review	" I can safely say that Outlast made me jump out of my chair more often in its four-hour descent into Hell than any other game ever has. It's a tense, brutal trek that strips you of any power to defend yourself as you try to avoid the deranged mental patients that roam the halls of this horrifyingly gorgeous world.You'll run, hide, and just generally be terrified as you discover the horrors that reside within Mount Massive Asylum. But in between the wealth of scares and beautiful environments, Outlast has a tendency to bog down via uninspired mission objectives and a few disappointing design choices. From the get-go, Outlast is one of the best-looking and sounding survival horror games to date. Everything from the dynamic lighting to a fantastic soundscape work together to keep you on edge every second of the experience. On both PC and PS4, I dreaded entering any new areas or opening any closed doors for fear of what lurked in the dark unknown. Little details that are often forgotten in games, like leaving a trail of bloody footprints after stepping through a pool of blood, really help sell the illusion that Mount Massive is an actual place.  But for as great as the world looks, the character models are represented with a bit less fidelity. They're not bad per se, but certain enemies that appear terrifying from a distance lose quite a bit of their terror when viewed up-close. You'll also notice quite a bit of enemy repetition during the latter half of the campaign. That being said, you'll probably be too busy running away like a maniac to notice most of the time. You're ostensibly powerless in Outlast, meaning that your main tools for survival are running and hiding. Barreling down a hallway with a beast right on your heels, bursting through a series of doors when you have no idea what's on the other side, and eventually finding a closet to hide in and evade your pursuer provides a fantastic and terrifying thrill. And once enemies begin tearing apart rooms and opening closets in search of you – yep, you can imagine just how nerve-wracking this game gets. Your guardian angel in Outlast comes in the form of a camera with a night-vision setting. Much of the asylum is bathed in darkness, so you'll be viewing a lot of the world through a bright-green lens. This helps create a great sense of tension, which is heightened by the fact that the camera runs on batteries that need to be found throughout the environment. Outlast forces you to be conservative with your resources, as running out of juice in a particularly dark area forced me to have to reload a prior save file and replay a good chunk of a level. This punishment seemed severe at the time, but ultimately acted as a lesson in how careful planning was essential in order to survive in this world. Where Outlast bogs down a bit is when it tries to shoehorn typical game design elements into the horror experience. Slowly making your way through a dank basement crawling with enemies is great – but having to activate three generators in order to restore power to the area? Not so much. While I'm not against the ""find three things"" structure of many games, its place in Outlast had a tendency to momentarily pull me out of the experience and squash tension.  Also, the fact that your character has no way of defending himself means that if you're discovered and cornered by one of your pursuers, you're probably going to have to restart that section. I found myself dying in specific encounters multiple times until I memorized the level layout and enemy patterns. That's not terribly out of the ordinary for a stealth game, but Outlast's strength is in its well-paced horror, and repetition dulls that power. Instead of being terrified, I was simply annoyed that I had to keep dying in order to figure out how to solve certain environmental puzzles. Thankfully these moments were far outnumbered by long stretches of tense, satisfying exploration which rewards you with a well-written and unsettling story. Diligent searching reveals numerous notes and diaries that help flesh out tragic tales of mental patients tortured by villainous scientists, and that provides a surprising bit of heart to this bloody tale. It's also one of those horror games that works both when you're playing it alone in the dark, as well as having a group of people gather around the television and experience the scares together. Outlast can stand proudly as a unique and terrifying survival horror game. Unlike many modern horror games, it remembers that the most frightening monsters are those that you can't kill, but have to flee from, and it creates an outstandingly creepy atmosphere that rendered me defenseless against its many well-paced jump scares. Annoying design choices and forced moments of repetition have a bad habit of spoiling the mood, but between them is an experience that's scary as all hell."
Cam Shea	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/25/rogue-legacy-review	 I ran forward through the castle complex, but no matter how hard I squinted, the world outside the small bubble of clarity around me remained blurry and out of focus. “Damn this short-sightedness,” I muttered before hacking at a beast in my path. Nothing. The damn blade passed right through it. Oh great, I’m seeing things again. Dementia’s a bitch. Welcome to Rogue Legacy, a game quite unlike anything else I’ve come across. Looking for all the world like a 2D action-platformer, behind the charming pixel art presentation is a consistently surprising experience, packing a dizzying array of variables. It’s all anchored by robust Roguelike game design, which means a procedurally generated world and perma-death. Each time you enter the castle, its layout and the challenge ahead will be different, and if you die, well, that’s the end of that hero - it’s time to send one of his heirs in to try and finish the job. Thankfully, the meta-game lets you spend any gold earned during the last run on your family’s fort, which means unlocking new classes and perks, and upping your stats for the next attempt. The core sword and spell action-platforming is tightly designed. And boy, there’s going to be a lot of attempts. When you first start playing Rogue Legacy you might last a minute or two before succumbing to one of the ghouls, undead, or other nasties that lurk inside the castle complex. It’s a classic 30-second gameplay loop – hacking, slashing, running, jumping, dashing, evading, and spellcasting, repeated until you die. This core gameplay is compelling in and of itself - Rogue Legacy is wonderful to control provided you have a good gamepad - but to make true progress you’ll need to boost your stats, get better equipment and activate perks. Gradually your runs will get longer and longer. Then you’ll wander into a higher-level area and die almost instantly. The cycle of life, eh? It’s an excellent way to structure the challenge, and really puts the fear of god into you. You may be kicking ass in what amounts to Rogue Legacy’s foyer, but boy, you’re not ready for the forest yet, or – god forbid – the dank dungeons underneath the castle. This is a game where your best option is to turn and run away if you enter an area you’re not ready for. This is a game where it may be several hours before you beat the first boss – despite being able to reach it in a matter of minutes - and many more before you’re ready for the next. Good thing the bosses stay dead after you die, otherwise beating Rogue Legacy would be an even more distant prospect. The bosses can be next to impossible with the wrong character, but as you'd expect, learning their attack patterns is key. Now, levelling up is all well and good, but Rogue Legacy has one very unique trick up its sleeve in addition to this. I’ve already mentioned that you send an heir in to continue the fight after each death, but you actually get a choice of three, and each has a random class, random spell, and random traits. Traits? Yup, and they’re glorious, surprising and bewildering. Ever played as a hero suffering from vertigo and OCD? How about a colour blind protagonist who also has Alzheimer’s? ADHD and dementia anyone? Tunnel vision and irritable bowel syndrome? The list goes on and on. The really clever part of this system is that many of these traits have significant gameplay ramifications: ADHD means you move faster, far-sightedness and near-sightedness leave areas of the screen blurry, and characters with dementia will hear things and see enemies that aren’t there. Dwarves, meanwhile, are so light and small they don’t activate spiked floor panels and can access areas no other characters can. Of course, some traits really have been included just for fun. Dyslexia, for instance, means any in-game text is garbled, while a character with coprolalia (Tourette’s syndrome) will swear any time he or she gets hit. Heroes with hypochondria, on the other hand, will have much larger numbers pop up any time they take damage, while you’ll probably avoid vertigo at all costs – unless you’re a masochist – because who wants their world to be upside down? Getting your head around the traits system is all about working out what comes with meaningful changes to the world and how that factors into your play style. The world near long-sighted heroes is out of focus. Cool, right? And that’s really just a taste – there’s plenty more for you to discover when you play it yourself... which you absolutely should. The traits are just one facet, too. Once you factor in the ten classes and all the spells characters can have, the list of potential combinations is incredibly long. It really is pot luck, and no matter how far through the meta-game you are, you will never know exactly what to expect. Of course, the further in you are, the more you’ve honed your skills and come to know how best to use each class, trait, and spell, and – crucially – how to select the random character that you can best utilise. The learning curve is right on the money, and almost every run has something to teach you, whether it’s an epic boss-killing mission with a heaven-sent character that’s able to survive a wide-roaming journey through the castle, or an abject, miserable failure with the best of a bad bunch. Mind you, the random nature of Rogue Legacy won’t be to everyone’s tastes - getting a series of dud characters can definitely feel punitive at times, as opposed to a learning experience. Every class differs in core stats and special ability, while equipment and enchantments are class agnostic. Thankfully, the mix of enemies is quite compelling. Each area introduces new enemies - ninjas in Hannya masks, headless horses that charge the player - as well as fresh variants on old designs. Juggling a set of monsters with their own disparate attack patterns is a big part of the challenge. The five bosses represent a good mix of bullet hell and precision platforming too, whether you’re facing a huge flaming skull or a gigantic gelatinous blob. The castle holds more surprises than just rooms full of enemies. Special rooms abound, including carnival games, shrines, mini-boss battles, and plenty more. Perhaps the most interesting, however, are the fairy chest rooms. Each has a very specific challenge for you to beat. Kill everything! Get to the chest without jumping! Don’t fight! Don’t take damage! You get the idea. Unlocking a fairy chest will net you a rune that can be equipped for specific perks, like air-jumping, dashes, limited flight, extra gold, reflecting damage taken back onto enemies, gaining health/mana from kills, and so on. Best of all, these runes stack. So if you want to, you can spec your character with highly customised ability sets. Multiple air-jumps? Don’t mind if I do!   The review commentary for the PC version. While some of the fairy chest rooms can be conquered by almost any character, others require particular traits or sets of runes. Thankfully, you can use the Architect - one of three characters unlocked via your fort (alongside the Smithy and Enchantress) - to lock down the layout of the castle for successive attempts. He’s a great inclusion, and indicative of Rogue Legacy’s ability to balance random elements with tight, fair game design. In fact, if that balance was wrong, this game wouldn’t be anywhere near as compelling. It’s a testament to Cellar Door Games that the team was able to juggle so many elements and make it work. It’s one hell of a meaty undertaking too. The most adept players will be able to beat it in about 15 hours, whereas I sunk in considerably more time than that. It’s a lot of gaming for only $15 (USD $17 on PlayStation), and once you’ve finished your first play-through, New Game + awaits, which lets you keep all your stats, weapons and runes, but gives you a much harder variant of the castle to beat.   PS3/PS4/Vita Versions – July 28, 2014 Rogue Legacy’s console/handheld debut is the best version of the game to date. It incorporates all the changes that have been made to the PC original over the last year; most notably the boss remixes (unlocked as each is defeated), four new traits, a new secret class, 28 new rooms and a number of balance tweaks to smooth out the difficulty. The PlayStation build also introduces two exclusive new traits and additional balancing – such as 30% buff to gold find for characters with vertigo. And let’s not forget trophy support. Anyone who can get the Thanatophobia trophy – for beating the game without dying more than 15 times – has my eternal admiration/pity. It all adds up to a game that hasn’t been fundamentally changed, but has been intelligently refined and expanded upon. Rogue Legacy had a great rhythm and tight controls to begin with, and those elements now shine more brightly than ever, and are integrated into a game with greater variety and a better paced challenge.  All three PlayStation versions run at 60fps and look superb too, while cross-buy and cross-save means you can switch between handheld and home theatre with ease… and for the one very reasonable price. If you’re into Roguelikes, action-platformers, the indie scene or games with a pixel aesthetic, you owe it to yourself to give Rogue Legacy a shot. Rogue Legacy is one of my favourite games of 2013 so far. It’s a hugely compelling mix of 2D action-platforming and Roguelike game design, with excellent pixel art and just the right level of challenge. It’s the wildly inventive traits system, however – and the fact that it’s meaningful – that really elevates Rogue Legacy. This is a game with a genuinely unique hook, and the gameplay stones to back it up. Clever, creative, and addictive as hell.
Marty Sliva	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/31/the-swapper-review	 My heart aches for so many different reasons every time I solve a puzzle in The Swapper. The first time I softened what would've been a fatal fall by creating a copy of myself at the last minute and swapping my consciousness into it was absolutely revelatory. Watching the body that I’d inhabited just moments before crumble onto a lifeless heap as it hit the ground gave me pause in a way that few games ever do. Were these copies simply lifeless tools with the sole purpose of helping me overcome a challenge? Or was I actively murdering countless versions of myself in cold blood? Or is it suicide? That’s the big question that arose as I spent about four hours (excluding the time I got stuck) solving a series of puzzles and piecing together the profound and well-told story of a derelict space station. Though The Swapper’s cloning mechanic brings to mind games like Braid and Closure, it differentiates itself by giving you your one and only puzzle-solving tool right at the start. The titular gun that allows you to create copies of yourself and swap places with them is relatively simplistic in its singular function, but developer Facepalm Games' uncanny ability to continually put us in foreign predicaments vaults The Swapper into the ranks of the elite puzzlers. While the challenges themselves start out simple enough -- spawn a clone in an inaccessible place and swap into it -- they eventually evolve into machinations of sheer wonder. Learning how to utilize gravity, timing, inertia, and ultimately merciless clone murder for your own personal gain becomes paramount in completing its suite of clever challenges. Though I was mostly mesmerized by the thought and foresight required to overcome the puzzles, I hit a wall right at the end. I confess, with only two puzzles left between me and the finale, I simply could not wrap my head around the solutions. I spent a few hours chipping away at them with no avail. Eventually I resorted to outside help, but as is the mark of a truly fantastic puzzle game, the solutions caused me to slap my forehead (perhaps where the developer Facepalm got its name?) and ask why I hadn’t thought of that. These puzzles are as well designed as the rest, and had I taken a day off and come back to them with a fresh set of eyes, I'm sure the solutions would've come to me. The Swapper is rich with this kind of impeccably designed challenge, and the act of finally discovering a solution to one brings the same bittersweet realization that I'll never be able to experience the joy of solving that puzzle with a fresh mind again I got from Portal. These fantastic obstacles exist within a stunning 2D world that rewards patient and observant players with one of the most emotional and thought-provoking stories I've experienced in quite some time. Making it seem effortless, The Swapper's atmosphere tells the story of a crumbled civilization aboard an abandoned space station primarily through subtle cues spread across locations ranging from the foliage of a botany dome to the sofas of an abandoned rec room. Only a few bits of well-written prose are spread around. As the story unravels, fans of some particularly heady science fiction will be able to spot The Swapper's influences. Without giving too much away, it's clear that the folks at Facepalm are big fans of classic films like 2001, Moon, and Solaris. It's the rare game that dares to ask some tough questions, and is then fearless enough leave to the player alone to come up with their own answers.  Through exploration, a beautifully crafted melancholy tone reveals itself with the same sad grace that exists throughout Super Metroid, and that this mood is strengthened by the striking and unusual art style. Created from photographed clay models, each piece of the environment has a satisfyingly tangible quality to it, and taking a moment to soak in your surroundings is akin to marveling over an expertly crafted diorama. Never before has a game forced me to question my every single move. Each time I created a copy of myself in order to progress through the world, I cringed at my actions in the best possible way.   PlayStation 4 Version Quick note: the PS4, PS3, and Vita versions of The Swapper are cross-buy as well as cross-save. The PS4 version of The Swapper is every bit as gorgeous, smart, and emotional as its PC predecessor. However, by big question going in to the console and handheld versions was whether or not the transition from mouse to analogue stick would negatively impact the experience. After all, many of The Swapper's puzzles demand quick reactions and pin-point aiming accuracy. Thankfully, the Sony versions include the ability to rise and lower sensitivity to help find your sweet spot, and the presence of a reticle on screen helps make movement and puzzle-solving every bit as enjoyable.   PlayStation 3 Version Couldn't really spot any differences between the PS3 and the PS4 version. It looks and controls the same as its big brother.   PlayStation Vita Version Being able to play through The Swapper on the go is fantastic, but I do have one minor gripe. A few of the rooms zoom the camera out and leave your character as a relatively small blip on screen. This isn't a problem on a television or monitor, but I found myself losing my character a few times on the Vita in these larger chambers. Definitely not a huge problem, but something to keep in mind. The Swapper tempted me with ingenious puzzles, transported me to a fully realized science-fiction world, and made me ask questions about mortality and morality that few video games have ever dared to explore. Very few puzzle games have ever managed to marry impeccable challenges with a mature storytelling quite like this – there's no fluff or extraneous content here, only a prime example of how to create a tight, unforgettable gaming experience.
Mitch Dyer	http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	" There's a mutual awe between people discussing the deep secrets and mystery of Fez. Curiosity, envy, and excitement dominate conversations about bewildering thematic patterns, creative solutions to intelligent puzzles, and unforgettable level design. Players are likely to gush about the beautiful aesthetic and childlike sense of wonder in equal measure. They'll probably say something about the insane but exciting ambitions, how bad their brains hurt, and how cute the little hat is, too. Fez appeals to the adventurous soul's want for discovery, and delivers it in an entertaining and original way. After a catastrophic event adds a third dimension to a 2D world, Gomez, the fez-adorned hero, finds himself capable of shifting the dimensional plane. This is where Fez starts challenging player perception. Imagine the world like a four-sided column. With each pull of a trigger or press of A/D keys, Gomez rotates the column left or right 90 degrees. Each rotation displays a different side of the landscape, each of which has a distinct set of objects to interact with. This simple device changes where Gomez can go and how he can get there. If there's no means by which to climb higher, rotating the scene may reveal a hidden ladder or new ledge. Fez further complicates matters when it lets illusion become reality. Manipulating pieces in such a way that they look traversable is all Gomez needs to navigate. In twisting the world to your will, disconnected objects become the literal stepping stones to your success. Perhaps a single platform becomes part of a wall, or positions itself within jumping distance of another platform. If two separate, smaller ladders appear as one long ladder from a certain angle, they act accordingly. Fez makes no apologies for its complexities. Rather than relying on instruction, players discover possibilities by experimenting at their own pace. There's no threat, no urgency, and no consequence for death. Everything exists as is. It's just waiting for you to find it. The rotation gimmick could have made a simple side-scroller something far more frustrating, but the dozens of levels are all laid out quite cleverly. New areas are always within reach, and altering the camera gives Gomez plenty of extra opportunities to explore. You can always get to the next area, even if you don't quite know what to do when you arrive. One quarter of the opening area. Fez has so much to see and do that most players will make their way through numerous stages in a short span of time. They'll probably do so without realizing the number of treasure chests, alternative routes, or additional puzzles they've missed in each map. As they discover the rules and how best to get around, they'll return to earlier areas to dig deep into the remaining mysteries. Really, though, experiencing its aesthetic is Fez's true reward. The terrific detail of its pixel-painted universe, old-school-inspired music, vibrant art, and ever-changing scenery bring the brilliant world to life. There's such an absorbing diversity in the way levels look and sound that it's enough just to be part of it regardless of the character's goals. The whimsical tone to the writing in Fez also contributes to the overall idea that it just wants you to enjoy yourself. Early on, before Gomez gains access to the third dimension, everyone is ingrained in their 2D ways. Characters comment on how flat you're looking today and the nonexistence of other dimensions. They're so disbelieving of 3D that it's all they talk about. When a cube appears in the sky and blows up, everyone becomes frightened of 3D. Then it's up to Gomez to pick up its actual, exploded pieces. Owls, man. Owls. Fez also sneaks in some satirical material just for kicks. Dot, your helpful floating companion, doesn't know anything about anything. In any other game Dot would be your guiding force, a talking tutorial. It forgets what certain objects are for, if it even has anything to say other than ""Uh, I don't know what this is."" Fez also goes out of its way to make the gaming-literate members of the audience smile. Tetris pieces have a prominent thematic presence in the quiet story. Most of the audio effects sound just like old NES games. Dot even busts out a ""Hey, listen!"" The most astonishing thing about Fez is how it, like the games it uses as inspiration, imposes itself on the real-world. The mechanical gimmick in Fez makes players consider and take advantage of perception. This thought often applies outside the game, too. Conditions to fully complete Fez include analyzing the Achievements list for a subtly placed password. Punching in the code unlocks a bonus collectible cube piece. It's the modern equivalent of the long-forgotten cheat code, or the codec frequency hidden on the back of Metal Gear Solid's case. Fez also forces itself on reality by tucking QR codes in secret spots. Scanning them gives players additional unlock codes. This means players need to find their smartphones, potentially download a QR-scanner application, or borrow someone else's device. One way or another, players need to stop playing and go out of their way to use a physical thing to interact with Fez. Without spoiling everything, it also tricks players on multiple occasions into thinking something is wrong with their computer. During my playthrough, I even wrote down locations of locked doors for later, and sketched abstract drawings as I tried to learn a made-up language. I haven't done anything like this in 15 years. This all makes sense, I swear. Fez pervades the player's life so completely it's almost corporeal. It's a forward-thinking game looking back, and that philosophy coalesces to make members of Fez-centric conversations sound like raving lunatics. When talks about manipulating dimensions, discovering fragmented cubes, talking to owls, finding treasure maps, and reading a funky moon language fire up, bystanders won't know what's going on. But they'll want to know, they'll want to learn, and they'll want to be part of it. Unlike the Xbox 360 and PC versions, Fez does not suffer any noticeable decrease in frame rate, ever, on PS4, PS3, or PS Vita. I did have one bug while playing Vita that caused the camera to focus on something other than Gomez, but a quick reboot of the game fixed everything. The fact that Fez is cross-buy on PlayStation works enormously in its favor, too -- and having a save file transfer from PS3 to Vita to PS4 is fantastic. The future is rad, and as Fez is so fond of reminding us, so is the past.  The sum of Fez’s intelligent level designs, perception mechanic, massive number of stages and secrets, and incredible art is so much more than just a shout-out to old-school gaming. Fez is a game in love with games. It has a respect for classic ideals and a confidence in its original ideas. Polytron draws on this to remind players why they fell in love with video games in the first place, all the while daring to make them think about the medium from a new perspective."
Colin Moriarty	http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	" Sound Shapes ambiguously floated in the PlayStation ether for a while. Originally created as a Vita exclusive, it was some time ago that we first declared it to have serious potential as a launch title. But Sound Shapes slipped from the launch window, and anxious players had to patiently wait so developer Queasy Games could port it to PlayStation 3. Now, Sound Shapes has arrived on PS3, PS4, and Vita alike, and I’m happy to report that it's a stellar experience no matter where you play it. Sound Shapes packs beautiful visuals, a stunning audio array, rock-solid gameplay and a suite of creation and sharing tools that unify all versions of the game. That last part’s good news, as Sound Shapes’ low price buys you both the PS3, PS4, and Vita iterations of the game.  Instantly striking about Sound Shapes is its presentational fluidity, its ability to get you right into the action through its gorgeous, minimalist, no frills approach. This immediately shines through from its compulsory tutorials. Though Sound Shapes contains a slew of options, it behooves you to get right into its 20-stage campaign first, since doing so unlocks scores of components that can be used in creating your own stages later on. And beating Sound Shapes’ campaign unlocks two other modes that will be interesting to challenge-seekers and Trophy-hunters in particular. Those modes fully compound Sound Shapes’ inherent fun factor. The campaign itself is novel right off the bat because each of the five “worlds” (called “albums” and filled with stages in-game) are designed by different visual artists. Better yet, a different musician was assigned to each album, giving the varied art its own distinct and unique audio accompaniment. For instance, the four stages of CORPOREAL (designed by Superbrothers with music from Jim Guthrie) feel, look and sound different than the three stages in the Cities album (designed by Pyramid Attack with music from Beck). PixelJam, Colin Mancer and Vic Nguyen are some of the other artists in the game, with more music from the likes of I Am Robot, Proud and deadmau5. Gameplay is fairly straight forward – Sound Shapes is very much a side-scrolling platformer – but there are a number of twists that will keep you on your toes. Each stage comes littered with collectible circles that, when gathered, add components to the background music. As you begin to collect more and more, the music grows in robustness, losing old features – such as a gentle hi-hat hit or a jarring bass strum – and gathering new notes, instruments and chords in their wake. The motivation of the game’s little blob character remains unknown – he simply wants to get to the end of any stage where a record player can be found, allowing him to move on – but that’s one of the strangely endearing features of Sound Shapes. It’s open to interpretation. As a result, Sound Shapes has multiple layers as both a standalone platformer and as something more, something deeper and more artistic. It isn’t designed to be ruthless. It’s actually quite forgiving, casual and easy to understand; that’s part of its charm. You can easily beat the game in under three hours, but when you compete with the masses on worldwide leaderboards that chronicle both your aptitude for collecting a level's ""sounds"" and the timeliness (or lack thereof) in which you beat a stage, Sound Shapes’ brief campaign quickly balloons by becoming the worthwhile sum of its many parts. But only when you beat Sound Shapes does the game truly begin in earnest. Thrashing through the campaign unlocks two new modes – Death Mode and Beat School – that open up the essence of Sound Shapes for players to dissect at a molecular level. While Beat School challenges musically inclined gamers to put together beats using only Sound Shapes’ creation tools and their ears, Death Mode puts players back into sticky situations, tasking them with collecting a certain amount of objects in a given time. As a musician, I blazed through Beat School, but I can’t help but wonder how the everyday gamer will do with them. Death Mode, on the other hand, was far more challenging for me.  Through these two modes, all but one of Sound Shapes’ Trophies are earned, and like the PSN exclusive Dyad, this makes Trophy-hunting an entirely separate and novel affair from playing the game itself. While earning the game’s only Gold Trophy comes by way of beating the campaign, its other 32 core Trophies – all Silver – will come via arduous Death Mode adventurism and a knack for recreating music in Beat School. And yes, Sound Shapes doesn’t only come packing a Platinum Trophy, it also comes packing three separate Trophy lists for the three versions of the game. And if you sync your save from one device to the next, expect to earn all of the Trophies from your Vita on your PS3, PS4, and Vita. Speaking of syncing saves, Sound Shapes allows players to send their progress from one iteration of the game to the other. And while I preferred playing Sound Shapes on Vita, the PS3 and PS4 versions are equally splendid in both core gameplay and content creation. Likewise, created stages cobbled together with the game’s intuitive creation tools can also be shared and played across platforms, and part of Sound Shapes’ lasting appeal will no doubt be derived from the player-created stages that will undoubtedly get more complex and impressive as time goes on. With that said, I encountered issues with both syncing my saves between games and playing user-generated content. It took me around 10 tries to get my PS3 to read my synced Vita save in particular – a problem a producer on the game told me was due to being signed into the PSN before booting the game up – but regardless, the issue exists. Likewise, I tried to play a handful of user-generated levels and would get error messages just as many times as I would be able to successfully jump in and get playing. The reason for these issues remain to be seen, and again, a fix would be nice. Connection problems and online funkiness aside, Sound Shapes absolutely floored me. Just about everything it does – and with its grand aesthetic taken as a whole – will blow you away. Sound Shapes isn’t only a totally novel game that melds unlikely components together. It’s also successful at trying something new and different. It’s bold, daring and unlike anything you can play on PlayStation 3, PlayStation Vita, or PlayStation 4."
