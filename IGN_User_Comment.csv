http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	I bought Divinity: Original Sin for PS4. PoE actually interests me more, so I wish I had known that this was coming out when I did. Then again, D:IS has online co-op, so that is a big sell for me. Can't go wrong with either one, right?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	Bought this game on mac when it was first released but didnt get very far always been tempted to go back. Can anyone confirm if the story is great start > finish?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	shiiiiit i'm very tempted
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	This game is so addicting and is def a 9/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	Was really stoked to pick this up on PS4 until I heard about the long loading times... I mean... it's a 15GB game! What reason is there in 2017 for a game with these graphics to have a minute loading screen!?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	"They made the PS4 controls easier and better than keyboard and mouse ever was for this game.
Played the PC version extensively before getting the PS4 version yesterday. A few hours in on my current playthrough on PS4 and I can tell you they did a phenomenal job with the controls, the GUI, gameplay, graphics, man everything. I absolutely love how they made it so easy and intuitive to interact with your environment (looting, starting conversations, opening doors/chests) and how smooth and straightforward the other game mechanics are."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	I cringed the whole time, but if you like it that's cool too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	This looks awesome. Diablo 3 was damn good on consoles.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	"Yea but except for the top down view, it's really not like Diablo. It's more like the old Baldur's Gate games of the 90's. Lots of reading, walking around and long periods between combat.
img {-moz-force-broken-image-icon: 1;}"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	I imagine playing this on consoles would be a form of torture.  Great game but I'll stick with my mouse and keyboard.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	@Fennarth It seems like they figured out the most elegant possible solution for this problem.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	@Fennarth  M/KB is so overrated.  Nothing like sitting at a desk like your working- very uncomfortable.  Controllers were specifically designed for gaming, M/KB- negative.  The only reason I can see M/KB is competitive PC FPS games.  I can see this game being M/KB though- its whats the term- CRPG? makes sense.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	@Fennarth  So FPS and CRPG- correction.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	@JEF848484 @Fennarth  Also RTS's, TBS's, visual novels, MOBA's, regular RPG's, ARPG's (Diablo, Path of Exile, etc), and anything else which require's precision or lots of different commands.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	"@Obrusnine @JEF848484 @Fennarth True- But I can care less about most of those genres.  What do you mean by ""regular RPG's""?   I just cant fathom sitting up tight at a desk for hours and hours after doing it at work all day.  Pressing the wrong dam keys, etc...To each their own though."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	"@JEF848484 @Obrusnine @Fennarth  What does it matter if you don't care? That doesn't mean they don't exist. These genres are why the M+KB remains a very relevant control scheme, because some games are meant for a controller and some are meant for a keyboard. It would be lunacy to ever limit myself to using just one.

As for ""regular"" RPGs, I mean stuff that wouldn't be considered an Action-RPG (The Witcher 3). Stuff like Dragon Age, Mass Effect, or anything else with a deep ability pool. On console those games need to be constantly paused in order to select your abilities (especially the earlier games) while on PC you get a much more convenient hotbar."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	@Obrusnine @JEF848484 @Fennarth What you call convenient, I call uncomfortable and awkward- agree to disagree. game on.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	"@JEF848484 @Obrusnine @Fennarth  So, you find it more comfortable to have to constantly pause your experience in order to issue commands, than to have your commands instantly recognized? Controllers alone can extend the playtime of these games up to 10 hours or more. I'm not just saying it's more convenient, it is objectively more convenient and is also much of the time the way the game was meant to be played. 

Micromanagement on a controller is a pain in the ass. It doesn't mean it isn't possible, but to pretend like you're not getting an inferior experience is just moronic."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	@Obrusnine @JEF848484 @Fennarth I disagree as I have played Witcher 3, Dragon Age and Mass Effect on console and I was seldom inconvenienced by the controls.  I was only talking about Pillars of Eternity as a mouse cursor is clearly more convenient.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	I mostly game on consoles, owning both a PS4 and XB1, but a game of these mechanics was obviously intended to be played with a mouse and keyboard.  It just seems annoying trying to direct combat with a controller when precision is demanded.  I don't care much for RTS games either.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	@Fennarth O yea I agree, as these games were purely made for PC gaming.  FPS games makes sense too cause of the aiming.  Long RPGS with a lot of questing for hours and hours - controller all the way.  Its not that I oppose M/KB (though I can see how would think that, lol)- its the positioning, up tight at a computer desk- the identical position after sitting at work for hours- is so not relaxing.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review	Would love to play a demo of it on PS4 but there isn't one. Potential customer lost.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	 The game nobody wanted 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	"is this that game ive heard so much about?

is it,,









KNACK 2TWO BAAAYBEEE"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	Knack 2 is a nice improvement on the combat. Some simple puzzles, nice visuals and decent story make it a solid and relaxing platformer. Glad I picked it up :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	@Codecat3 best way to describe it.  A Solid Relaxing platformer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	 KNACK 2 THA FUTURE
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	@KNACK2  ooooo missed opportunity.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	"Lost Legacy is like 8hours of game play. Not much of replay value. No thanks. I'll watch it on youtube. Never even play the first Knack. Was hoping Knack 2 is good. Disappointed after the knack 2 demo at E3. Hopefully better exclusive for next release.
img {-moz-force-broken-image-icon: 1;}"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	@wallance13 Knack 2 is great mate well worth the money in my opinion 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	how...did....this...game...get...a...sequel????????
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	@soracantfail  They said that they just simply wanted to do one. Admire the passion, though it doesn't seem to come through in the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	@soracantfail  Hard work and determination created our god, but it wasn't enough for many. So he rose again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	@soracantfail I was wondering the same thing...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	 I had some fun with this game. It definitely looks like a God of War for kids but damn the personality of Knack is bland as hell. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	I didn't even know this game was being made 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	 Knack 2 = Goty
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/05/knack-2-review	Probably wasn't smart to release this game so close to the release of Destiny 2.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	I don't understand how a game thats supposed to be a MOBA is supposed to have any teamwork at the speed they play this game at. It just looks like nonsense on screen. Paladins is much better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	"Ok i admit it. We know that the title was ""Gigantic"" But this well. You know."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	Does anyone know when this is available on the Xbox store in Australia? Im assuming this is another game that is having issues with the rating system here.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	Played the alpha/beta 2 years ago I think and it was decent. Thought it was already released. I'm not sure if it's good enough to carve it's own niche though. If it came out 4-5 years ago, it could have became a bigger thing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	maybe they shouldn't release a game like this in an over saturated market it never works
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	 I remember playing this at Pax Prime a few years ago, wow it took a long time to finally come out. I'm not a big fan of MOBAs but I did enjoy this one back at Pax. Especially since it has shorter matches, I might try it out. I have no interest in dedicating an hour or 2 to only one match, I don't care what game it is, I'd rather spend that time progressing in a singleplayer game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	"I honestly thought this was out a long time ago.  I feel like it's been in ""early access"" mode for like....18 months or some really long period of time.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	This game is really very interesting, but it's hero pool and activity list are too short. If they will make some new modes and chars- it'll be awesome
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	@bioswat  They've released two characters in the month since the game came out (with another character coming within the next 2 weeks).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	@UsagiYoJimboFanClub @bioswat I know they're trying and I really liked this game, but still with +3 chars roster is limited. I'll play it for sure, but a bit later. Really good game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	This review is too short.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	@BloodborneLore I see what you did there :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/30/gigantic-review	 Only moba i screw with are Dota 2 and HotS and im casual with them. Don't have time for this atm. Seems ok though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	It was definitely a lot better than I was expecting. I'm not good at RTS, but this game enticed me to try again and again. I'm not a fan of the roomba character as he made movements disorienting- at least to me. And the hub of the game is a bit confusing and kinda boring to traverse. The graphics are nice, the music is amazing. The rabbids are actually funny(for once). This game oozes charm and I wld have rated it a whole point higher.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	Too low. After some time with the game I would give it an 8.8.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	 Damn this game gets hard. Im JUST at the smasher level and I get murdered. GREAT game though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	I have to say that I am very glad I don't listen to most reviews when it comes to my purchases! I haven't had this much fun with Mario since Sunshine. However, Mario isn't the star of this show. The Rabbids are the greatest thing to hit a Mario game since Yoshi! I know that sounds hard to believe but let me explain. I laughed almost at every turn and video games hardly ever make me laugh! It is well written and keeps each world fresh with new ideas! Not that my opinion counts but this is the best game of the year! Why? I had the most fun playing it! Beat the last boss today and now going back to complete all challenges! 9.1
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	After a little over 15 hrs I feel like my score would be a little higher than IGN's (maybe an 8.5?). I love the game. It's much deeper, and harder than I expected it to be, too. It's not perfect, and I agree the controls are a little weird when it comes to some block puzzles, but overall I'm impressed and will be playing this one quite a bit. And bonus for me: my 3 old daughter likes to watch me play it. She asks too many questions, but at least I get to play a fun video game instead of watching another show about dinosaurs (she's obsessed with dinosaurs).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	My biggest issue is the moments of lag, where the game freezes before I execute my turns on some maps. Usually it's in areas with a lot of backgroud effects going on and it never lasts more that a few seconds, but it's frequent enough to break the immersion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	@Spoilsbury Really? I haven't had this happen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	I had a few drinks and I just bought it. Downloading now!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	@Exitmusic00 The best kind of purchases! lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	@Exitmusic00 That's part of the reason why my video game collection is so big.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	Was worried about World 3 given how many people I've seen complaining about it being a difficulty spike, but I've gotten Perfects on damn near every battle.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	T
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/28/mario-rabbids-kingdom-battle-review	I hate to admit it but I love Rabbid Luigi yelling Wooaaahh! at the end of every battle.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	IGN should be ashamed of themselves...  Gamer reviews are trashing this game.  On Xbox one, it has a 2.4 with twice as many 1 star reviews as 5 star reviews
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	Same thing every year...  The longshot story is okay, maybe if they expand on that story.  You could really make a whole game about a story such as that.  Oh wait, it would still be the same game because its still madden.  The last FOOTBALL game I was excited about was BLITZ THE LEAGUE.  That was awesome, and I wish they would come out with a new one.  I would rather play a football game like that with made up teams than play madden, which is the same game every year with an updated roster.  We seriously need competition for Madden, or nothing will ever change!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	this is my favorite madden in years. I'm loving the new engine 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	@brokeassgamer  Oh yea such a great madden.  My favorite part is when the blockers keep shuffling along and don't block, or when the receiver slides out of bounds.  What an amazing Madden  (Rolls eyes)  How about you get a holding penalty, and they only penalize you 6 yards?  Simming?  Oh, the Extra Point will get missed half the time! What a great game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	"@Rip42 @brokeassgamer well, sucks for you. i play in a league... we got the sliders set perfectly 

also good thing about franchise you can upgrade blocking and awareness... so blockers are smarter and better"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	I never had problems setting up substitutions in Madden 12, but then again I didn't have to jump from coach to coach and I could be any team at anytime during a Madden 12 franchise season game. Madden 18 has great graphics but the user friendly part of this game sucks! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	Can someone tell why I can’t set up substitute players in all 32 teams in offline franchise mode? I set substitute up in 15 teams and then the game wouldn’t accept my changes for the rest of my teams.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	Bring back espn 2k5!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	I have never written a review about anything in my life but I literally got the most furious about this game than I have ever been. Madden has forced everyone to buy into the same game every year with just different rosters and barely tuned gameplay! Why is there so many instances that can only happen by the computer.. like jetting across the turf 3 feet to get a pic! Why can't the game change in more ways than just a roster, seriously with all the money they get from the customers every year there should be so much more added! There's really nothing to be excited about in this game it's the same every year, even the announcers are the exact same as the last 2 years. If there was another video game developer that made another NFL video game I would buy it instead of this thieving company that makes it right now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	this game is awful, cant believe u gave such a stellar review for a 2hour movie they put in the game. WILL NEVER BUY MADDEN AGAIN!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	Madden 18 has to be one the worst substitution game I have every played! I substituted Tom Johnson DT of the Viking for DT Linval Joseph and went to practice Johnson in the formation that I gave him. Johnson wasn’t there but QB Sam Bradford was. Come on Man!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	@lefty1216  My lineman got injured for the Packers, guess who they put in to replace him?  Martellius Bennett
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/madden-nfl-18-review	"Coming from a Madden fan, this year feels more like an update with a new graphics engine.  Nothing new here, just the same game with a new roster.  The only new feature is the Longshot story mode which I found myself playing more than the actual game.  The stereotypes in the Longshot are hilarious.  Just to name a few

Devin looks like a Tyler Perry/Aaron Rogers hybrid who can't think for himself.
Devin makes the Longshot tv show by ""Intangibles"" and not by skills.
Cruises mother is a cross-eyed country resident from Texas.

They should have gave you the option to choose which race you want to be, but I guess EA is relying on black people who play Madden and NBA2K.  IMO.  Glad I rented this first."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/21/yakuza-kiwami-review	Having a great time with this one just like Yakuza Zero.  Too bad Majima isn't playable, but they do what they can to make up for it.  The Majima Everywhere stuff is hilarious.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/21/yakuza-kiwami-review	"What a dumb review.  Heidi has no idea what she's talking about in complaining about ""story pacing"" issues as the story was obviously intended to be told that way.  Why do only women review Japanese games when Japan has a notable misogynistic culture (especially as seen in the Yakuza series) and has a male dominated target audience?  It's like having men review bras and panties."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	Surely IGN reviews have zero impact on whether or not someone buys a game these days? This was probably marked down as it doesn't have Gone home moments like 4 that IGN rave about.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	@Deviltaz I played through Gone Home and found it the most boring experience I had in a long time. seriously would that game of even got half the hype if you didn't find out the protagonist was gay at the end ?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	@IgameWithClass @Deviltaz gone home is a piece of shit. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	I recently just got mine on sale from play-asia https://www.play-asia.com/uncharted-the-lost-legacy/13/70b3rp?tagid=1415491
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	Brilliantly worded. I thought the same thing. I thought Chloe and Nadine were a bit girly for my taste in an action game tho. I liked Sam, although they made him seem a bit goofy. The game only got good for me half way through. I give it a 7 - 7.5 as well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	"@Gravedigger78 im glad they were girly. i was expecting them to be butch... they actually came off like women! what a surprise! 

a woman can be strong/sexy and not be butch 

this game proves that "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	Aaahhhhhh !!!! 7.5 Really.... IGN! I have just played this game, and for sometime I have felt that the staff at IGN that review games, have really lost the point when they come to rating a Game. This game is beautiful, the story is awesome, the set pieces are great and the design layout that make all the puzzles tricky but not too tricky make you feel that a super treasure hunter. The shorten story, which lasted with my family, took us 8.5 hours to complete, and the fact we are now playing it again to platinum it, is worth every penny of the £21.00 we paid for it. Naughty Dog can't make a bad game... and a 7.5 is insulting. Anyone else feels that they off the make when reviewing games ( eg Alien Isolation 5.9 - ?????? )
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	Another thing... The open world section, is just one level... (Level 4 of the 9 in total). And the little sub treasure hunt was great. And Not even my 11 year old had problems climbing walls and rock faces. She never saw a section she thought she good climb but couldn't... It's not an world world game, but I liked the different design within this one level of the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	"The game was only £24 for me , and I enjoyed it more than uncharted 4 which is one of my favourite games
The review is way off 9.5/10 for me , if offers so much value ."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	"@StarOceanBlue i feel the same. def a 9ish game

WOW wasnt expecting that. this is the sleeper game of 2017"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/16/uncharted-the-lost-legacy-review	Uncharted 4 and co just wasn't the big exclusive the PS4 drones were hoping for.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	" So the nice goat mom turned into a broken heart, which made these people gush with emotions.  Is this IGN for kids?  What are these people talking about?!  How was this slideshow selected GOTY 2015?  I can see how something like this can be nominated for some weird category like “2D games from last century”, but 2015 game of the year?!  Am I missing something here? 

These reviewers have the minds of 5-year olds, and they sound like they just discovered the RPG genre.  These guys focus on some strange emotional aspect of the game, while ignoring what their eyes see (or they haven't played a game in the last three decades).  I had a hard time matching their emotional outbursts to the visuals they showed us.  Maybe I’m losing my mind.

IGN reviews need more balance and consistency.  There should be some baseline on which every game is judged, which should apply to all reviewers.  If a game is rated as a “masterpiece” because the reviewers completely ignored the visual aspect, they are being unfair to other more esthetically pleasing, and modern looking games that got lower scores because of something else.  This game looks worse than most modern games, so just based on that it cannot be a 10!  By the way, a game can be made to look and feel old-school, and still look great, but THIS is not it.  This is just cheap looking, with little or no effort put in the design, considering today’s standards and possibilities.  The reviewers ignore this aspect entirely.  This is BS. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	@unknown123_536957  I agree 100%
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	Ridiculous score for a game that looks as it was produced in the 80's.  IGN haven't got a clue.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	" It looks like it belongs on the Atari 2600 -- and I'm only slightly exaggerating.  You're giving this game ... a 10.  Out of ... 10.  What's the catch?  Is this a ""masterpiece"" for 1983?  Yes, it probably was.  Maybe that's what your reviewer meant.

I recommend that you fire whoever it was who chose this game to have this score, and then fire the editor who allowed this review to be published.  Anyone can arbitrarily choose some crazy niche game to ace the scoring system.  It's an entirely other matter to keep a standard that is followed by ALL the games that get reviewed!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	"This is good but it's not a 10. An how the fuck do they give this game such a high score for its narrative but only give ""to the moon"" a 7.5, when that game probably had a better one. It's a top down 2d game as well and it's the only game besides ff7 to ever make me cry. They Need more consistency"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	Ok, who gave who a BJ for a 10 score? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	What a true little gem; a yarn that will be knitting sweet-ass smiles on my mind for a while to come
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	A 10 for this has to be the joke of the year. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	You don't even game, bro
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	"Yea. This one makes no sense. IGNs going soft. I remember when a 10 meant ""HOLY SHIT IT GOT A 10!!!?"" Losing its luster these days"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	@Igniscorrupt11111636  Goddamn, though, this game IS a ten!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	 I tried this game on PC. I couldnt really grasp why people thought it was so amazing. Novel, for sure, but a masterpiece? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	Wonderful game. Inb4 kids looking for action ignoring how deep this story goes. There's a good reason why a lot of gaming authorities gave this game of the year 2015. It's a wonderful game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/undertale-review	This is a joke right?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"Finally! Beat this game tonight. Took me like 3 weeks. I enjoyed it... very much so. I do think that not all heroes are equal. For instance... i had Hollywood with me about 90 percent of the time... later on down the game i had to master some of the others, and some were just never as powerful or good. Hardtack is my prime example... besides his shotgun getting more range... i never felt any type of improvements with him (getting to level 19) with him. The Npcs and world could've been better... i loved the cartoony/saints row look... but not much effort went into the world (same with saints row 4) 

Besides that... i have no major complaints. Heroes are completely optional (for the most part) there are some missions where you need one that can break a shield (there's at least 4 of them that can do that) so you could play the entire game and never have to use the entire roster. The gameplay is fantastic... reminds me a lot of Saints Row 4's 

So besides a dull world... some under-powered characters... there's nothing that really bothered me too much . The frame-rate was also steady up until the last mission... there's an increase of enemies on screen... there's just a lot more going on. Besides that, the game runs smooth. 

my final score would be an 8 "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"GAME Looks FUN ???

IGN try reviewing a game without scoring it.
Then do a pole on what we think the score is.
Then release your score a week after release and see if we guess right.

Listening to the review I would have guess 8.6-8.8"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"@StephenSays i think it's a very good game. That's just me though... there are no major flaws... so i don't see why someone wouldn't give it an 8.5-8.8 

i think people forgot about fun factor. the game is fun... not everything needs to be a ""masterpiece"""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	I did not think I would have any fun with this game and its a total riot and a hoot.  love finding the backstory of the agents by doing the side missions and so far, solid experience
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@ewells32 finally beat it tonight. did you ever beat it? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"Ive officially put over 20 hours into this game... i would say it's a mid 8s (if i had to rate it now) < IGN STYLE 

i was hoping the story would've made me care more. but tbh i didn't buy this game for a ground breaking story... i bought it to have fun. the game is a lot like saints row 4 with more elements of an rpg... upgrades... crafting... loots boxes etc... 

i have no major complaints about this game. how any site could rate this game anything but GOOD is beyond me

Buy it if you haven't . Especially if you liked Saints Row 4"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"Several hours into it and its a blast.  My only complaints are less-than-ideal driving mechanics and the necessity of a Destiny-Like hub where you have to go to take care of most equip, upgrade, training, and operational functions.  It slows the action down a bit.
I wish games could learn from the Borderland franchise about functionality on the fly.
Overall, as someone who loves open world games as well as 3rd person shooters, I would personally give this game an 8.5 to 9.0.  I'm praying that there will be some awesome dlc down the road."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"Despite bad reviews around the net, I am loving this game!
I am a huge fan of open world, and volitions almost so bad its funny/good tone in many of their games.
A huge open world explody saturday morning esque wonderland!
If you ""get"" the saints row games, specifically 3/4, and love old school Saturday morning action cartoons, i think you may really enjoy this game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@baconlaserbeam absolutely agree. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@baconlaserbeam  I don't know about you, but I am fucking excited for Borderlands 3. Wow, Borderlands 1, and 2 were fun as hell. The Pre-Sequel was a let down but it still had it's moments. We need Gearbox to take it's time with Borderlands 3 to ensure it's the best it can be.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@baconlaserbeam I hate open world games with a passion, but this game and Zelda has proved to me that open world can indeed be fun, but, only when it is done right.  So far, this game does nail it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	Waiting for the $19.99 price or the $30 dlc edition. Yep.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@ArchStanton75 rough times? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	nope, undeserving shitty game

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	Even after the review i dont get what the game is about... Looks a bit simple minded, if its just about destruction (whats shown) then i dont think its for me 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@Tomas1980 Definitely simple minded in the same way that GTA5 is simple minded.  So def not for you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"@Hooch-is-Crazy @Tomas1980 Well i never played GTA5 more than 3h... But most likely because i seem to be a bit bored with the todays setting. Also theres pretty much stuff to do outside of destruction in GTA5. 
So by your comment Agents of Mayhem is a pretty immersive game ? Just havent seen that"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@Tomas1980 @Hooch-is-Crazy i don't know what you mean by immersive. but there's a lot of leveling up. there's like 9 characters... you can craft better weapons... each character plays differently... so there is some strategy... especially when you play on hard
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@brokeassgamer @Tomas1980 @Hooch-is-Crazy Well GTA5 is pretty immersive as a gameworld, hooch referenced the game to be like GTA5 (even though i dont consider gta5 to be that simple minded)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	You have never touched a gta in your life, am I right? It shows. A lot.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	Picked it up yesterday despite the mixed reviews. I wouldn't say that its an excellent game but very entertaining.  I would give it between a 7 or 8 but I would say one of the things that I like is that the developer said they would make future enhancements for the pro and X (bigger population etc).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	@clutch9k i don't think they were aiming to make  classic lol. it's just a fun game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/15/agents-of-mayhem-review	"There's no co-op. . .either you get over it, or you don't and ignore the game and buy something else.

I swear, it's like gamers these days no longer have the ability to enjoy gaming solo."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	"I wish they would make a sequel and include some of my favorite levels that didn't make it to this game:
- Sonic 1: Spring Yard, Scrap Brain
- Sonic 2: remake any of the scrapped levels from the popular Sonic 2 prototype (Hidden Palace would be good), Casino Night 
- Sonic 3: Ice Cap  Zone/Marble Garden/Carnival Night
- Sonic & Knuckles: Mushroom Hill/Sandopolis

I also wish they would remove the special levels that you chase a UFO - they are weird and boring. The special levels from Sonic 3/Knuckles are much more fun."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	Oh to have something like this done with Symphony of the Night.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	"This game is a great way of revisiting the Sonic classics from the 90s - kudos to Sega, they finally figured out what made Sonic great in the 1st place and made good use of it.

Not sure what's broken with the Sky Chase or the ""keep the lights on"" mechanism - I didn't think they were annoying in the 90s and I still think they are fine.

Favorite level is Flying Battery - it's both a throwback to that zone and to Sonic 2's Wing Fortress... And the theme is awesome!

If you're a Sonic fan this game is highly recommended."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	I wish that they would've set up the bonus options more like Sonic 3 Complete (especially regarding music themes). I actually hate the 1-up Jingle they chose would rather the first or third one instead. lol. The invincible theme was too short. They did spectacularly on the revamped levels and kept the essence of the best parts of each. Flying battery, Lava Reef, and Metallic Madness. Wow. I Liked Studiopolis. I would rather that Mirage Saloon's acts were longer and off of the tornado. Still don't understand what a press garden is but it was pretty good for a gaudy looking color scheme. Especially Loved Titanic Monarch (I wish they would've used more assets from Chrome Gadget than just the moon. lol). 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	@TruHoopstar13 Agree about the 1-up jingle and invincible theme (I wish they had used the old theme from Sonic 1/2 or Knuckles). Not sure why the speed up item now has its own theme, it was better just speeding up the zone theme
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	@sbaggio I would have given sonic the original jingles and tails and knuckles the other two. I think that they were trying to give some equity to the Sonic CD features as much as everything else. I actually wanted them to make sonic dash off of the screen like he did for that game on a few of the stages.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	"I've scrolled up and down the commentary seeing Nintendo fans taking time to cape for Mario and I'll say again what I said a few months ago. Sonic 3 & Knuckles is better than Super Mario All-Stars & World and Yoshi's Island and especially the NSMB series. It's amazing considering that the style was perfected in the early 1990s. The Mario games are probably more epic ""adventures"" than the Genesis/SCD Sonic games on average but S3&K told the best story with a simple prologue, transition scenes and a dynamic epilogue. It had had a superior action and exposition. Sonic impressed more with three elemental shields than Mario did with all of his cute situationally beneficial power-ups. Better boss fights from start to end (especially toward the end). Better and more subtle use of multiple characters (Tails-Easy, Sonic-Normal, Knuckles-Hard mode). Much more detailed level designs. Better musical themes.... and I absolutely LOVE the majority of the Super Mario games.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/14/sonic-mania-review	@TruHoopstar13 I definitely agree with you. I was always more of a Sonic fan but when Sega dropped the ball after Sonic Adventure, I became more of a Mario fan due to better quality games made by Nintendo.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/mega-man-legacy-collection-2-review	Mega Man 9, 4, and 3 are my faves. 2 is so overrated.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/mega-man-legacy-collection-2-review	@gamer4f4af1b9aa379  :  Nah, 2 is memorable for lots of reasons.  It got a louder reception compared to MM1, vastly improved the gameplay, the music was top notch, and I think those who got Nintendo Power magazine back in the day remember the brilliant, colorful artwork that went along with it.  2 and 3 are most memorable for delivering something pretty meaningful to the series.

The new challenges are a big improvement over the last collection. This time they are broken down by game, and shooting for the #1 spot on global leaderboards has never been more fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/mega-man-legacy-collection-2-review	I bought this game (along with a controller) at Gamestop the day it came out, at about 11:30 a.m. I didn't even realize until later that night I got the gutted display copy, much to my disgust. I normally make sure to ask for only a sealed copy but I thought being early on day one it wouldn't have been an issue. There was a little square scratch mark on the back in the center of the disc from being played by the employees, I'm sure. I should know better than to ever walk in there again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/mega-man-legacy-collection-2-review	@lightspeed_sg Not sure if it's the same as Game in the UK but if it is, the only reason there would be a gutted copy sold is due to there being no further copies to sell. So, it's a shame, but it's the only reason. Unless they had a newbie serving you and didn't know. Also - Might be different from store to store - But the employees don't tend to play games that would be low in stock. Purely because if it's in one of the display consoles and someone wants to buy the last copy, it'd be a hassle to get it packed up and sold. Could absolutely be someone being careless with gutting the game to begin with, which is also pretty bad
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/mega-man-legacy-collection-2-review	"@IAmDrummist @lightspeed_sg  This happened to me way back in the early 2000s with a copy of Digimon World 3.  I went in, bought the game, asked about their refund policy and he said as long as it's not open they'll take it back.  I waited for some reviews, saw it wasn't a very good game (heartbreaking to say the least) and brought it back to get a refund. 

The exact same guy who sold it to me only 2 days before then says he won't accept it because it was opened.  I told him I never opened it and then I looked and saw that they had given me the display/demo copy, already opened.  I told him (with all the fury and might of a 14 year old) that if they don't take it back I'll never shop at Gamestop again.  He laughed and told me to get out.

I have never shopped at a Gamestop since."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/08/mega-man-legacy-collection-2-review	"@MulliganNY @IAmDrummist @lightspeed_sg Whether you were 14 or not that was deceitful and disrespectful of him. Now with all these 20% off deals from Best Buy and Amazon Prime there's really no reason to shop at Gamestop except when they have an exclusive item. I went in there to buy the new Hori Switch controller, which wasn't available anywhere else except online,  and thought paying another $20 for MML2 would be a no risk factor, but those two girls I saw walking out right before me must have bought up whatever few sealed copies they had.

Especially as, even if you were to buy a gutted copy, there should always be one of those security seals on. So, not only was he a moron for patronising you, he was also a moron for not doing an extremely simple thing and seal up an opened box

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	 GIVE ME AN ENSLAVED SEQUEL!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	This truly is a wonderful game. I'm a horror fanatic and this game's twisted world is spot-on. Seriously, the only complaint I have is wanting more. This is a master class in game-making. Congratulations to Ninja Theory. This game makes the argument clear for why you want 60fps in your games! Best game I've played all year and one of the best experiences I've ever had playing video games overall! Strong recommendations!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@saint_sinatra3 Yeah, PS4 is on a roll this year!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	This game is beautiful. Easily the best game I have played this year. Very meticulous and deep attention to detail. The soundtrack fits perfectly. Side stories are consistent with Norse mythology. The psychological aspect adds a steady tension to the game that often makes you forget that is in fact a game. The perma-death systems adds to  the stakes that makes you considerate of your every action. I love the simplicity of the game ( No HUD, no health meter, simple yet unforgiving combat0. Though this is not a long game, this is easily the best game I have played this year.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@Matt_johnson3rd Yup!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"I liked the game but I do think that this rating is a bit high. It really felt to me like they spent a lot of time building an immersive experience and forgot that it's still a game. The combat is very simple, and while functional, the small number of enemy types and how infrequent the combat is makes it feel like an after thought. This would be fine if there were more meat to everything else. It's incredibly linear and there's really just one type of ""puzzle"", something that becomes a bit frustrating the 10th time you've done it; not because it's hard but because you'll approach and be like ""another door?!"" It's beautiful but feels like there should be more to see or do. It's one of those things where a score needs to be broken down into sections because graphics, visuals, and audio would get high marks but gameplay would be lower because there frankly isn't much."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	Exactly my kind of game but will never buy due to permadeath threat....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	It's not real. It's a lie the game tells you to inflict anxiety to the player much like Senua.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@WaffeMak3TOAST On the contrary, every time i died in the game i got an animation of the rot growing. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@Raphtor  You'd have to be terrible for this to really be an issue. I played on the hardest difficulty and never had an issue with the combat. It's simply not that hard. Some of the puzzles are more likely to kill you than the enemies and if death by combat IS an issue for you, just lower the difficulty.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@Raphtor You missing a real treat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"@Raphtor LMAO yeah right...You're afraid of a ""perma death"" feature in a game so you wont buy it?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"Glad this article spent so much time talking about graphics and atmosphere.

I spent an obscene amount of time in the very first area just marveling at the visuals. Truly very well executed. Ninja Theory should be proud. This game stands out from the pack visually.

Now, I'm playing on the PC version, so my experience might be a little different:

Maybe it's not present on PS4, but on PC, the photo mode gives an amazing opportunity to really appreciate the graphics even further, and I'm really disappointed it's not mentioned here. Senua is not only a beautiful woman, but a truly beautiful piece of art.

The model and textures obviously have been pored over meticulously; probably to the point of agony. 

The streaks of dirt and paint on her face are perfectly organic, and if you play with the exposure and Post FX just right, you can make find some truly staggering images. 

Hell. I spent probably fifteen minutes just looking at her leather headband. They got all of the textures and topology PERFECT. The 3D artist responsible for this masterpiece is a GOD."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"@JEJoll  Photo mode is there, and it does look amazing on the PS4. Not sure if it looks any better on PC, I wouldn't be surprised if it does but at the same time it looks good enough on the ps4 that I doubt I'd be able to tell the difference.

I'm not sure I would say that Senua is a ""beautiful"" woman by any stretch. But that's alright because I don't think she really has to be because she's interesting. 

My biggest criticism for the game is some of the live action video mixing looks very awkward. The live action characters move.. well like a person would in real time, where Senua being animated looks slow and sluggish by comparison. It didn't bring me out of the experience very often, but there were 1 or 2 scenes where the live action looks... well cringy.  If you're only a few hours in, you likely haven't seen it yet.

The combat falls off pretty hard after awhile. It always looks great in motion, but towards the end it starts to get exhausting. Especially in some of the later boss fights and scenes leading up to them.  There are just too many enemies on screen for the camera/targeting to handle. As a result, Senua will frequently switch targets mid-dodge or swing, causing you to miss or turn your back on an enemy who is swinging at you. At that point, it feels rather sluggish and exhausting. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	That never happened to me during combat. I was able to manage the enemies and the camera successfully. And, hell, anytime an enemy did end up behind me, the voices would help! Lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@saint_sinatra3  Have you beaten the game? The last boss fight in particular when you get mobbed, or even the one before that when you're fighting the shadow bosses, the camera seems ill equipped to handle both of them running through you at the same time (which they do repeatedly throughout the fight). You'll be in a good rhythm, then have to dodge, and then your camera will randomly select which of the 2 bosses to focus on (generally the closer) while the other one destroys you from behind. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@Crash486 @JEJoll Does your PS4 have a 1080ti?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@blazeaglory @Crash486 @JEJoll  No, but my PC does. And when I play MegaMan on my PC it looks the same as when I play it on my PS4. Hardware is not the only determining factor for how a game looks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	Does anyone else feel like this game is starting rather slowly?  I know the review score is the opinion of just 1 person but I hope this game lives up to its score.  However I am about an hour in and it seems pretty boring.  Does it pick up?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"@deesnutz99  Depends. The puzzles become more interesting as you go on, but they are still puzzles. If you don't like puzzle solving then that part is not going to pick up. The combat gets better, but towards the end when they've introduced you to every enemy type, and it just begins to throw waves of them at you in 5 minute fights, it becomes repetitive. I will say, the game has one of the coolest boss fights of any game I've played this generation. You really need to be playing with headphones to appreciate it, but it was awesome. 

In short, if you don't like the puzzle gameplay, ask yourself why. If it's because you don't like the pacing or solving puzzles in general, then it's never going to really get better. If it's because the puzzles seem uninteresting, then it gets better as they get more interesting. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"Another fine example of what its possible when unleashing the latent potential of videogames. 

Hellblade puts you inside Senua's schizophrenic, mind but it's not just another psychological horror. It actually marries the subject of psychosis perfectly with the historical context set on the Viking age, an age of pagan gods, ruthlessness and superstition. This merciless world makes Senua's often doubt her perception, not just because of her condition, but because of the inborn superstition which gripped all of humanity during the dark ages. 

But superstition alone doesn't make it any less merciless for Senua, who needs to struggle with her past and the cold, unforgiving present. The game actually makes you feel in your skin the journey she must face. The experience is so real and haunting, it actually makes you physically fatigued - not because of the gameplay, but because of real psychological stress the game constantly puts you through.

Hellblade is definitely the engrossing experience of the year, for me personally, and for many others. It fulfill the basic obligations of any game, but it goes beyond. Anyone playing can see right away in the first 5 minutes of play-though that this is no ordinary game, it's an experience. For me, this is where I draw the line when a game stops being just a game, and becomes art."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	sounds another reason to pissed at myself for sticking with XBOX instead of going back home to Sony
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	@kbett I dont think this game is full exclusive.  I remember reading this was a console launch exclusive and the devs have spoken about it coming to Xb1
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"@deesnutz99 @kbett Back in 2014 they used some info that said ""launching on consoles first on PS4"" or something to that effect which is why there's a sliver of hope for it being released on Xbone. There hasn't been any other mention of that, but there is that hope for people. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/07/hellblade-senuas-sacrifice-review	"This game was well worth the $30. Incredible visuals and even better audio work. I would have absolutely payed a full $60 to get a more fleshed out world and combat system. 
Not the game for you if you only like open world games or multiplayer but if you're looking for an impeccable story driven game with fun combat and a beautiful world, look no further. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	"The VR version is a mixed bag for me. The issues were:

The need to repeat earlier scenarios when you get killed, instead of the one you were on, was incredibly frustrating and became very boring.  I gave up on the level that starts with the dancing pole.

The game didn't respect the guardian boundaries.  I ended up hit things with my hand (in the real world).

Also the game always starts far to close to the front edge of my space, limiting my movement forward in any way."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	I've played this. The concept is cool. But the graphics/visuals are so plain it gets instantly boring. I'm giving VR another 5 years until some proper visuals get delivered.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	@The_Apothecary i think u miss the point. The graphics on this game r done like that on purpose.. not because they couldnt make it better...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	@Runlikehell @The_Apothecary  Fair enough, just giving my opinion, I went in like 'im about to amazed' and was instantly let down by under polished art direction.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	@The_Apothecary  There are some decent games out there with decent visuals now.  Farpoint was pretty good, Star Trek Bridge Crew (despite limited content) actually looked decent although character designs could have been better, and Eve Valkyrie looks amazing.  The expansion to Battlefront...flying around in an X-wing...looks fantastic and it brought a childhood dream for me to life.  I've played that X-wing mission to death and hoping Battlefront II does a couple more, because DICE NAILED it.  Also, Resident Evil VII was...WOW!!!!  I think good visuals are on the horizon, not 5 years away. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	@Maek123 @The_Apothecary  X-Wing sounds cool.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/04/superhot-vr-review	@The_Apothecary @Maek123  Totally was...it's a 15-20 minute long mission, but I played it to death.  Making an attack run on a Star Destroyer, I'd look out the left side and trail my view toward the rear until my view was obscured by my wing/astromech droid behind me until I would wheel around and make another pass on the turbolasers.  Immersion is complete and looks/feels AMAZING.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	great review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	"After about 20 hours, finally got to the Nether (assuming this is the end region of the game). And I am pretty close to throwing in the towel, ala Darkest Dungeon. You have to clear out three rooms in succession with basically nowhere to move and hundreds of the meteors flying around, and any death makes you start it all over again.

Honestly not sure what to do at this point short of doing massive amounts of leveling. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	"I feel like I'm playing a revamped Advance Guardian Heroes and I love it.  Thousands of games require you to find power-ups to continue like Zelda, and just as many are open world and non-linear.  But only a few give you the great combat and Epic Boss fights of Advance Guardian Heroes.  And combat aside, from the collecting crystal like souls to power up, the sky warriors and floating eyeballs, and the creepy voice talking in your head, these two games have alot in common.  The boss fights aren't as epic as some of the ones in Advance Guardian Heros, all 4 are pretty much the same fight in Sundered, but no FPS loss.

On Insane difficulty it is just a farming game though.  I'm 45% done and I cannot even contest a boss.  I'm missing the grappling hook and perks, but mostly I just farm an arena over and over...boring.  And yesterday's update made that even harder.  In fact I don't recall one thing in the update that didn't make this already difficult game even more difficult.  Oh yeah, the shrines, they are nice, and the damage cap, but I barely notice as I'm being slaughtered in temple areas."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	"@Irenicus785 @Ralecus I hope you enjoy it.  I'm not sure which game is better, but I'm still enjoying Sundered.  And I played AGH so much, making sure I beat it on every difficulty so I could get the alternate start screen :)  I'm doing well on Insane now, just over 15 hours and I have defeated 2 bosses and grabbed every upgrade.  You must remember you're supposed to die, rinse, and repeat.  Basically I start off a run with an objective to reach a switch, or a perk before dying.  The boss fights seem overwhelming but you don't need to focus on them until endgame.  I explored all 3 areas before going back to the first area to fight it's boss.

BTW Irenicus is one of my favorite villians.  He's up there with Darth Vader for me, epic voice, epic power...he made BG2.  He was the kind of sorcerer my friends and I aspired to make but never could."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	I've heard the combat in this game is an exercise in frustration. I've also heard that the randomized levels mean backtracking due to death is equally frustrating. The last thing I want after I die is more frustration. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	this title is amazing to view...thanks ign
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	I really wish IGN would start reviewing more of the recent indie titles.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	@member74895 I got bored the first hour too.  However, I kept going and ended up fighting my first boss within 1:30 minutes into the game.  It was a mini-boss, and my viewers on Mixer loved it.  They decided to stick around for the rest of the journey.  Quite fun after that first hour.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	I really HATE the random enemies coming out of nowhere. There's no relation between the enemies and the terrain except in a few boss areas. It robs you of that satisfaction of clearing an area that you should get from a metroidvania. There's one enemy that attacks you from far off screen-- even from inaccessible areas--that was a particularly terrible, lazy idea.  I wish they'd just stuck to the Metroidvania formula combined with their amazing art style.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	@pinkincide3 I got a hunter (sniper) spawn between green spikes.  Had to swipe once and back off and kill him little by little.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	I really am loving this game, but I really do have to say what is up with the loading times!? I kind of hope they maybe stream line it with an update because come on. Aside from that definitely worthy of ones time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	@slayerfoy I'm currently programming a video game and I'm at the part where I need to code the procedural generation of grass. I coded some basic rules for the program to follow in order to have realistically spread grass and that alone added 3 minutes of load time. The load times are long because the algorithm generating content and design for the game is complex. This complexity is essential otherwise the game would have non-sensical levels and content. Hope that explains it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	"@if_statement @slayerfoy you still have to bow down to consumer demands and competition.

Nobody is going to accept a 3 minute load time due to grass and sales will plummet."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	"@psfourthewin @if_statement @slayerfoy this is why procedural generation is not topping the charts for popularity.  No Man's Sky  deals with it by vigorous use of pop-in rendering, making for an ugly game while flying. 
I think if game designers want to use procedural generation, they should apply it in studio, hand pick the best dungeons, tweak and refine them, and then have 500 pre-generated dungeons in the can ready to load.  Bloodborne's balanced this well with its chalice dungeons, where only a few dungeons had randomization, and the randomization was not extensive.  We still paid for it in the form of the lack of variation in the art design, a stark contract to the main game. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	@psfourthewin @if_statement @slayerfoy I totally agree. I just wanted to explain the reason why the load times in Sundered are high because slayerfoy asked. Btw the load times in my game are now much much faster after tweaking the algorithm. Plus I've now added procedurally generated rocks and hills. I plan to add shallow and deep water, and sand next, build worlds from there. If they were to reduce the load times in Sundered they would have to compromise on the quality of the procedurally generated content. This would also be perceived as negative by consumers and place the game behind competitively. There is a balance to be aimed for and the devs have chosen that the current load time and content quality is what they consider the best for their game. As CPUs and hard drives (although this one has been lagging badly) become more powerful the load times would be reduced. In the meantime we have no choice but to trust the devs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	@CthulhuChile666 @psfourthewin @if_statement @slayerfoy You have a point about mixing procedural generation and custom content and design. This is how most games are made today. In the case of a small studio or just one indie guy, like me with a full-time job and who programs on the side, relying more on procedural generation can be a good thing depending on how it is done. I cannot imagine all the time it would take to custom design all levels in my game. It is important to design an algorithm that will avoid repetition in content and level design as much as possible, and also affect gameplay in a positive way (thinking of environment layout and interaction with characters and enemies). When done right you get games like Spelunky, Crypt of the Necrodancer and Don't Starve. Pop ups don't have to be present in a game if all the content is loaded into memory before the player gains control of the character in a level. This is easier done in a 2d game but it mostly comes down to how the levels are fragmented in the game. For example, my game has a huge world divided in regions. Before entering a region all the content is loaded into memory. Which means no pop ups. In No Man's Sky they wanted to make a huge open world with no loading screens. That was a design decision and the trade off for loading screens was popups.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	@if_statement @CthulhuChile666 @psfourthewin @slayerfoy Do you have develop diaries or anything similar for you game? A place where we can see what you're talking about? Genuinely interested in what you're game looks like. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/27/sundered-review	@WonGJonG @if_statement @CthulhuChile666 @psfourthewin @slayerfoy Unfortunatly, I don't have any of those. Partly because I don't have the time (because I also have a full-time job and most days come back home with my brain about to collapse, I sleep 3 hours per night on week days to get things done) and because things posted on the internet depending on what website you post them on can be own by the company owning the website. When you sign up they have you accept contracts to create the account and some contracts mentions that they then own the content you post. So they could sue me when I release my game saying that I signed up to the contract. Also I am programming my game little by little. I never studied programming (I studied Science and later on Management, and I work in Finance :) ). Everything I know in programming I've learned on my own because I love it. I have been programming since I was 12. I am now 32. Right now the game is functional but the graphics are crap because I am not focusing on graphics but the functionality of mechanics in the game. It's a 2d procedurally generated open world rpg. I want the game to be more about exploration and story rather than fight, fight. I want combat to be smart, strategic, meaningful and rare (although I'm planning to allow players to choose how rare). Anyway, menus are done (pc centric with mouse + keyboard but I will also program menus for controller). Combat system is bare bones but at least I started programming it :). I am now programming the procedural level generation. After that I will be programming procedural quests. They will not be generic and repetitive. I have come up with a procedural quest design concept that I have never seen in any game I know of so far. I think I will license this before releasing the game. After that I will be polishing all the features I have programmed and adding new ones over time, even after the game is released.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	Great game. My GotY so far.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	I'm confused... they kept going on about how it improves on splatoon 1, yet it received a lower score. Did I miss something?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	"@JacksonCat  
The original Splatoon originally got a 7.9 which was only boosted to a 8.6 after all the updates were implemented, this entry will probably get the same treatment."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	They are showing a huge prejudice if they do that. Other deserving games don't get re-reviews. IGN trashed Borderlands 2 on Vita for its frame rate yet it was fixed just a couple days later. DriveClub was fixed too & got some free dlc yet didn't get a re review. Splatoon deserved higher than a 7.9 to begin with, not a bogus re review. Personally I would give Splatoon 2 a 9.5.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	"@captainexplosion69  
The difference between Splatoon and other games is that Nintendo made it clear what they were doing with Splatoon so despite reviewers criticizing the game for its lack of content, assured everyone that more content will come for free, they just weren't sure how much. Other games launching with bugs/problems and remedying it later on is a completely different scenario because there's no guarantee that devs will fix it"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	@abHS4L88 @JacksonCat  After some updates are made Nintendo will have a talk with IGN, pay em a wad of cash, and then they'll increase the score.

Lol, this idea that Nintendo (or any publisher) pays for a score is completely stupid, Nintendo doesn't even have much to gain from IGN boosting the score months later, especially since Metacritic doesn't update, IGN's score on there for the original is still a 7.9. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	I didn't play DriveClub until after it was out for some time, and I thought it was great, and still play it somewhat regularly. Was it really that bad at launch?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	Don't know how that could possibly change anything since those matches just either didn't count or just cancelled each out. I won about a dozen more matches than I lost and most of them had nearly the same power level.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/splatoon-2-review	"@Fox86 Don't think anyone can really claim it made a difference but two thirds of people were on team ketchup and so lots of people seemed to struggle to get a match with the other side which I think was more of an issue.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/pyre-review	9.7 for that ? LOL This game is good but never worth more than a 7.5 - 8 / 10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/pyre-review	There are a number of great features of the game - not least of all the music and visual style - but the game-play is seriously flawed in a number of respects. First, the lack of companion AI and the fact that you can only control one character at a time makes the emphasis on teamwork mostly a sham. As a number of others have noted, the most surefire tactic is simply to choose a fast character and run it into the other team's pyre. Second, the game's difficulty spikes enormously about half way through the game. One of the ways it does so is through extremely inorganic or arbitrary mechanisms, such as making it so that the other team starts with more hp/pyre points. Finally, the game lags on the ps4 in the later stages - there are serious moments of delay that can cause you to lose the ball/orb. I would say the game is mediocre or perhaps good, because as compelling as the narrative is, the matches are at best serviceable.  While I appreciate SuperGiant's commitment to maintaining a small team, they should really consider investing in additional or better AI programmers. This game, in short, suffers from style over substance.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/24/pyre-review	"@hain0088 I did get some lag in the final battle, it was so fast with so much happening so quickly the game actually couldn't keep up at times!

This is only an HD North American localization of a version of FF12 that was released in 2007 (Final Fantasy XII International Zodiac Job System) with hardly any additions (if any at all).
 Saying game mechanics that would've been nice to have added are Cons seems to me that your expectations were that it would be a new and different version than the 2007 re-release that NA never got. It's simply unfair to see these things as a downfall when they were never intended, promised and should not have ever been expected. 

Perhaps a lack of knowing/research caused the reviewer to not realise this, I won't make that sort of assumption. But it's kinda like expecting a little known Jackie Chan movie only released in China to have a better story now that it's getting an North American release for the first time in HD in about 10 years.

It's poor management of expectations I feel like we all see in too many reviews across too many products, not just video games.

I'm not the biggest gamer anymore, a lad is kicking on in his years and truth be told, I've only actually completed 2 games thus far for PS4. ( Fallout 4 & DAI ). In all honesty, I just look for games like fable, seeing as thought I still class that game the bees knees.

In rambling on like this, what I'm tring to get at is, I find this game insanely boring, compared to the 3 mentioned above. Having to go into a menu every time you want to attack some cuzzy feels like I'm a kid sitting on my Sega megadrive, then I just stand there while my lad attacks once every 3 minutes.

I can't help but feel I've missed something vital, seeing as though everyone gives it a solid wrap. Feel obliged to point out exactly where I've got the downs!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	"@jimmyboiiii Just as you said it yourself, you are not a ""hardcore gamer"". Those titles you mentioned, are far less RPG than their previous instalments and more action games. That require less planning, meddling with menus and etc. To sum it up, it's just not your genre and don't worry about it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	My personal Favs: Final Fantasy IV, VI, III, V, VII, and Final Fantasy IX. Haven't played This one yet. Might play FF X & X-2 first. But rapped up in E.S. 6 Skyrim and Dragon quest 7 at the moment. All the while, sometimes working up to 3 part time jobs. Still want to try out FF XII someday.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@wicket09 This game out long time ago but my first impression was like playing a single player FFXI Online
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	This game is certainly more than 0.6 points better than Final Fantasy 15.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@KINDERFLED this game is way better than 15
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@Unckie @KINDERFLED it's unfair to compare a game that had enough development time with the one that was released in almost unfinished state with so many things cut out of the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@Mr.Murmandramas @Unckie @KINDERFLED I hope you're not referring to 15 as the game that didn't have enough development time... Pretty sure they spent around 10 years on that game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	"Apparently, the best version of IGN's favorite final fantasy is less than a 9. Which would indicate that every final fantasy would also score lower than an 8.8

I'm usually not a stickler for review numbers, just surprised with IGN after taking the bold stance last year that final fantasy 12 is the best iteration."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	"@Bipolarcow The reviewer doesn't speak for everyone at IGN, plus games lose their appeal over time. Other jrpg's have improved on the formula since FFXII. Saying that I am liking XII at lot more second time around.

Edit - And I'm sure VI was listed as the best?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	Good review. I have not played it so hopefully it does not disappoint like FFX, FFXIII, and FFXV.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@BERT0503  FFX rocked.  Dafuq you smokin?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@FanboyPsychologist @BERT0503 The actual story was underwhelming. Barely comparable to the greatness of FFVI or FFVII. I hate the storyline and didn't care for the lame main character. It was too easy, too linear. Even the combat system was nothing innovative. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	"@BERT0503 @FanboyPsychologist taking into account your avatar, you will probably like this FF as it has many common points with Xenoblade.

And concerning FFX - it's combat system was a polished version of that in FFVII and VIII. As for the story, i didn't really appreciate it when i was a kid, but few years later, when hd version came out, i gave it a second try and enjoyed the game despite the main hero."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@BERT0503 XIII is my favourite FF game. I don't care what anyone says. The combat system was brilliant.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@spikerules @BERT0503 Now you know how some people feel about FFX...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/10/final-fantasy-xii-the-zodiac-age-review	@BERT0503 If you didn't like those games you will probably love this.  Enjoy 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	One of the most fun components of Elite Dangerous is Close Quarters Combat.  I would encourage PS4 players to join the CQC Discord.  Players go to the PS4 channel to try to organize games - it takes 4 to start a game.  Once enough PS4 players join the Discord getting a game started will be easier.  https://discord.gg/sbMy2hG
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	Tip of the day:  If you can't find the right external landing pad on a platform-style station, back off a bit, and use your elevation control (Right Stick up and down) and go the opposite way on your camera (Left Stick) and you'll orbit the station while aiming at it, so you'll find the landing pad easily.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	Sony dropped the ball not investing in PSVR support for this game... ED needs VR, third person mode, and voice commands.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	@SupremeDude The game already has serious performance issues as it is. Makes it highly unlikely that it ever could support PSVR (where a steady framerate is an absolute must).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	@JimboBimo @SupremeDude What performance Issues, perfect for me apart from bugs with game mechanics... and how can you tell it's not performing? on a PS4 where does it tell you about the Framerate issues and performance???
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	@SupremeDude @JimboBimo exactly right. Couldnt have said it better... how can u tell it has seriojs performance issues? And psvr is a must for this. It would sell like hot cakes. Do u remember the star wars short demo? That thing was a dream to play... if they made it in a simmilarway to play on psvr.... it would have been good times ahead
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	@Runlikehell @SupremeDude @JimboBimo Fingers crossed Alien Isolation gets a update or Alien isolation 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	"@SupremeDude @Runlikehell @JimboBimo Even on the ps pro the game has a hard time hitting 60 fps. Expecting this to be a thing on psvr is highly unlikely.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	the only thing this game has going for it is it inspires little children who lived in the so called star galaxy age. the 80s. and want more and more.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	Really impressed with this game, played it since early access on pc. Hell I bought it on ZX Spectrum in 1984 for that matter. Bought it again on PS4, it's a cracker, fires my imagination of being a space explorer just a much s it did when I was 12. In addition the community is the best I have ever seen, Facebook groups are full of fellow CMDRs from all platforms offering tips and sharing experiences, not a damn idiot fanboy or master race idiot in sight. Frontier should be proud of what they have made here.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	Far to boring for most console players i would imagine. All do is basically work towards a better ship.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	@Mr_Genicide I play on Xbox one and love the hell out of this game. I agree with you though most console gamers wouldn't even know where to begin with this game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	"You will get out what you put into this game. It can be wide as an ocean and as deep as a puddle or deep as the mariana trench depending on how much you put in. The learning ""curve"" is also more like a learning cliff lol... I can't see many of the traditional console players getting into this and enjoying it tbh. You kind of need an attention span to play the game."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	@Gods_Anus PS4 player here. I cried in joy when I saw it coming for my console. But I know what you mean... not your average console public
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	"@Gods_Anus  i don't know where people get this myth that console players have lower attention spans.
what study showed you this?

how is there any correlation between what system you game on and how much patience you have?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/07/07/elite-dangerous-ps4-review	Played this game in the Oculus Rift with a hotas. Even that after a while became boring. They need more to do. IMO. Some people may be fine with it the way it is.

I also hate how they lock basic patch worthy updates like the improvement to the map as a DLC exclusive feature.

But at the end of the day people like me will throw money at them because they're Nintendo, only I don't think that will last.

If it wasn't for Nintendo being a big part of what we gamers as kids grew up with and they were just a new company, people would see them for what they really are.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review	 i wanna know why you decided to give it a 8.5. The game should be like a 6. I dont remember none of these levels. Spyro had so much content! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review	I'd love to see Sony take a page from Nintendo and make a PS1 Mini. Ps1 had tons of great games on that system. I love Retro stuff...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review	@Valkana PS3 is basicaly a PS1 Mini Extra
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review	@Valkana You are right. That would be a good idea. I don't think it would sell as well though since most games are on the PS Store.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review	 I tells ya', game companies can stay in business for decades just putting out reboots. It's amazing how nostalgia drives gamers to pay for the same game twice.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	No thanks Sega, I'm not even going to show any interest towards this game. Instead, I'm off to play Valkyria Chronicles for the second time on my PS4. Because with VC, it has a well-written, heart-wrenching narrative, excellent characters and some damn fine strategical gameplay. None of which seems to be offered in this game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	 Valkyria Revolution for me the biggest disappointment in 2017 or more like a decade.  IGN however is always the biggest disappoint.  Gamespot was catering to developers' money/pressure and it's all but dead now, and IGN is doing exactly the same thing.

Be released on Xbox one"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	@TheRisingSon I wouldn't say it sucks... it's like FF8, a pretty average JRPG, nothing special. Worth picking up on sale IMO, even though it's already priced at 40.00, i'd say it's worth 30.00
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	"@TheRisingSon I usually respect Leif Johnson's opinion. You guys are always saying ""IGNs"" opinion when if you spend anytime on this site you should be getting to know some reviewers and staff.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	"I remember being stoked for this when I first heard mention of it , having just experienced VC remastered on ps4 (completely missed its first go on ps3).
Such a shame to be disappointed, they didn't even keep the art style . I can only hope this doesn't kill of the Valkyria series altogether.
Would love to play another chronicles style game on console"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	"so lacklustre... the story (getting the ending at the beginning of the game.. i hate that. so they all die, thanks for that) and then cringeworthy speeches and over the top drama.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	this hack n slash style of gameplay doesn't suit this game. Where's the strategy like other VC.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	Play the other VC you'll see the difference. And the others VC are way better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	" I have to admit, this game is fun. Played it for a couple of hours, didn't regret my purchase.

But my god it has so many issues, all listed here. Good thing this mess isn't happening on Gallia.

While I also believe VC1, 2, and 3's combat system had flaws too (mixing turned based strategy and a 3rd person shooter is NOT easy), they probably should of put some time into the 4th main game of the series instead of some glorified anime massacre simulator."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/26/valkyria-revolution-review	Anyone that has a passing interest and love for the Valkyria Chronicles franchise already had his/her heart broken many months ago when youtube videos of the japanese version became available and it was quite apparent that this was a bad, bad game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/23/nex-machina-review	@Coltaine22 @RetroManHD A lot of AAA games rely on cut scenes or focus on graphics but the gameplay suffers as a result. Those games are not very creative and don't have much replay value. They're more like tech demos.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	It's the same stupid and boring game of all the time. how the heck got a 9,5?. ign rate games for how they good are, of how popular they are?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	Why doesn't it use the touchscreen for inventory management?! The Wii U version ALSO lacked this feature, which is sad, because it's a feature that would really help this version excel. It's just a baffling decision.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	So what about world size? Can you build out to the same size as the PS4 and X1 versions?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	"A 9.5? Really? Own multiple versions of this game. I am not the biggest fan but I do acknowledge its validity of being a game that allows for endless creativity and provides a cool randomized level generator. However, in the switch version, I find its performance to be a big issue. Draw distance is absolutely awful and takes away from the sense of worldliness to the land I am creating in or trying to survive in. I can walk off of a mountain 100 paces in one direction, turn around and the mountain is gone! It really takes me out of the game. Visual Performance limitations are a deterrent for me and I'm sure many others. At this point I still think we can do better here as I would like to see a, as they like to call it. ""Definitive"" console experience on the go."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	"Man, you guys should score a game based on what it really is, not because it's a huge phenomenon. By this standard you should have scored the Transformers movies 9's, because they make a ton of money and kids like them. Minecraft has no sound, no story, bad graphics, and honestly? There's really little gameplay there as well. It's just fun for kids to screw around with. Did you give Roblox a 10.0 because that's quickly catching up to Minecraft in popularity, even though it's a buggy mess.

I don't hate Minecraft. I don't play it, but I'd rather see an honest review where this gets like a 6.5, because that's really what it is."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	@PrincePlusRevolution Lol, the old I don't like the game so any good review isn't honest stance. You wasted a lot of words on a game you don't play.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	@PrincePlusRevolution Are you an idiot? Roblox is older than Minecraft and has never came close to the sales power of this game, plus saying you havent played it but it should be rated this score, shows how much common sense you lack. No sound? wtf are you smoking lmao. Im not a big fan of this game either but thats cause personally i get bored pretty fast. Its fun nonetheless, and can provide hundreds of hours of entertainment to the right people. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	 9.5 seems like an incredibly strange score for a lackluster port
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	@JM97 You must not have heard of the Super Mario Mash-Up Pack...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	Man, when will Nintendo stop sucking with multiplayer. They can just never pull out all the stops like the other consoles do.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	So is minecraft now play anywhere/any device cross play? (Cept sony apparantly) I saw a big thing about that at e3, Im asking because its not mentioning it anywhere....really cool if so
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	@G0tHiCm3rCy We are getting that update in August.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	It's the #1 selling game on Eshop right now. So at least its selling well. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	@ClassicGaming89 It sold really well on Wii U too. Minecraft is loved by everyone.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	Yea its real addictive...i pick it up and play on my xb all the time
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	9,5. Minecraft. Alanah Pearce being Alanah Pearce...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/minecraft-switch-edition-review	@TocasiaKO More like Minecraft being Minecraft. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	" Also i love how the pic reminds me of the animated short video on youtube where the Switch is like ""I have no competition!"" Then shows the PC next to it saying ""I AM A GTX 1080"". XD They are perfect together. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	Good on Nintendo :) It's nice to see the young blood at the company slowly transforming it back into one that's willing to take genuine risks with top-flight creativity. Hope they keep it up.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@JasonVanVoorhees Must not be your type of game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	I have to admit that I thought I wouldn't like it but its some how actually good. I cant wait for the DLC to drop. Oh yeah, the lobbies are a game changer
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	Wanted to like it, bought it, tried it, didn't like it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Pokeparkranger  That makes me sad.  I love the game to death - sorry you didn't get the same enjoyment.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@trevor_moe @Pokeparkranger That's ok. To each his own. Glad you like it! I'm looking forward to Splatoon 2 :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Pokeparkranger Fighting games are not for everyone.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@BERT0503 @Pokeparkranger Fighting games are fine. I love MTP, Mortal Kombat, Smash Bros, Street Fighter, Bushido Blade, etc. But ARMS is just too slow and the controls are cumbersome. That doesn't make for a very fun fighting game for me. Glad others are enjoying it tho.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Pokeparkranger @BERT0503 It's actually not a slow game once you get the hang of it. Matches can be very quick when you have 2 very skilled players going against each other. It's intense.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@BERT0503 @Pokeparkranger I know the matches are over quick. I meant the movements are slow, the punches, etc. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Pokeparkranger @BERT0503 Not slow at all. It's all physics. They are not superheroes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	"@BERT0503 @Pokeparkranger Didn't say they were, and well...gee all fighting games are ""physics"".  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Pokeparkranger yeah played solo for 1 hour got bored and can't be arsed with app bollocks with phone to play online.  I will try when mates are round might be fun if we are all drunk.  But does look dull to be fair its got a high review as its a Nintendo game.  But hopefully folks are enjoying it.  looking forward to mario.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	As a strictly Nintendo-only gamer I can say that I find this amazing. We get this awesome exclusive and what do PS4 gamers get.......Last of Us 2 and yet another God of War...........yawn. The Nintendo Switch is the only real console to own this gen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@keytarhero LOL! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@keytarhero lmao, this is a pony intending to sound smart, not knowing what he said is in fact true, LoU and sony exclusives all look and play the same and are the ultimate yawn inducers.  At least Nintendo makes GOATs like BOTW, MK8D, SMASH Bros and Mario Odyssey as well as innovative and fun games like ARMS and Splatoon. True gaming heaven is Nintendo plus PC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Obama64 @keytarhero I'm going to get into PC gaming soon also as I now live in my mom's basement and have $1000's of dollars to spend on video cards every year.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	So it's a 6 right?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Zero_Day  You have it upside-down.  Closer to a 9.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/07/arms-review	@Zero_Day It actually deserves at least a 9, points deducted are mostly for being light on content, which will be coming in future free DLC a la Splatoon. The game is creative and great fun and hard to put down once you get the hang of it!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/06/dirt-4-review	"I can't trust IGN anymore, giving these huge scores to every game. I just bought this, what a massive step down from Dirt Rally, physics, graphics.....everything. This feels like a 2008 game. Big waste of money.

When people used to say IGN were getting paid for reviews i used to say not a chance, and back then i believe that to be true. But some of the high reviews the last couple of years, i've bought some utter trash based on these reviews....IGN after 15 odd years of viewing are now obsolete for me, these reviews mean nothing, just keeping the big developers happy to get early content etc..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/06/dirt-4-review	"?? Seriously? 9.2! It doesn't reach the 5/10... I'm a huge fan of any dirt game and mainly Dirt Rally. Being myself into rally I was delighted to see Codemasters releasing Dirt Rally and the very hard work they put into the simulation gameplay. 
However, Dirt 4 looks good on the paper but Codemaster did a complete new game with no respect of the previous version, in terms of tracks (weird countries, randomly generated... boring stuff after few hours playing on it) and mainly on the gameplay.... Even Richard Burns which is a 13 years old game is feeling much better in the car handling! I used to play with the logitech and I'm very disappointed of having bought Dirt 4.
I'm not sure how you guys were able to give this rank to this game, probably you got some friends in Codemasters that paid you for it, but honestly I wouldn't recommend to buy this Sh***t game for the reason that Codemasters but keep the old gameplay updated rather than going on a new floppy one. 
A huge disappointment on my side, even WRC6 will be better in the futur than Dirt 4. I have big hope that the next one will be based on the Dirt Rally version. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/06/dirt-4-review	"Ya dude. Can confirm the graphics are not the strongest with this game. But that's like for the bright sunny stages. As soon as you start playing in more atmospheric conditions at night, dawn, slight drizzle, fog, it can feels very realistic. The cars look great too.
Also... who the fuck can focus on a tree when blazing down a track at 140mph? I think that's the primary reason they let the texture quality slide."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/06/dirt-4-review	I was thinking the same. The game looks meh. I bet it feels great to play. You have to take a racer for a spin to get a true take. We know this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/06/dirt-4-review	I sort of like Dirt 4, it has many things going for it, but after the sublime Dirt Rally it just felt like a step back out on the stages. I did try to give it a fair shout, but overall it just didn't click. I eventually gave my copy to a friend (who struggled with Dirt Rally's punishing difficulty) and he was very happy with the game.

With a decent setup.. these are more immersive. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	"From what I've seen of this it looks like a quickly slapped together game that takes advantage of the fact that Trekkies want a VR Star Trek experience. 
If it was a €10-€15 game it wouldn't be so bad, but it looks like the price tag is there because it's Star Trek. If, as suggested here, you're stuck on the bridge it's a ripoff alright, shameful. 
For €50 there should be multiple ships, shuttles, space walks and you should be able to explore the whole ship. Seems like something you'd only play once or twice.. a demo game basically.
Of course I haven't played it so it might be great, but even if it is, it could be so much better."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	If you're thinking about buying this game and concerned about some of the negative reviews, go read the user reviews on Steam. As someone who's been enjoying the game a great deal since launch, I can say they better reflect my experience with the game than any of the mainstream gaming reviews, many which don't give you any idea just how powerful the immersion of VR can be for an experience like this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	 I think they are far too focused on gameplay mechanics on this one.  The appeal of this game is based soley on the interactions with other people.  This game is insanely fun.  I think if they made it much more complicated it would be difficult for a lot of people to get into.  Considering you are having to work with 4 people it isn't overly easy.  Expansions or DLC can add a lot of variety once everyone has gotten used to the game.  Hopefully one day you can beam your away team down to a planet.  Captain is the brawler, Tactical has the phaser, Engineering has the tricorder.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	"@generalnotsew1976  In all honesty the ""interaction"" aspect is focused on way too much by other reviews, and it's refreshing to have a review that instead focuses on the mechanical side of it that is certainly lacking. 

That ""social interaction"" that is praised so highly frankly dies after a certain amount of hours. A constant issue with VR titles currently is that they have amazing first impressions and initial gameplay but tend to fall flat once you've exhausted it. Interaction with other people in Bridge Crew is fun and a major focus, but it doesn't magically make up for a lack of content diversity and depth once you've mastered each position. 

The game really needs an ""Advanced Mode"" for experienced players that throws in directional shields, separate weapon banks, away missions and dialogue trees etc. Should the game recieve further DLC in the way of new bridges (TNG plz) and mission types I think it can make up for a lot of its flaws, but I'm not entirely convinced it's going to receive any attention from the developer post-release."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	"Well I'm over 20 hours in and it hasn't ""died"" for me. If you check out the steam reviews you'll find many more who are 20+ hours in and still having a blast."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	"I'm not a huge Trek fan. I've watched some of the shows namely OST, TNG, and Voyager as well as the movies but by no means am I a die hard fan. That being said, I've had so much fun playing this game. I honestly cannot remember the last time I've enjoyed a game this much.

AND... I do not disagree with a majority that the reviewer said. Yes, after awhile you've seen it all in this game. The ongoing voyages randomize but it is definitely familiar if you've put time into the game. I love his idea of having mini games at the various stations... I really hope they implement something like this. I'd love to see more alien races. I'd like the captain to be able to add more to engagements such as coordinating NPC help. These are all things they could implement or add and I'm curious to see what they do.

What is missed in this review is the interaction when you are playing with others in multiplayer. Yes, the content can be similar, but when you have vastly different people filling the various roles on the ship, your experience is different every time. Sometimes blandly so, but more often than not, extremely entertaining. Like a lot of VR multiplayer titles, when you visually see someone sitting across from you and are interacting with them like they are in the same room, it adds...something hard to define unless you've played VR and experienced it. Maybe that feeling is  unique to myself (though I doubt it). There is nothing like surviving a harrowing encounter in this game... afterwards you really do feel like you accomplished something as part of a crew. It's great. Solid 8 for me with this game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	@Saediss  Yeah they definitely dropped the ball on talking about what makes this game so great.  I feel like this reviewer was just going through the motions.  I wonder if they spent hardly anytime in multiplayer.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	6.8? Really IGN? I own this, and this one of the most definitive VR experiences I have played so far. It is extremely immersive and engaging, and there is plenty to do. This score is borderline misleading, and some of your comments lead me to question the thoroughness of your time with the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	This game is fun and I do hope that more DLC are coming. This is out of  topic but it is such a bummer that a game like Ace Combat isn't fully VR compatible like RE7. It would have been the perfect game for VR. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	Overall what ever platform you play on it is a well built game, all though I see few short falls.  Missed on missions that involve teleport, we did get to teleport off but not on why can't we beam security over to attempt to subdue or sabotage. Now with in that Why not have a 1st person VR Shooter member on standby to do security missions.  Of course the Crew Vs Crew missions would be so wonderful, of course.  A science station would have been nice so we could counter intrusions and maybe boost our own intrusion attacks, not to mention another station that was integral for the Star Trek universe.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/star-trek-bridge-crew-review	"I've been playing this game since release and sure I already know how many mission types there are. I agree that this game needs to expand its content to keep the community coming for more. 
But I've been playing Star Trek Bridge Crew for far more hours then many other VR games I own. So value wise this game has provided more gameplay time and fun than most VR games I've played.

Keep in mind the premise of this game. 
This is true to the Star Trek bridge experience. Gameplay and immersion wise they delivered on the promise and that alone is worth buying the game.
IF you love Star Trek, if you want to feel like a member of a starship crew, this game is for you. 
There are many things they can do going forward, but you get right now will give you at least 10-20+ hours of gameplay. That is a lot more than so many games we play.
To give you some evidence regarding the value of the game.
I'm reading Steam reviews and check this out:
Here is a player that is giving a not recommended review of Bridge Crew yet he has clocked 33 hours of game time .Come on? I don't invest 30 hours on games I don't enjoy :

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/danger-zone-review	this game is addictive on a scale of 10.  there are some dedicated players already owning the leaderboards.  trash it ant.  the courses get more and more difficult and im currently the 2nd best in the world on 8 courses and you can actually see how many attempts people are making to beat your score which is pretty rewarding.  for the small amount of money you get 20 courses but im having a good time with the first 8.  the game is only £8.99 which is cheaper than a large pizza at dominos.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/danger-zone-review	Or take your troll face out and get it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/danger-zone-review	This game is less fun, because you can't activate the crashbreaker multiple times (after a certain amount of crashes past your initial one earned) for max damage. I also think the medal totals even for easier levels are a tad too high. It's a fun game for a little bit of Burnout 3 nostalgia, but ultimately it doesn't measure up to the game that inspired it. It really would have been better just to release a Burnout 3 (or revenge of Paradise) remaster. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/danger-zone-review	"You CAN collect the crash breaker icons and activate them ANY TIME YOU WANT. Play the game a bit more and learn what you are doing wrong.
And licensing issues make ""BO3 remaster"" impossible. That's why this team left from EA's tyrannical, money grubbing dictatorship and made this on their own. Good on them."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/06/01/danger-zone-review	@Anguawolf Dude... You okay? You've got snarky replies in all these comments. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	"Dont buy this game. Its unplayable.
1. Online is crap as hell, even after patch, you cannot connect, waiting few times more than playing to find an opponent (disconnecting and lost connection - typical issues). 
2. Even when you find opponent, there is 1/3 chance you will lag, sometimes you will have 4-5 games in a row that you will have heavy lags. You can easily lose to someone spamming one combination, and there is no fun even if you win, since no skill is involved.
3. Game has horrible code, it is loading all the time. Character screen? I need to load it. Choosing which side of the screen you want? I need to load it? Finding opponent? I need to load it? Accepting rematch with same opponent and map? I need to load it. For a game with so little textures and objects, this shit is constantly loading - you get old in this game, waiting for anything to happen.
Bottom line, if you are a billionaire who burns money and just want to waste time by waiting for something to load and then lag to death... still dont buy it, donate to charity. It is the only online game I play that has so many, basic problems. It is as if Harada and his team, spend this 3 years on designing hats and tshirts for characters (which are still ugly ) instead of making online works, online which is the only thing making this game worth any penny. Its a waste of time and money, run, switch franschise, as clearly there is no future in Tekken. If in 2017 they cannot figurate out online gameplay, then really something is wrong with dev team."

I know there has been other news worthy of that first link.  Please put something else.  Are you being paid by the developers to keep it in that spot for a certain number of months?  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	its ok though is not the best looking fighter
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@marklola I don't know about that. It looks pretty great on a PS4 Pro and a 4K TV

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@ToinyeWest @Gamer525  The games have gotten much sharper, and are some of the funnest fighting games.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	Ya for sure, well see what happens in the next 2 years.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	 Tekken is my favorite fighting IP and I'm loving this one.   I don't understand how IGN could give this game such a high score.  The online is still severely broken.  Even after the patch.  I've never had such a grave online issue with any game in my history of gaming.  No word yet from Bandai if there's another patch in the works...

it's official. i will buy it when it's 29.99 with gamers unlocked "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	This is the greatest fighting game that i have ever played in my life. That is all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	don't agree with this review. i'd score it lower because i thought the graphics are pretty weak for this gen, lei wulong isn't there (probably DLC later on) and the story is awful. maybe 7.5-8 for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@dr_dohh Woah! you can't possibly give this game a 7.5-8. It has to be more like 8.5-9. Lei Wulong was one of my top five characters so I understand your frustration there. But come on, every story in fighting games suck. I agree that it isn't the best graphics this generation has to offer, however pretty graphics was sacrificed for incredible gameplay and an insane amount of content, besides it really doesn't look that bad. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@SmokeyNinja45 @dr_dohh i think tekken 6 is much better. not sure what content you mean, but i'm not a fan of all the costumes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@dr_dohh @SmokeyNinja45 come on, bro. You can give this game at least an 8.5
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@SmokeyNinja45 @dr_dohh  yeah I don't know how you can get rid of Lei but put in Gigas and not feel weird about your decision?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	not sure you want to hear this a month laterbut this game is growing on me. 8.5 then!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@dr_dohh Yeah, it's a really good game. I've always been a huge tekken fan so maybe I'm a little biased, but I think 8.5 is a fair score to give. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	"@dr_dohh I feel like fighting games WITH actual stories that aren't completely insane, are the exception to the rule. I need completely nonsensical backstories and fighter motivations please. A long standing tradition. 

#shadowloo"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	"As a fan of Tekken since the first game came out, I really don''t know what to think of this one.
Sure it's a lot nicer looking and while the Rage Arts/Drive add a twist to the general fighting, it doesn't feel much different at all to Tekken 6. What is noticeable is the missing features, from big problems like no more Team battles to little things like not being able to bump up max health to 150% (Is it just me or do fights feel a lot shorter now ?).
Not gonna cry any more over the lack of Lei, Mokujin and Armour King  (but why Roger??!!!). Still the new additions aren't anything special - Kazumi and Akuma are nice but the rest? So so.
Me and the bros normally just do VS battles so the lack of single player stuff hasn't been to much of a downer, but the campaign in this is awful. NetherRealm are way ahead of the pack when it comes to story in fighters.

Overall 8/10. Great Mechanics as always but the overall package feels a little thin."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@Deadstark97 i just gave you a like because you been a fan for so long... pretty impressive
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/31/tekken-7-review	@brokeassgamer @Deadstark97 XD. Comes at a price, though. I've never played a Street Fighter game, and given SFV got a lot of heat for various issues, I won't be trying them out anytime soon. Tekken and MK are my go-to fighters, but I've been playing Tekken for longer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	6.5? Get a grip you unprofessional hack. Did you even finish the game? The only complaint I have about this game is the frames do drop quite a bit and that is a shame since it is one of the most beautiful games I have ever played. Go be a good little boy and give the new COD a 9.2 score and leave the reviewing of real games to people who don't take bribes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	 This game needs to release on Switch already. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	"Just platinumed Rime, stunningly beautiful game and an emotional journey.  Soundtrack in particular was A+. Had to come back to this page and comment on how BS Marty's review is.  Without going into spoiler territory, a bunch of his criticisms about the nature of the level design, importance of the collectibles, and the (according to him) ""open ended"" ending are 100% objectively wrong and would be obvious to anyone that actually finished the game. 

It suspiciously comes across as if he didn't even play through Rime before writing the review and just winged it off the press release sheet, something he seems to have a disturbing tendency of doing in his other reviews (e.g. in his review of Darksiders 2 Deathinitive Edition, he inexplicably claimed the game was 60fps when it was actually 30fps)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	I have used IGN for ratings for at least 10 years now. This is the first and last comment I will make. Giving this game a 6.5 is a damn crime, and it is obviously about the money. The ending is not open ended, it is very clear unless you are an idiot. This game is one of hte most emotional and touching games I have every played, and with NO words. Moving on to Metacritic now for the foreseeable future. Don't waste your time with this site.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	"A score of 6.4 really for being similar to ideas that have been done before? Yet AC and Call of Duty continue to get 8's & 9's..

as always IGN, brilliant."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	"every game has ideas from other games--don't make rime sound like its just rip offs from other games because they all do it--even the almighty halo games got their ideas from other games--

I have played the ps4 version of this game and plan on trying the switch version as well--but on ps4 this game is sweet and beautiful--controls are dead on perfect--camera even though been querky couple times--are pretty dead on as well

this game is a puzzle game--you clear a area the next area entered is a puzzle--enemies at first aren't any--but one stage you encounter a huge bird --it sees you it chases you down--
I just think its silly how people down a game for lack of originality--but noting new has come to gaming in years--even though vr is new way to play games but still same format whether it be first person shooter or platform games--

    I give this a 10 rating I totally enjoying this game and not  disappointed in it at all

 now waiting for switch version see how it plays but doubt it be much difference in other versions except  it costs more"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	I just finished Rime this evening. I totally disagree with the score here. This is the only game I've ever played in many years of video gaming that ever made me cry, so I will remember it for a long time. The graphics and music are spectacular. I found the worlds and puzzles to be clever and original. It wasn't terribly difficult, but that's okay because it kept me wanting to explore. My only gripe was that the character control could have been tighter as I fell off many ledges. I would give it an 8.7 out of 10. If you are looking for something different, unique, and beautiful, give it a try. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	Same here. Not ashamed to admit I almost cried. The music was beautiful too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	80 meta critic score, 73 user.  Pretty similar.  IGN's 6 paragraph review, lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	I was wondering about this game when I first saw the trailer. It looked beautiful but I always wanted to know what you actually do in the game. It reminds me of Windwaker more than anything. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/26/rime-review	6.5? That's ridiculous. I enjoyed this game quite a bit...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/perception-review	i think this game has good ideas but was not done right, am playing this game now on my ps4. little nightmares was great  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/perception-review	This game has a 9/10 average rating on Steam. Don't listen to critics. Listen to fans. I've been playing it on YouTube and I think it's great period one of my greatest fears in horror is stuff you can't see or things that move when you're not looking at them. Fear of the unknown. This game plays on all of that
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/perception-review	@oversoul53 it's pretty obvious that's a lame game

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/perception-review	this game looks weird but fun--isn't that what gaming is all about--learn what to do and not to do as proceed through the game  and then praise outlast and little nightmares to boot where do they get these guys

The game also reminds me of Avatar's Toph character, who is blind and pounds her foot to the ground to see everything around her."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/25/perception-review	been looking forward to this unique game and I'm sooooo disappointed because the idea is awesome
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/farpoint-review	I just got this game, it is great, OK it has some laws. But it is a complete experience of a real FPS. I am really happy with the PSVR despite not yet too many games, however, Kinect for 360 had the adventure and some minors, the XONE kinetic had almost nothing, switch is just worth for the Zelda. PSVR has a great immersion and  is promising a lot more, just need wait.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/farpoint-review	I have a question about the quality of the video. The video looks just like playing any other game outside of PS VR. Is this what the player is actually seeing with the headset on? I ask because my PS VR is incredibly grainy. In some games I can barely make out what's in the distance. I certainly do not see my games as the video above. Am I supposed to see lower quality visuals through the headset? I contacted PlayStation support and asked them about this - no help at all. So frustrating. I have calibrated the hell out of this thing as well. It still looks grainy/screen door effect.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/farpoint-review	@Cybertronian the PSVR is 1080P for both eyes. Now imagine you have a way to zoom in against your 1080p screen further, you would see the pixels sometimes because you re too close to the screen and flaws of the 1080p is shown at this time. Now when i played this game, it was totally fine because the devs used rendering to not cause any feeling of blurriness. RE7 did use the rendering as well but not to the extent of Far Point since it was in a house and in a less open area than far point. So what you might see on TV seems to be great quality but up close with a magnifying glass you would notice the blurriness and that s up to the devs to make it more or less blurry  depending on the framerate is been proccessed. You re not suppose to have this normally but devs are brand new to this tech so expect to not see any perfect games until the next gen of VR.  This game for me got it right but could have more improvement but so far it has been the best game on psvr 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/farpoint-review	I'm up to the point you meet the girl. I wonder if he's going to hit that. Would be weird if so.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/farpoint-review	As a psvr owner I have to say this is the game that you want to sit your family and friends down with to get the experience the psvr Aim is the best light gun I have ever used. the story is predictable but who cares about story when the gameplay is this good the only thing I haven't tried yet is the 2 player.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/17/farpoint-review	" This review is totally on point - but let me just say that, there are times, I had an ""out of body"" feeling with how good the VR feels during some of the gunplay... 

Very good game, loving it and while it still is a 7.5, it is a fking blast to play!  This is the start of VR games actually feeling comfortable to play, I cannot wait to go back in to this game when I get home. 

Also the AIM controller is AMAZING.  "

In my opinion Injustice 2 is an amazing fighting game that keeps me entertained with the different multiverse events that would appear and change daily to keep things exciting. The vast customization options, and the satisfaction I would get after reaching level 20 with favorite my character and wanting to with other fav characters."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/16/injustice-2-review	they need to release more fighting levels. i get tired of seeing the same environments . you would think a fighting game would have as much content as possible 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/16/injustice-2-review	@brokeassgamer Exactly!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/16/injustice-2-review	"Ok, I bought the game yesterday, immediately after seeing WW. I jumped straight into the ""To End All Wars"" Multiverse event in order to obtain her film gear. As far as I know the event ends tomorrow, so I leveled her up all the way to level 20 while playing versus with my gf (fastest way to level up) before jumping into Multiverse.

However, even on max level, I stuck at one fight in one of the events (Supergirl fight). Since I am very short on time today, I decided to put WW in AI mode in order to complete the event.

My question is: Do I still get all the film gear by completing the whole thing in AI mode? I noticed that she wins every time against any opponent that way. Isn't this a bit of a... cheating, however? What is the catch?

I really want to obtain all the film gear, but I fear I might have messed something up by putting her into AI mode and basically go... the easy way. At the same time I am running short on time and can't attempt certain fights numerous times, hence why going AI mode."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/16/injustice-2-review	@venom0706 No you still get all of the gear from completion bonuses. By using the AI it lessens your chance of getting the extra motherboxes from each event, but it's not too much of a loss. I use the AI for fights that I am not good enough to do, and I think that is what it is there for, so players who aren't as good or don't have the time can still enjoy most of the same benefits

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	I'm thinking about getting this... looks cool. just watched some videos... although I'm not in the mood to play another really hard game. how difficult is it?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	Lol r u serious? This is a dark souls rip off....if its.bot hard it's pointless. Its very hard but not annoyingly so except a few bosses.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	Level design and the lack of any clues about where you're supposed to go ruined the game for me. Loved the gameplay and combat system but spending way too many hours completely lost in huge labyrinths took all the fun away. A shame, really.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	@SulphuricSaliva that's how i felt about Nier. the getting lost part at least
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	Well hell, twice in a row the game wouldn't allow me to pick up quite moderate sums of tech after I died, that just can't happen. I need to cool off, right pissed. Try again tomorrow, if it does it again, I'm just sending it back (Gamefly).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	Only thing really bothering me about the game is that you can't sneak up on enemies, even if you get directly behind them without being seen or heard, the second you swing they automatically know you're attacking. Really bothersome when you get an enemy who's so quick, they instantly turn around and hit you before your shot even lands, even though they had no idea you were there.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	Not true. You can do stealth hits. He kicks them down, and hits with a heavy swing doing about 1/2 health with one hit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	@nailzDonkey Most times I get that is in the middle of combat, wasn't working consistently at all with stealth. You can walk up behind them, stand there, perfectly still, they still have no idea you're there, and when you swing they instantly know, it's a design flaw. No reason for them to be able to react that quickly to something they have no idea is coming.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	I haven't worked out the sweet spot yet, in terms of distance. But, I've done it more than a few times.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	I love dark souls and finished all of them more than once, I wasn't particularly impressed with the surge gameplay videos but after I played it for myself I completly changed my mind. The gameplay is awesome, challenging and addictive, just wish there'd be more variety with enemy types. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	"I'd love to try a demo but cannot justify putting out for a game i believe i'll regret buying after a few hours of play when i start yearning to play Dark Souls or Bloodborne instead.

just more ""wow, that's cool"" (visual, boss or architecture) moments are needed in any successor (even if some of the light / colour effects are cool in dark passageways) ..., and maybe add some demons, aliens, etc. enemies, besides the mechs & co., it so far hat to offer
..
(it's gameplay is better than Lords of the Fallen, but it's artistic visuals and designs are not.., otherwise it's fun to dig into a less frustrating than DS...)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	"@RaiTheNoblesse Eh? Did u play the game? All the upgrades are just +armor or +damage. All the weapons are effectively reskins with minor changes to stats as they all have the same moveset and the armor is equally as bland. I actually don't think I changed armor/weapon after the first level as there was just no reason to.

Also the notion that you imply DS/BB doesn't have ""nice gameplay"" when they are generally renowned for there exceptional gameplay is rediculous... This game on the other hand is a step up from lords of the fallen but still quite clunky & frustrating with the difficulty curve all over the place. Also, the fact that you fight the same enemies at the end of the game as the ones you first at the start just with more health/damage.... It's not bad, but this game is highly repetetive and bland from enviroment to gear and enemies and with only 5 bosses fights two of which were effectively standard enemies including the final bloody boss! That was laughable."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/15/the-surge-review	"what are you talking about only armor and damage upgrades? you get to chose, if you want use the drone as melee or ranged (melee is good to ""weave in"" midst during fights, when you charged it enough, .. the ranged drone is good for baiting enemies),
you get limited upgrade slots, you can use depending on your play style, .. like go full health or stamina (or core consumption for combos/ finisher, thar needs to be charged),.. or a balance of those., or go health regeneration.. or full damage out put, that uses the ""charger"" , either in ""raw power"" or in ""faster/earlier finisher"" moves (in which case you might want invest in core consumption.., which you can handle upgrade in different ways too) etc. etc..
it's way more interesting than just ugrading 'stats' like in DS.., and ofc besides those, you can upgrade weapons and armors in the surge too..
and haven't even unlocked all upgrade possibles yet..., at least one big like the drone still missing..
and it's like IGN mentioned, the inventory/items (upgrades) are very customizable... which is a motivating part of the gamplay"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	One of the best games of the year so far in my opinion, love it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	Finally played the game, I loved it, the story is very cool and kept interested to the end, there was some annoying stuff like how i didn't know where to go half of time, overall great game worth playing i would score it between 8 and 8.5 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	this game is all about the atmosphere,  and as such it's brilliant.full of jump scares and a constantly engaging story that keeps revealing interesting characters at a constant clip.  but as a shooter or an rog or even an adventure game it lacks the pace and the upgrade system that would make it special.  8.0 is a pretty accurate score considering that it's a lot of fun fun despite is many shortcomings,  not least of which are the horrendously long and immersion breaking load times between areas.  This becomes particularly annoying towards the end when you have to rapidly move between areas and you end up spending 10 seconds moving your character from one for to the next only to wait a good 2 minutes or so for the next area to load. The gunplay is more annoying than fun and the upgrade system starts of as interesting but becomes less so with every additional level un locked. Still, is a memorable experience and definitely worth going through.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	"So this game was initially given a 4.0 because of performance issues. Fair enough.
Now the game has been given an 8.0 because those performance issues have been fixed. Again, fair enough.
And that 8.0 is for PC/Xbox/Ps4. Yet the performance of the game on each of those platforms is totally different. In fact the performance takes a step backwards on the Ps4 due to the latest patch that prompted the re-review.
Is it really so hard to get some consistency with these reviews?
Are performance and technical issues reflected in the scores or not?
Do games get a re-review with every patch or not? If so, which games get a redo and which do not?
Does IGN really test a game across all systems or just assume one version of a game is the same as the others?"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	Well into 20 hours and I can't put this down. Bought it day 1 on PC as well without hiccups.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	I personally think the game is amazing. I'm sure it is a 4.0 on gaystation but easily an 8 on xbox. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	@xratedronnie  lol, out of curiosity, how the fuck is this any better on Xbox? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	@Mr_Magooo @xratedronnie  Unless the Sony versions have been patched it suffers from unresponsive controls and jutter. Digital Foundry did a nice work up on the Sony versions and it wasn't pretty.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	@xratedronnie @Mr_Magooo  Hmmm interesting, I'm pretty sure it was just the demo that was unresponsive and jittery. I'm not sure though, I didn't have any issues on mine, I was just wondering because I have both consoles. Generally I buy cross platforms on my ps4 because they perform better, was gonna be pissed if it was somehow amazing on xbox. Maybe I just got lucky on my playthrough though.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	Lol what type of goon spent 40 hours in this game. I spent 15 and did all side missions and the main quest even on ur 2nd or 3rd play-through can be beat in as little as one hour. If you play this game on console about 20 percent of your total time spent is in loading screens. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	@Toastyproskater  Please prove with a, 15 hour video, not using hacks, how you can play the game through to the end with completing all side missions? The game has a file that is saved showing stats, btw. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	This game on console is a loading simulator with some fun game-play and an incredibly short main quest.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	"Why is this not being adjusted to ''unplayable mess'' on the PS4 ? . At least Digitial Foundry has torn Bethesda apart in the analysis of 1.4 patch on PS4 and PRO.

Obviously yet more patches not tested in house and thrown out to the consumer without a care in the world.

Thre is no way in hell they could miss either the severe stuttering and screen tearing or the fact there is a UI bug now in all console versions.

Sony and Microsoft need to step up to the plate and condemn Arkane and refuse to support their games anymore.

This should now be a mandatory recall on console versions until the issue is resolved.
They even managed to break the decent XBOX one version as far as Fov until a new area is loaded in if you use the UI at any time and go back out of it.

In any case this is one of the most accurate and scathing reports Digital Foundry has done in a while."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/13/prey-review-2	@Deviltaz I think it's going a little far to condemn them, there are plenty of games that have performed just as badly on consoles before. I probably can't say much about what the average gamer expects in terms of FPS, as I often play games at 20 FPS or less, because I play on a shitty laptop. But, I'm used to it, and still enjoy the games. I enjoyed playing through Deus Ex: Mankind at 800x600 resolution and it was still so slow I could see black areas where it was still rendering. I think that while performance certainly matters, and that they should definitely put more work into fixing up console versions, a game can still be enjoyed if it's stuttery

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	I like Forza Horizon but it's not the best racing series. The first two Grand Turismos were the best racing games of all time for me. They were ahead of their time and set the standard. I ve played 3 Horizon's and they're all similar. It's nice to see them change direction. So I ll give this a go.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@fartysweatpantsgamer @G0tHiCm3rCy  how does that even begin to make sense? He likes forza better. People have differing opinions about how much they like video games. It doesn't need an explanation. When a game comes out has no bearing whatsoever on how how good a game currently is, correct?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@thepenismightier @fartysweatpantsgamer @G0tHiCm3rCy incorrect. It definetely matters.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@thepenismightier @fartysweatpantsgamer @G0tHiCm3rCy Sony is big on remakes lately perhaps?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@G0tHiCm3rCy @fartysweatpantsgamer I agree.  There will be nothing like GT 1 and 2 for the original Playstation.  Even current versions of GT aren't as good.  However, Forza Horizon 3 is pretty impressive.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	"Lets just ignore how all the GT games since then have been a huge let down and pretend they never happened.
GT was king... but not anymore...  it can't retain the crown when there hasn't been a decent entry in the series since the PS2."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@fartysweatpantsgamer I've played a couple of Gran Turismo's and they're good. I've played a few Forza's as well and they're better. However, I liked Project Gotham Racing PGR3 the best of the simulation lot.

I don't see one freaking difference between the 1070 PC (core i7 skylake, 16GB DDR4 2100MHz, 512GB SSD etc.) which was $1500+ and the console ($300). 

Visually they're nearly indistinguishable tbh.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@fanirama @BigBacon87 no difference. lol. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@ryqar @BigBacon87 Buy whatever you think you'll use. I have a dual 1080ti and still use my xbox and ps4 way more. The couch is just so much more comfy plus I've been staring at a pc all day.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@ryqar @fanirama @BigBacon87  Do a blind test and when you fail to determine whether it's a console or PC with GTX 1070 powering it, I will lol at you. Again and again. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@fanirama @ryqar @BigBacon87  The framerate on the one is vomit inducing, it's quite easy to tell. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@justsaymrouse @ryqar @BigBacon87  I doubt you have a decent pc at all. But yes, a comfy couch should determine which gaming console is better. Because there is no way to play games on the tv that is in front of the couch. It's just not possible. Only a console can do that. Yawn. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	Easily one of the best DLC packages I have purchased to date. I put it right up there with Lair of the Shadow Broker for Mass Effect 2. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	Not getting caught again , they always end up knocking 50% off the price of these expansions  before too long so best to wait. Either that or they need to stop this nonsense and just release a proper season pass that includes cars and tracks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@deviltaz33 They do have a season pass. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@deviltaz33 Expansion pass. Ahem.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	I love upgrading something ridiculous like the ford econovan to S1 and racing it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	This game is freaking addicting! Love it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	I can't help but think everything the human civilization has done up to this point, all the innovation and hard work was to bring us this achievement, Forza H3: Hot Wheels!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@thundermountain monster trucks next maybe?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	Honest question, have recent patches truly fixed the PC performance? Because I've been holding out on buying until it's running smoothly.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@N0Sdog  I have a heavy gaming pc and Forza Horizon 3 still crashes all the time. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	@N0Sdog Never had an issue with It on PC. I run it with a 1070 and i5 6600k, so while not exactly underpowered, I'm not on the cutting edge of PC performance either. I lock frames at 60 (all other settings on high) and it never dips. Also have it installed to an SSD, I wonder if that makes the difference?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	Very fun add on, quite challenging in parts also (surprisingly)!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/12/forza-horizon-3-hot-wheels-review	I was quite a fan of the original Hot Wheels game on the PSX. It handled so incredibly bad, but it was the first game I know of which implemented the tricks equal boost and that was a huge rush. It's a shame they haven't done the same with this one, plus I'm disappointed the barriers are a bit softcore, though I'm sure the handling is brilliant this time around.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	I really like this game.. but it sure whet the appetite for NBA Hangtime to be released for switch!  PS WTF is the update.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	"Just bought this on Switch. It's super laggy in the menus and it looks very bad in handheld mode. It looks pretty good in console mode though.
The computer is pretty cheap and shot timing is weird. The AI beat me 8-30 in my tutorial match. That was fun.
Also the Switch version had some weird controller vibration issues. It vibrates at absolute max, so loudly that it legitimately sounds like a car horn.
Maybe look into other versions, but absolutely do not buy it on Switch.
If you're looking for NBA Jam, this isn't it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	The game isn't too bad. Its not as deep as I would like, basically just pass in bounds to my guy running up the court and have him shot a 3 and repeat. But there is some strategy to completing each gold cup challenge and playing co-op and versus is fun.I'd say its worth the money but more content needs to be added. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	For $20 it's not bad. It's no NBA Jam or Hangtime that's for sure. Even compared to those games it's very one dimensional.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	@Breezer23 You get what you pay for.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	NBA Jam was way funner than this game, the computer hardly lets you dunk it. And there is no shooting shots at the buzzer which is totally lame sauce.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	Complete waste of money, your skills won't get you anywhere. This game is nothing but unfair. Seriously don't buy this game thinking it's NBA jam. It is nothing like it. It's the worst basketball game I've played.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	It's literally the same engine and gameplay from the previous NBA Jam game. So I really don't get the complaints
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	Played it for half an hour, hated it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	"I cant make a shot on the Switch version. Ive tried and tried to make a 3pt and its just brick after brick. I gave up after Ray Allen went 1 for 13. I tried all different release points. 
I shoot air balls, my layups never go in , and I cant dunk for shit. The timing is HORRIBLE. I honestly want my money back."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	@bluegrass1014 The timing is horrible on Xbox One, PS4, and PC as well. Goes to show why a meter is a must-have in basketball games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	I make a lot of Them with good three shooters. Gotta release at the highest point of the jump when you are open. I make more then half every game. Just gotta get used to it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	" Oh man, NBA Street. 

Just re-release that game with updated graphics. Win."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	 Man I just got this and its difficult to dunk. I must be doing something wrong. Any tips? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	@iscmarkiemark  Time it just like you would time a shot. Let go of the button when you hit the peak of your jump, don't hold it all the way to the rim.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/09/nba-playgrounds-review	@iscmarkiemark I struggled with that too. A meter would really help with timing everything.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	Fella's - recent fixes make this a 9!!! I kid you not, it's ACE :) 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	Did they patch this game yet?? I wasnt going to buy this till they did. I heard the biggest problem was the long load times. Is that fixed?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	After only discovering this game a week ago I read the reviews and was disappointed that a potentially great sniper game failed due mostly to technical issues at launch. I like Sniper Elite so I searched to see if a patch was put out. I discovered that a massive 10 gig patch had been put out to fix most if not all of the things people were complaining about. I took a chance and got it. Now I cannot put it down. It's awesome. Graphics are great, no bugs encountered after 5 hours of playing. The sniping mechanics are far superior to Sniper Elite.And the slo-mo bullet cam kills are incredibly realistic (not that cartoon-ish X-ray stuff of Sniper Elite). No, here you have to use skill with several different styles of rifles and scopes to place the perfect shot with slo-mo reward, and when you do, it's indescribably satisfying to see the blood splash out of ears, eyes, ass or wherever. No X-ray crap. It looks and sounds real. with blood splatter staining the walls/floor as well.Missions are terrific and varied.I'm immersed in the story line, The only mechanic I don't love is the driving, which is pretty basic, but aside from that I feel this game should get a new review based on the bugs being fixed---and I'd give it a solid 9.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	@Shoegazer1 100%!!!! NEEDS new review!! This game has been fixed and is incredible... I promise you this is absolutely a 9!! Thanks
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	When are they going to give up with this series? Not a good title among them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	"with all my respect to Aurelia Shrenker, ""Georgian songs""texts are a bit ""rough"" like someone used google translate for them, it would be more adequate if creators used native speakers skills for that. also, the Georgian inscriptions in game are mistaken totally, there are not  such words or local names, toponyms or such ""words architecture"" at all :) it would never take any money to ask for such help from native Georgians, there are plenty enthusiasts, thats why i wonder...."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	Well... bargain bin it is.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	"Well it didn't get any ""Snipe"" than this."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	Um, sorry I'm not a fan of Naomi as the narrator, her voice just doesn't match the style of writing and there doesn't seem to be much emotion vocally.  I dunno, I had a harder time listening than watching.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/27/sniper-ghost-warrior-3-review	 yea right, like the LACK OF MP will kill this game.  Even if MP was there, it will be deserted after week 1. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	"1. I hate short games.
2. I hate no replay value.
3. I don't care for the majority of ""indie"" games.
4. I LOVE this ""game.""

This is one of the most phenomenal pieces of art I have enjoyed in a long, long time. The discovery in this game is top notch, along with the stories surrounding each character.

I purchased this game for $20 on Steam and it literally took me only 2 hours to complete. Normally, I would be frothing at the mouth and enraged for the previous sentence I just typed. For whatever reason, I was fine with the length and I think it primarily revolves around the deep emotions you quickly attach to many of the family members.

The two that hit me the deepest revolved around a bath tub and a fall out shelter. While I won't go into any more detail than that, each one of those events contained multiple feelings: joy, happiness, sadness, humor, dreaded fear. I could go on and on. This ""game"" could have easily been a book or even a movie, but making it a video game was the correct choice. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	can I play this on a macbook pro? Or is it better on PS4?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	"People talking all this shit about consoles need to go look at some Horizon or Forza footage.
Games can run well and look great on both consoles if optimized correctly.
Blame the devs for this one guys, there's no excuse why this game is running this poorly on either the base PS4 or the Pro"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	@Intern3st I second that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	"@Intern3st Yeah, right! God forbid there are reviews about such games which, you know, other people (heard about them? Other people? Don't be afraid, but the world is full of them) might enjoy.
Kill it with fire! Let's instead only have reviews of AAA-games by major companies and endless amounts of accompanying articles (""10 things you haven't noticed in Fallout 4!"" ""The first 10 minutes of Andromeda!"" ""Dev comments on how they worked a lot of this new game""), and let's forget indie games, story heavy games, games with a message or whatever. 
Let's instead focus on another cliché sequel to a popular title or, even better, another one of those incredibly creative games with Tom Clancys name in the title. "

You know that most of the world likes variety of things. Only small minded people think that only games like Undertale or Titanfall are great. You fall into dude bro and see everyone who doesn't agree as pretentious. You can like coffee and tea! Did you know that!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	"@LordMolecule
You're making erogenous assumptions.
Being ""new"" or different has nothing to do with why these types of games are usually pretentious.
They're pretentious because the devs are so smugly convinced about their own cleverness.
It's like reading a Neil Gaiman novel. That guy is so far up his own arse that he could perform a visual inspection of his bowels."

Who the hell wants next, next gen when they can't even run indie games at 1080p 30 FPS. Should have waited for Ryzen Sony and MS. You made pointless, unbalanced consoles with CPU's that would have sucked in 2008.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	@IamTheScourge It took them four years (I think) to make and an incredible amount of effort and imagination has clearly gone into it. You'd presumably pay money to see a two hour film, so why is a game any different? That said, I suppose we all have different ideas of value, but there's no valid argument for it being lazy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	Nice comeback! Good point.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/what-remains-of-edith-finch-review	"it is interesting though that IGN are trying to get away with all these lies. Is it deliberate or did they really assume the PS4 version would run as smoothly as PC.? That seems doubtful so something else is going on. Payment or incentive from Publisher to keep quiet about issues seems the most likely. 

Thank goodness for sites like Digital Foundry that tell the truth to us. In any case IGN should be reported as if they continue along this line they don't deserve an operating licence.

 I've reported sites before for lies so i am not going to sit back and let them try and pull the eyes over the public unless they print a retraction and tell the truth that is.

If you have nothing to hide IGN then prove it? It is bad enough when a publisher tries to pull the wool over our eyes and they get called out for it nowadays so you aren't exempt of your behaviour either or should not be."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review	I enjoyed certain parts of the game. But some of the challenges were ripped off from Inside and that makes me not care for the game as much
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review	 I thought the game was okay. The odd perspective really bugged me and the enemy design after The Janitor were just bad. I really didn't like having to platform in 3D with only a 2D perspective. It caused quite a few unnecessary deaths. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/26/little-nightmares-review	 I quite enjoyed this little, dark, weird game, and I like the PS4 theme I got with it too. It is pretty short, gameplay is easy, a few dumb deaths here and there. I love the soundtrack, Prison Toys!

I'm mad."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/25/mr-shifty-review	I enjoyed it. It had some hiccups but that didn't prevent me from having fun and being entertained. It was longer than I though it would be too. I'd like to see what else they could do with a sequel.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/25/mr-shifty-review	If their dumping more neo geo games on switch they need metal slug 2 and X, Mutation nation. Also Konami needs to emulate their arcade collection on there, Simpsons beat em up, X Men arcade and of course ninja turtles and turtles in time would be awesome to have on the go and on tv and they could use 4 players.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/25/mr-shifty-review	I played the beta on PC, it's not very good even with a stable frame rate. Maybe I've been spoiled by Hotline Miami, but the level design was underwhelming and you're not allowed to aim and move in separate directions.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	Surprisingly a great game with enough content to justify the price. If you want a game to be preloaded to play on the go, this is it. Wouldn't recommend the physical copy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	Fantastic game! Help entertain me while I have a bowl movement! Love it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	I love this game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@Nyle_ON It's great!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	so puyo puyo is Dr. Mario?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@urprob No, Dr. Robotnik's Mean Bean Machine.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	" ""The Tetris player is at a slight disadvantage.""

Is that why the top 50 players across the world are almost dominantly Tetris players?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	So it's probably a solid 6.2 in reality. Gotta add that 2.5 extra just because it's Nintendo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@rizzchit  Sure its a 6.2... if you've got no friends to play with that is.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	"@rizzchit  It's sega, not nintendo.

Why would a nintendo only game be on the PS4?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@Technature probably still scored higher just because it is on there
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	"I think this one is more expensive at the store.  It's $40 CDN to download, which is cheaper than I expected.

Needless to say, it is currently downloading."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	"Still over a tenner more for the Switch version.

For Tetris!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@mrs1nister Tetris is a classic. It's like complaining for having to buy another Monopoly board game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	"@BERT0503 @mrs1nister Yeah it is such a classic that i can remember playing it way back in 1988 on my Commodore 64 and i can assure you i paid less than £10 for it brand new. So what does this new version contain that's worth so much more money?.

And your Monopoly comparison is just off, mostly because i wouldn't pay for a digital version of a board game. It completely misses the point.

The fact is its over a tenner more for the Switch version for a Tetris game. Who in their right mind would pay over £20 for Tetris nowadays yet they seem to think you'll plump out £40 for it when the PS4 version is £30."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@mrs1nister @BERT0503 I did not say anything about a digital version of a board game. One of the most recent version of the Monopoly game added a credit card instead of using paper as money in the board game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	 Yeah not worth the $40. I would rather get Street Fighter 2 The Final Challengers over this. I'm getting Mario Kart 8 Deluxe tonight though. :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@residentevilfan09 Too many fun games!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/puyo-puyo-tetris-review	@residentevilfan09  Game is $40 for a physical copy on the switch, or $30 for a PS4 physical copy or Switch download (Switch physical comes with keychains and other neat little things).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	While I'm not sold on these Dynasty-style games, they seem to be improving with each iteration.  If the improvements continue these games might actual be very good one day.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	Not her fault at all (and sorry if you're reading this right now!) but Heidi's voice is annoying as shit! It's like listening to a dull, very old grandmother reminiscing about how things used to be back in her days.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	Should people who really didn't like the first game be allowed to give their opinion on the second game?  IGN really hated Dragon Quest Heroes the first time around.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@GreyLightning Of course they should. It just goes to show the developer has improved with the sequel.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	"""Things like teleporter puzzles and switch puzzles plopped in between fights bring the sense of action and tension to a screeching halt. ... until you finally get a few scraps of the fighting you crave.""

Okay, I suppose some people don't like variety, so that makes...

""the fighting still gets a bit wearisome after a while""

... Wait, what?

(Now, I'm being a bit facetious here - but only a little.)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@arnwyn Makes sense to me. Many of the Dynasty Warrior style games do get tiring due to the repetitive combat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@BERT0503 @arnwyn  not gonna lie while playing the first one I would get tired after sitting there for 10min just fighting wave after wave 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@melee92 @BERT0503 @arnwyn Exactly!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	Thank you Heidi for the review. You made some good points. I will definitely check it out on Switch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	what's a leesure?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	I'm about 2 hours into the game and I think its amazing. I loved the first one and this one is already even better. I give it a 10/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@BrianMeadows  Most games are a blast the first couple of hours. When the new and shiny effect is gone, that's when you can properly rate a game in my opinion. Come back and let us know your rating after many more hours. I'm sincerely curious. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@Dargone @BrianMeadows Well seeing as how this is part 2, and I played all of part 1 and loved it, and this one is already better than part 1 (and I loved every other dragon quest that I've ever played), I think its safe to assume that my 10/10 stands. Now would you like to post another reply, but minus the condescending pretentiousness, sweetheart?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@BrianMeadows @Dargone   Nah, I wasn't being pretentious or condescending. Sorry you felt that way. Hard to get the tone and all of that. I'll definitely take your word that this game is perfect for you and that you need no more time invested to solidify that opinion. As stated, I think it takes more time to rate a game. Just a difference of opinion - no worries.  Glad you are enjoying the game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	"@BrianMeadows @Dargone ""Now would you like to post another reply, but minus the condescending pretentiousness, sweetheart?""

LOL overreaction."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	Meh same as the last one. No open map just open levels. Most which look the same
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	What a pack of $ony whingers...  not that I am surprised... its getting an 82 on Metacritic so the review isn't that far off the mark...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	"Did not enjoy the reviewer. Not got a problem with female reviewers at all infact i like the female IGNs alot. But her voice isnt very clear and it doesnt appeal to me at all. Some comments are complaining about people like me complaining about her but so what if we are. Her voice wasnt good to listen too at all. But the actual review was well written. I think IGN sometimes get someone else to read the review. Maybe do that with her.
Also someone on youtube said she is trans. If she is then cool but doesn't change my opinion."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@Kvothe1988 Yeah, her voice is kinda robotic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	"@Kvothe1988 I have to 100% agree.  I am not sure if she is a contributor or staff but she should stick to writing the reviews and not actually recording them.  I normally never comment on reviews, but this is a game that I feel could break through in the west.  I wouldn't expect IGN to give it a 9 or something but I was fairly surprised at how poor the review was.  

For starters I understand this is a sequel and that this is a type of genre that isn't common like a shooter or 1000 RPG like The Witcher.  But it seems to be getting cut down not for the gameplay on offer but the genre itself.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	Well the genre itself has seen very little innovation since dynasty warriors 2. Each one gets a little better (usually) but at the end of the day, they are all button mashing simulators.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@Kvothe1988 I had no trouble. I enjoyed the video and the review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/24/dragon-quest-heroes-2-review	@Kvothe1988  Shrug. I thought the quality of the review was great. She made great points and backed up every like/dislike with gameplay examples. It would be great if every review was voiced by Sean Bean or James Earl Jones; however, I didn't find her voice grating. YMMV...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	"Since the Switch sucks so bad and has no games, I had to pick this one up used for $18... and honestly, it's the only thing to do with this system as a portable. I think it appears better than the WiiU, but still has many bugs. The auto steer has no intelligence (so make sure to turn it off) and I noticed when throwing a turtle against a round corner, it just bounces directly back to me, which shows the lazy japanese programming that always has no physics. I found the 50cc mode, which I concidered the easy mode, was actually the most hardest.. Every second your constantly being bombarded with attacks, especially if you are in first place. The game cheats alot, but that is what I expect from japanese programmers, as they live to aggravate american children to death. So in closure, if you got tricked into buying the ""Worst System EVER"" Then chances are you have no choice but to buy this game again...."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	So many problems with this score, but the biggest one: MK8 is just a bad Mario Kart with no balancing at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	So its the same game as Wii u but its portable and it gets a 9?  Reviews are skewed by the personal preferences of each reviewer. There should be a criteria for giving a game a good review and Nintendo games should be held to that criteria even if the system is portable for 3 hrs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	@mmmidnight1 It's the highly improved battle mode that gives it a good rating.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	"@mmmidnight1
3 hrs is the MINIMUM, depending on the game, the Switch's battery life will improve. 

It's actually not exactly the same game since the battle mode is significantly better which adds more variety and value to this version, on top of that some changes to the mechanics further improve and set this version apart from the original, hence the higher score. 

""Reviews are skewed by the personal preferences of each reviewer"" that's a rather silly statement since most reviewers review games within their ""personal preference"", you're not going to make someone who only enjoys FPS games review a JRPG, someone who reviews games within their preference would be able to better articulate the pros and cons of the game because they understand the genre, developer and style of the game much better as well as let those who are interested in those types of games if it's fun or not. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	"@mmmidnight1  If you don't like how it is now, how do you propose games get reviewed objectively? It's never been done. You know why? How ""good"" or how ""fun"" a video game is, is largely very subjective. Suck it up, buttercup - it's just the way it is :)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	How come this game does split-screen the wrong way? ie, the way that makes it impossible to see left and right?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	@LangisZERO I struggled with that in the beginning too but got used to it quickly.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	was super hesitant to buy this again on switch since I had it with dlc on wiiu, but I have not regretted it at all.  Been playing tons of races, its great!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	@Zoomcreep Same here. Definitely just as fun the second time around.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	@Zoomcreep  Me too.  The little gameplay changes hooked me again.  Three levels of mini-turbo boost, two items, and 200cc Time Trials are fantastic.

It's like buying The Last of Us Remastered after buying the original on the PS3 already.  Exact same thing.  ""That's not true because the Mario Kart 8 graphics are the same."" Doesn't matter; gameplay upgrades make up for that."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	"@samarz @gotobestbuy  I have this game on the wii u and it looks almost exactly the same. I think they got lazy and this will be a trend with them.  ""Wii u games but portable"""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	@mmmidnight1 @samarz @gotobestbuy Considering how much Wii Us they sold, it's not surprising. They'll try to cash in the Wii U' big games that didn't sell that much
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/20/mario-kart-8-deluxe-review	@gotobestbuy I never pay $60 for a game; video games don't hold any value anymore. I believe back when GameStop was Funcoland, Dragon Ball GT Final Bout was on sale for $120 because it was rare

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	I miss these types of games. Still, I like seeing creative 3D platformers coming back, with games like this, Mario Odessy, and Yooka Laylee.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	If this was a PS4 game it would've gotten a 10 lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	Nintendo* but probably a 9
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	Not really, other than the odd few exclusives, PS4 exclusives generally get around a 7
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	Never played the full game before, but I remember playing the demo back in the day. Steam currently has it at 100% for positive votes. I will pick it up when I make a bigger dent in my backlog. Also Microsoft needs to be more aggressive in advertising their games outside of the big 3 so we can get sequels.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	"@Flashattack3

Yeah I played the demo too back in the day. I remember liking the demo. I just bought this version and it holds up pretty well. The camera is probably the worst part. 

I'm actually impressed by the graphics. The way this game handles reflections is pretty great for a 14 year old game. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	Well they remade the textures in the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	"@Flashattack3

Reflective surfaces are engine bound, not just textures they could update. Of course the reflections look better since they have an increase in resolution. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	I enjoyed this game back on the original Xbox, but I'm curious as to how well the gameplay held up. Surprisingly, I would actually like a Remaster of Blinx The Time Sweeper if we're to start remastering original Xbox games. That was actually a really fun game, and pretty underrated. Also, would love to see a remaster of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath along with Stubbs the Zombie.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	"@LordKri

I think they already remastered Oddworld: Strangers Wrath last generation. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	@Doctor_MG @LordKri You're right, totally forgot they released an HD version of it for the PS3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	 My first game purchase on the original Xbox!  So much charm.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	This and Wonder Boy were pleasant surprises to wake up to.  I may have to see a trailer for this game before I settle on it (man I was so psyched for Tearaway on the PS4 and then it turned out to be kinda...baby-ish, so I'm kind of hesitant now about non-Nintendo styled 3D platformers), but otherwise I'm pretty set on grabbing this for my gaming PC.  The original X-Box had all these neat 3D platformers (Blinx comes to mind) that could have been flagship franchises for the system, but they never made the jump to the X-Box 360.  It's a dear shame.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/voodoo-vince-remastered-review	@jttwister09 Yes you can. Download the game from the Windows 10 store or Steam and connect either an Xbox 360 or Xbox One controller.

I was surprised how much I remembered after 22 years (like the bunnies), but more surprised how bad the last 10 minutes are gameplay-wise, when the finale of the game is reduced to stupid, non-sensical searching through menu options on a computer, twice, under a tight time limit.

In any case, this is worth every penny. Please buy it so maybe we can see a Full Throttle 2 (already cancelled once) or more great remasters/original games from Double Fine :)"

Seems like a no brainer, especially the little kid ones.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	it's funny that they comment how incredibly hard these games are even with a rewind function, playing them as a 8-9 year you just accepted they were hard as balls and went until you beat it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@mantle536 Exactly! In most of these games there was no save or checkpoint. A lot of times my brother and I would leave the console on while we ate lunch or dinner.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	Dude I'm getting the switch soon and I'd love It on that console. Nintendo games make sense on a Nintendo console. But alright, I'll get em on the other ones. Rather have it done than not at all
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	I chose to download this on the xbox over the ps4, solely because the xbox was my newest toy and need to add more games to my xbox collection. But i rally enjoy the games, though i was having trouble at first with swinging scrooges cane in the first duck tales, the music is fun, and it did bring back memories of my childhood. i too like other members wish this would have came out for the switch as i would have preferred to have this game on the go.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@SPRDPRDTS Yeah, talk about a miss opportunity with the Switch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	They need to remake all the good Sega Mega Drive Disney games like Aladdin, The Lion King, Toy Story... The Little Mermaid (yes I know it wasn't great but, I'm a sucker for mermaids so...), just like they remade Castle of Illusion which was great! Oh oh, they should remake some of the PSX ones too: Hercules, Tarzan. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@Melodina Yeah, what happened to those good Disney games? Epic Mickey was almost getting there.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	 once again, they got the wrong guy to review these games. IGN is slacking for real. but i do agree with the people. this collection could have been released on a PS3 or 3DS at least. also i agree with one thing the reviewer said: they should have included the game boy games as unlockables for beating the games. a museum is good but not great. at least throw episodes of the shows on there as an unlockable bonus. mega man collection did it. they threw a mega man episode on there when you beat mega man 8. they dropped the ball there because i am pretty sure they had disney's consent to do this collection as a whole
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@blakcrimson29 Yup!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	Interesting. I have always pronounced it 'cApri sun' rather than 'caprI sun'. I wonder if that is a US/UK difference?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	This should of been released on PS3 Wii U and Xbox to. It's not like you need PC level power to run this game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	Oh fuck off IGN. Darkwing Duck was by FAR the best game of the entire set. Fuck you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	I agree, but your attitude seems immature
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	"Why the heck this isn't released on Switch or even 3DS for that matter? Total missed opportunity...oh wait....VC is coming. 

My question is though, does this package have any filters for modern TVs???"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@kuliddar  Nothing else of note is getting released on Switch why would this be?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@stephen_alex_walker @kuliddar You must not have heard FIFA 18 and Skyrim is coming to Switch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	Dont forget minecraft
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@JollyThad Yup!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@BERT0503 @stephen_alex_walker @kuliddar  Oh a 6 year old game from the last generation which is already available on PS4/XB1 and a football game also available on PS4/XB1 hardly valid reasons to buy a new console. Wouldn't surprise me if they pulled the old Wii trick with FIFA and released a really cut down version of the real game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	@stephen_alex_walker @BERT0503 @kuliddar Did you forget about Super Mario Odyssey, Splatoon 2, Xenoblade Chronicles 2, and Project: Octopath Traveler?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/18/disney-afternoon-collection-review	The only logical explanation why those games are not on the Switch is because those games are going to be on VC. I'm guessing Nintendo did not allow them to release it on the Switch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	The developer recently revealed that The Dragon's Trap sold more copies of Wonder Boy on the Switch than the three other platforms released on combined (PS4, Xbox One, and PC). That's an impressive figure, especially considering Switch only just launched in March and has a much smaller install base than the other platforms. Things are looking good with the release of Monster Boy and the Cursed Kingdom expected later this year on Switch also.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	This game is great. Don't know much about the wonder boy series but damn this game is great to just pick up and play. Very accessible and not intimidating.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	OMG how did I not know about this. One of the best 8-bit games released.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	This game was so awesome when I was a youngin'. Playing it again today in it's remastered form gives me hope for all the other amazing Master System games that came out back then. Zillion, Alex kidd in MW, Zaxon 3D, Rambo, Transbot, Fantasy Zone (even the maze one.), and on and on. This game is awesome, even by todays standards. I give it a 10 for nostalgia purposes and an 8-8.5 by todays standards.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	Amazed at the score, the art and music are 10s. the game is provably a solid 8.... so.... 9 then!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	7.1 Really? This was the best game that was made on The Sega Master system. At the time, it looked amazing graphically and hands down had a much better Art style, music, and more fun to play than Zelda II Adventures of Link on the NES.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	I dunno what this guy is smoking but this looks great
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	"Jon, I think your score is not reflective of the fun and polish of the game.
To be fair, it doesn't seem from your review that you played the original (or that you enjoyed it) which may explain the lack of appreciation for sticking completely with the source material (which I personally truly appreciate no matter how rigid the game can feel).

Also 6-7 hours seems like a really long time and I'm sorry if you've had to grind, but being an average player it only took me 4 and I only died once.
This game is awesome and would benefit from an extra point from you guys IMHO (I would score it a 10 simply because of nostalgia but being pragmatic that's at least a solid 7.5 - 8.5 for Guardian's of the galaxy....)

The only true issue with the game and that I think you guys got wrong is with the physics, every single time my attacks weren't falling I had to go back to retro mode to get through. Meaning things were actually working in the 80's but that fluff over substance today means we're having to compromise in the modern age.

Just my personal feedback, overall though thanks for all the reviews,
Good luck
Nick"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	Grinding for items still increases the playtime in 2017.  Stop complaining.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	 they got the wrong guy to review this game. it's like he never played games before 2000. that's the aesthetic to the game. it is an old game with a new fresh coat of paint. you can't compare it to ori and the blind forest. that's ingrained in new sensibilities. totally incomparable. with this game, you know what you are getting when you come into it. the only problem i have with this game is the price. it should be 10 dollars tops
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	@blakcrimson29 They need to make a living but i do agree $20 is too much. $14.99 would have been the sweet spot for me and is not a bad price either. I'm waiting for the PC version, I'll get that version.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/wonder-boy-the-dragons-trap-review	@AngryBeast @blakcrimson29  yes 14.99 is reasonable. my thing is that this game is for old school gamers (i would love new players to dabble in this game as well so more can be made like this) and i am fine with that. it looks great though. i will get it later on though
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	 If you like TT games and like GotG then you'll like this game. Thoroughly enjoying this myself, so far. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	"I miss the old Telltale. Sam&Max, Monkey Island...waiting this fake ""choices"" trend to be over."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	Funny how others including Gamespot don't think so. I really thought these fake reviews asked for by publishers were done by now but here we go again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	@deviltaz33  Yes, because this person liked the game it CLEARLY proves that. Crawl back in your cave troll. Not everything in this world is a conspiracy. If you like the TT formula and you like GotG then you'll like this game. It's pretty simple. I'm actually playing the game (unlike you) and am thoroughly enjoying it. Go piss in someone else's cereal you negative Nancy. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	I don't want a game review from some fanboy of TT games. Bias only takes away credibility from the reviewer. In a world where games are reviewed without fanboys crying about bad reviews to their special little games, this game gets a 5 at best when you compare it to other games in today's market.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	The thing with these type episodic games is you're usually better off waiting for all episodes to release and getting the 'complete' version for a really good price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	@behaaaave exactly what I say.  while these games are fun and I even enjoyed the Jurassic Park and the Law and Order one, I do wish these episodes were a bit longer than they have been
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	@behaaaave Yep 4.95 in a xmas sale is usually the best price. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	Just played 5 minutes of it on the phone and can't stand it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	@shawn939 Can't believe what they are charging for the season on IOS. You have to be  f'kn kidding. $22.95 Australian. That was probably a better joke than what will be in the game. Ep 1 alone is $7.95. Yet Ep one for most games has been free.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	Would rather watch a movie, demo was ok.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	@bridges7 Even a Starwars story where everyone dies is better value.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	"I was such a Telltale fan back when it was TWD season 1. I couldn't wait to play the next episode.
Since that time, it seems TT had lots of difficulty to step their games in terms of innovation. Almost nothing new was brought in other series and there was barely any graphic evolution.
I keep trying a couple of episodes here and there, but I'm disappointed most of the times. Is GOTG worth it?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	This review was done playing the game on a Playstation 2. No way this was this  designed for 2017.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/17/marvels-guardians-of-the-galaxy-the-telltale-series-episode-1-tangled-up-in-blue-review	@californiasurfboy paid review, Read the Gamespot one , they weren't nearly as impressed. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	"I really think it should have been mentioned that classes don't require to be bough in store. You can craft every class in the game. So even then, you still don't have to pay, and it's still technically ""free"", just means a grind for mats"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	Its very poor that this reviewer was not someone that got involved with a club or even played the game at great length. Whats missing from this review is how social this game is. I have played on the eu server since the start of the beta and im leader of a semi-big club. Ive made many friends on psn through this game. The community of players and the politics/in game economy of the game is one of its biggest draws and what keeps you coming back to it. This review is an improvement on the last but still fails to get what this game is about. But i get why. Its a game that requires dedication and no paid reviewer will have the time for that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	"I played Trove a bunch when it first released on Steam Early Access and I go back to it every now and then.  

I think Trove is great if you play with people and primarily work on building your own club world and being creative. 

If you're just trying to become more powerful, it's shamefully repetitive and boring. ""grindy"" doesn't even begin to describe it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	Might just give it a try.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	Creativerse is much better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	@Cavemantero HAHAHAHA!!!  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	@Cavemantero  Creativerse is a very fun game but it does not belong in a comparison with Trove, as they are very different from each other. Both are fun games but for their own reasons and Trove should not be compared to a game like Creativerse.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	"We getting a Starblood Arena review? I'm pretty sure other VR owners are looking for a venue to check reviews for VR games. But we are getting reviews for Trove lol
Guess we'll look elsewhere."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	FUN FACT:  IGN regulates bad reviews because they are worried about losing ad revenue.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	@Fellnorn Fun Fact: Proof of that anywhere?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	http://au.ign.com/videos/2017/03/22/trove-review-ign-ap
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	Well this is interesting. Anybody have a link to a cached copy?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/11/trove-review	 It was fun for a little while.  Then they expect you to grind gem fragments at an alarmingly slow rate based on the cost to level gems.  That's the only way to gain power (PR) and do damage or survive.  It gets boring really fast.  You can P2W, but their RNG is abyssmal.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	As a reminder, Jose originally scored Splatoon a 7.9. That's right...lower than this game. I know...sad. But in an IGN first he had to re-review and give it a higher score because reasons. This looks good too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	Here we go.. there will be a mile high pile of games like this for Nintendo as they drive the switch into irrelevance . The switch will NOT sell 15million units in its life cycle . it may do better than wiiu due to a more coherent launch , but that hype is already dying off, and by the time Mario is released at christmas, nobody will care about the switch anymore
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	This game is so fun and simplistic yet beautiful, vibrant, and addictive. I have not had this much fun with a shooter since Resogun. For $13, it's well worth it...Especially when I can play it in the bathtub because why wouldn't I? 👍
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	I wish this was on the 3ds.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	 another indie machine

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	Have you tried it? ...Because you seem to know what you're talking about. And by that I mean you don't know shit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	 Definitely a great game for anyone who enjoyed Resogun. Trying to get a good grade on just even the second world levels is extremely challenging. Really happy with this purchase!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	 I need to pick this up!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	Another great Zelda diversion, I really look forward to bathing now I have a Nintendo Switch!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	 Weird for me, but this game in handheld mode makes me motion sick. Love the game, though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	@JOem316 watching the review video made me motion sick. It looks good but I'm not sure I could actually play it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/10/graceful-explosion-machine-review	The gameplay looks so satisfying. Looks like I'll have to play this before Wonder Boy next week.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	THIS GAME IS FUN period. The amount of creativity, art and comedy put into this is amazing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	"I downloaded this game because I saw someone talk about upcoming releases, I was like ""Huh, that looks interesting, Kinda like MadWorld and Quake... I'll try it"" I played it and already in the tutorial it felt annoying and over the top trying to be funny, kinda like what happened with Destiny. But the gameplay is obnoxious but very easy, As soon as you are on someone they are probably going to die if you are willing to chase them for 4 minutes. and other players have no idea how to utilize abilities, I was just killing players. and everytime I died the game would say the same Dialogue over and over and over. It's a cool looking game, but not a good one by any means. If the game had compelling combat it'd be more fun, and keep in mind, this is a FREE game so if you would like to see it for yourself, go ahead and try it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	Drawn to Death's major hiccup was it's game play. If you're a snowflake who get offended easily I suggest a different game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	its one of the better games that they usualy crap out every month.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	The gameplay is boring. It is by far the biggest problem of this game imo. The reviewer is overreacting on the insults thing...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	"This game is fun and worth the download. Its FREE right now so try it out.  I've played about 15 hours and have yet to experience any of the issues listed in the video and the humor in it is actually funny. It almost seems as if the reviewer took the insults personally xD.  Didn't mention any of the character specific abilities they do where the real damage comes from also...  

Try it and make up your own mind."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	To all the people saying it was scored low due to language and offensive humor that's b.s. For a free game I'd say it's a 5 or 6 but if i paid 15+ dollars for this I'd give it a 3. Not even worth the download imo. Fun for about 30 minutes but there's no real depth or reason to keep playing. The one liners get old fast and the humor isn't really funny, even for people with dark humor like myself.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	What a Tear off for this Game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	Maybe Drawn To Death Creators should rub it out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/08/drawn-to-death-review	What an awesome excloosive
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	Bulletstorm came out in 2011 and its STILL better than most recent games like titanfall 2!! I sure hope they make a bulletstorm 2! I HIGHLY recommend this game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	Yeah, this game is overpriced.  $65 if you want the version that comes with Duke.  But its so much fun.  One of the most fun shooters that I have ever played.  And the game looks amazing.  It looks better now than it looked in 2011.  I just don't get the reviews for this and Drawn to Death. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	@captainexplosion69  all the reviews I have read on this game are all positive, I haven't read one negative review yet. bulletstorm is amazing and I would love a bulletstorm 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	Loved it when it came out but 60 bucks for this or 60 bucks for Persona 5/Horizon Zero Dawn/Nier Automata/MLB 17 et all is a nobrainer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	Lack of extras?  In a Gearbox game?  We're lucky it's playable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	@OnYourSix  there are a ton of echo maps
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	" Full clip?  Seriously?  Most of the guns in this game use magazines, not clips.  And no, I see no stripper-clips here.  The only clips in this game would be those on belt-fed ammo - the type of clips for which the ""full clip"" description won't apply."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	@DerBeowulf69 We get it, you're a gun enthusiast 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	"So, I've never played the original, and I picked this up over the weekend and played a few hours here and there.

Although the graphics are really nice and the leash is a novel idea, I can't really say that this is a great game.  I know shooters are ""linear"" in general, but this plays like a rail shooter.  I feel there's very little room to explore; I don't need Fallout or Elder Scrolls sized spaces to wander, but a few minutes to look around would be nice.

So I'm happy to see that the Unreal engine looks very nice on my machine; I'll have to look up more games that use it.  I wouldn't mind another Unreal Tournament, but I suppose that's a pipe dream.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	"@ThePurpleMarauder I hate saying this to people (but some games you do have to explain it) but, you're playing it wrong.

This game's main mechanic is about skill kills, once you get that idea into your head and pursue it, the game opens up.  It's not a game about exploration (there are some cool set pieces though), play it like an old school arcade game that's all about racking up a huge score."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	@ThePurpleMarauder  bulletstorm dosent need wide open spaces to explore, this game is about pure action which is the way all shooters should be. think of all the potential this game has for a sequel...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	Is this why it disappeared off Steam a while ago? So that the remaster could make a bigger splash on release?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	@Rembrandt.Q.Einstein It's so they could partner with G2A, the online marketplace of thieves and shady shit in another classic Gearbox fuck up.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	@Rembrandt.Q.Einstein This isn't the first time Gearbox has done this, for their re-release of Duke Nukem they took down all other versions of Duke Nukem, including Megaton edition and others that had content that the re-release doesn't have. I personally find it a bit questionable, especially in the case of Bulletstorm, a game that usually sells for something around $10, removing that version and replacing it with a full price remastered edition that doesn't really add much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	Good to see someone not give another unnecessary remaster top marks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/06/bulletstorm-full-clip-edition-review	 And to think developers wasted so much time and resources on this game than no one was even asking for.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	"Speaking of a ""lack of polish""; get a proofreader. That was painful to read. 😣"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	Been looking for a game like this for a decade. Will buy :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	I actually adored Capital Cashino and despised Glitterglaze Glacier. Each to their own though. Great review Marty!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	"Enjoying this game as it does feed the nostalgia fix i look for in platformers.

The music is great (as to be expected, they got the guy from DK country and the guy from Banjo Kazooie for the music...enough said) That blizzard world music is amaze balls.

I'm impressed with all of the worlds (even the casino one Marty didn't care for much) my favorite is probably Moodymaze Marsh. the borderline adult humor and innuendo and the characters are charming for the most part.

One issue with it is the camera (like pretty much everyone else says), not the worst camera in the world but definitely needs a tweak. 

My biggest concern however are the bugs that force me to restart the game and lose some progress. I don't know if anyone else is having this issue, or if it's only happening on the digital copy vs. the physical disc but it's a buzzkill. it got so bad on the blizzard level that it would not allow me to enter a section of the Crystalline Cave and i had to restart and lose progress. 

Another issue in the same world was the objective with the snowmen wouldn't allow me to complete due to the dialog box not opening and locking me into the conversation without being able to back up. They have a patch coming soon and i honestly haven't wanted a patch so bad in my life. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	I'll preface this by saying I'm someone who frequently replays BK/BT, so my review may be a bit biased. I had no issue with the camera, it's certainly far smoother than BK/BT. I also had no issue with the quizzes taking too long like I've read in many negative reviews - each took me less than a minute to complete, especially considering a rapid answer moves you two spaces ahead. If anything, I hoped the quizzes would be longer, however not a whole lot of character building happens ( one great feature about the original buddy duo games was getting to know the character you were helping out in each world). I was iffy about the first level, but as soon as I got to the second I was hooked, especially with the lush musical score ( familiar but refreshing). For me, YL hit a sweet spot of comfortable but new, despite being a bit slow to start for such a short game. The cheeky humor and classic 'wha-wha-wha' voice acting was very much appreciated too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	"""Not enough walking sim."" 7/10
Fucking Marty lol."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	This game is incredibly disappointing. The camera is just awful. The combat is terrible. The first boss battle is frustratingly cheap. This game just isn't as good as it looks. Banjo and Kazooie would not be proud.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	 Ah, I get it now. Of course Marty reviewed it. He simply is an awful critic. He was probably feeling moody when he reviewed this and had to vent his melodrama at the first opportunity, like a doofy brat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	It's not a walking sim so it must be shit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	@drdeleon i really like this game, but i don't necessarily disagree with Marty on this one man. idk about you guys but this game as been buggy as shit on my PS4 forcing me to restart a few times now because i couldn't progress and as a result, lost progress and had to do some objectives over again which got old quick. His critique is spot on with that camera too. It's not the worst cam but as a point of reference, R&C had an amazing camera, no reason this one should be as bad as it is in 2017. 7.5 out of 10 for me. but to each his own of course.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	Obnoxiously over-critical review.  The game is great. if you are interested you will love it. I don't understand why people are so harsh on this game but so lax on buggy , overdone, unbalanced franchises like certain overrated rpg's and fps's. The only gripe that holds any water is the camera--and still this is greatly overstated. The camera isn't like other 3rd person games like Dark Souls where you have absolute control over the camera movement. in yooka laylee you can control the camera just about as much you would ever need, but it is limited.. occasionally the camera is fixed, and only certain areas are actually limited. i feel like this was a design call--certain areas would be too easy if you had free reign over the camera
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	What can I say, it's a Marty Saliva review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	I haven't played this game, but after reading the review it definitely did not sound like a 7/10 game to me. Camera issues and 1 lackluster world seemed to be the only main gripes the reviewer had, and that alone shouldn't equate to three points' worth of deductions. My impression from this review is that it's an 8 or 8.5.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/yooka-laylee-review	Anytime the reviewers biggest problem is that it doesn't have enough levels or isn't long enough and subsequently gives a low score I get confused. You want to keep playing it, but it isn't great?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	I bought this game on a whim and am really enjoying it. I found it incredibly frustrating at first, trying to learn the controls was a pain! However it's paid off taking the time to learn it because now I'm loving the heck out of it. I had small issues with the camera but no worse then a lot of other games I've played. Honestly I thought the checkpoint system was just fine, anything else would have just made it much easier. Wish the game could have had an actual story and have been a bit longer, good potential for a sequel (perhaps bought by Nintendo :D).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	Ended up hating this, refunded it on Steam.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	looks like the only ultra original idea that I've seen in a long time...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	The checkpoint system works fine. It's what gives the game a challenge. If you finally get that difficult coin go and find a checkpoint, there is usually one close by. Let's say the game didn't use checkpoints and it auto saved after every collectable. That would make the game too easy. You could simply do a leap of faith to get the coins. Then it would get a negative review for not using checkpoints. Sometimes no matter what a game does people will complain. The game is frustrating as hell. But that made me want to master the controls and eventually I got pretty good at it. Now I am on level 8 with all collectables collected. There is no way this reviewer beat all 15 levels in 5 hours. If he did he obviously only collected the required 3 gems. If that's the case he has no right reviewing this game. The camera does suck and has caused me many deaths. That is my only issue with the game. But overall it's a good unique game. It's not for everyone but if you're interested I'd recommend it. It is a very frustrating game especially the beginning when you are learning but if you stick with it you will get much better. Also don't expect a story. There isn't one. You just go to 15 world's collecting gems, blue orbs and coins. I'd give the game a 7.5/10.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	"I'll never understand why so many games which should become beloved classics completely fail to do it because despite bringing creative and innovative gameplay mechanics, they completely and utterly screw up the basics.

I mean, yes, this game is inventing basically a new form of control that's appropiate for a snake, which sounds like a fun new idea, but they manage to screw up camera and checkpoints, which is stuff that everyone should know how to properly do by now.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	"@Dreadjaws I agree with you on checkpoints, but as a lifelong platformer fan, I can tell you that 3D platformers with good camera are much, much rarer than their failing counterparts.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/snake-pass-review	This looks like a game Nintendo should have intercepted during development. This looks like it could have been an awesome Donkey Kong Country spinoff. They could have called it Rattly the Rattlesnake and with their involvement the camera and check point issues would have likely been addressed.

Heck even Switch, you are talking about at least comparable to Wii U when in portable mode.  If you don't have time to play on the big screen, that's nothing to be sneezed at."

I don't care what system it was on, what system it is on, what system it will be on in the future; if you're stupid enough to pay full AAA-tier price for a 4-year old game, you're an idiot."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/04/04/lego-city-undercover-review-2	Pretty sure Skyrim remastered sold like hot cakes as well. I refused to buy it again, even if I did finally get a stable frame rate. I just MAY pick it up on Switch though as long as the performance is good. It would be awesome to have on the go
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	Just finished the game about 120hrs. Amazing game absolutely loved it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	new comer, 10 hours in.. game is so effin good
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	Just ordered this. First game I'll have played since end of 2016. Looking forward to it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	I can't get enough of this game, and I am so excited for the anime coming soon. This is GOTY for sure.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	"I am 17 hours in and I don't know why I'm still playing this! It's really stupid, has soooo many issues and yet I just can't stop play!!!

I don't know if it is great or they have just invented video game crack!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	After finally getting around to playing this game i think im playing a whole different game to the review scores as im 3 plus hours in and apart from the opening i have found it to be just a lot of reading boring game i just cant seem to get into it at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	@MikeArob You should give it a chance. You have to play for like 10 hours to get out of the intro section. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	"@MikeArob You don't seem to know any Persona games just by this. The game starts with everything automatic, it makes you go home without crossing the entire city, you can't walk freely, etc... This is just the tutorial, just like your parents hold you when you were learning how to walk, the game is trying to make you get used to basics first, after this... You'll play the real game, be careful about spending your time, walking everywhere, deciding when you'll to the things, etc.

My brother loves the Persona games, and only finished this one with almost 150 hours. You still have A LOOOT to go ;)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	@KronckTEE @MikeArob  Yeah i'm not giving up i am going to see it through nice to know that at 3 hours in i'm still only on tutorial so the best is yet to come. I must admit the opening sequence was good so if there is more like that to come i'm all for carrying on.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	@MikeArob No JRPG shows its true colours 3 hours in. I put about 10-15 hours into the game before I realised how special it was. It opens up something new everytime you play. Give it a shot if you haven't already. The game is a masterpiece
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	"So having finally finished it a few months after release, I can say this is one of the best games I've ever played. Persona 5 isn't perfect. IMO some of the translations (especially Ryuji) were often laughable and the game went on for about 20 hours longer than I would have preferred. Still I'll never forget my adventures with the Phantom Thieves and anyone that is even remotely interested in JRPGs absolutely needs to play this. The game is dripping with style, the combat is solid and deeper than meets the eye, the characters are lovable and the story very engaging. 

I'm going to put a significant amount of time between today's completion and New Game Plus, but I have a lot to look forward to at least."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	Great game! I kinda wish this game came out on PS Vita too just like Persona 4 Golden.

Nothing about this game interests me. This feels like something Nintendo would make where it gets good reviews just because...well...who knows why?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/29/persona-5-review	"@PrincePlusRevolution

At 1:10 they are staring at a wall with nothing on screen more than a few feet away and no other characters present, and in dungeons you are usually navigating tight corridors or empty areas so you rarely see anyone from 20 feet away.  

Are you talking about the sections where they are wandering through real world Tokyo?  Because while the game has some grubby textures at points, the people fading in and out as they walk around was a deliberate stylistic choice as being surrounded by the faceless masses is very much related to the themes of the story.  It's the same reason why all those speech bubbles whispering rumors appear out of nowhere while you wander around the real world.  

Also, IGN, erase whatever code you use to display videos and start from scratch.  It would probably work better if you had someone input the videos in binary, jeez.  "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/rain-world-review	@JimmyTheKing Bro, I was bloody joking. Sorry if your misunderstood what I was saying.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/rain-world-review	@JimmyTheKing It's a really squirrely game to play. It's a really neat game that will fire up your imagination, but no amount of skill will keep you from accidental deaths. A perfectly-tuned gameplay system would have speedruns and 100%/NoDeath runs as the ultimate challenge (you can get perfect at Ninja Gaiden or other super-hard games) but some games just don't aim to play that way and allow some flexibility of motion to help and also hurt you.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/rain-world-review	What's the point in a challenge if it's not a well designed challenge. Joe didn't think it was a well designed challenge, so felt beating it wasn't rewarding enough to be worth the effort. I didn't misunderstand what you said at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/rain-world-review	I'm just commenting on Joes review, he found the game more frustrating than it was worth to beat. He gave his reasons why he thinks the difficulty is an unsatisfying type of difficulty, people just chose to ignore his perspective.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/rain-world-review	 I just finished Hollow Knight which was this years version of Owlboy on PC. a Great game imo. Rain World seems ok. i dont mind hard games tbh.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/rain-world-review	@metalhead9806 hollow knight is amazing. Im taking my time with it and it pays off. Funny thing though I havent died remotely the times I have seen other people have. I expected it to be much much harder based on reviews etc. The only time I kept dying is on the optional Dream False Knight cause I was way too weak to kill him and even then I got him to the second stage of the fight, I just got some stuff and when I returned it was a breeze.

I'm not sure how you can say it was boring after an hour and nothing changed considering it's metroidvania and the very nature of the genre is the opposite of what you're describing.
But regardless of all of that, I was talking purely about the visuals with the comments I made in my original post."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/mlb-the-show-17-review	One of the worst sports games. If you love destroying the computer for 9 innings with perfect pitches on the corners all game just to have the game shoot liners in the corner and beat you 5-0 while their pitcher is a 74 overall that throws batting practice pitches that end up in the defenders gloves over and over and over and over, then this game is for you!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/mlb-the-show-17-review	"This game is so bad.
Pitchers block hit balls more than goalies in an NHL game. Tagging runners is terribly broken. Most bunts go 150 feet. SERVERS ARE GETTING WORSE A MONTH AFTER RELEASE! Teleporting outfielders. The game mechanics are just so horrible, there is no logic. Too many things are just random.
IGN- you are not a reputable game reviewer after giving this broken garbage such a high mark. How much did they pay you? The level of accountability lacking from this game developer is criminal at this point. THEY HAVE STOLEN PEOPLE'S MONEY!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/mlb-the-show-17-review	This game is BS. Play on beginner you win 26-0. Too easy. Put the difficulty up...impossible. Shut out game going for 6 innings, up 6-0. 7th whether you put a relief pitcher in or leave your starter...the AI will always catch up. The hitters hit about 6-7 fouls in a row until they get a hit or a HR...every game. (16 games in franchise so far...1-15, ya). Never get any runs in late in the game...ever. How is shitty AI like this passable?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/mlb-the-show-17-review	@Dave4420  sounds like you blow at the game.  all star batting is more realistic then any sports simulation I have ever seen.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/27/mlb-the-show-17-review	@DRock252  The game is fantastic and huge upgrades to gameplay both suttle and in your face.

The game play differences are not groundbreaking and IMO could've been addressed 4 versions ago in a simple update.  The paywall for created players has only gotten higher.  SO if you wanna bring yourself through the minors and into a superstar anticipate it feeling like an actual career. Think ""Boom Beach"" if you don't buy any diamonds.

It appears to me this game has received the accolades you read by getting you to play less.  That's right ladies and gentlemen, you can cut the 45 min game into mere 3 minute intervals (Which I thought we basically did last year). 

Do you enjoy the feeling of slow, almost aquatic game play movements trapped within motion captured vanilla plays?  Well you've come to the right place.  Every action feels like pushing play on your dvd player complete with a load time.

Seriously.... This BS is only acceptable to a generation raised on selling you the same game year after year.  Baseball is slow in between moments of action.  We can't have the action slow too.  This game deserves the same rating its received since 2013 with a 1 point reduction for each year following for giving us almost exactly the same game."

I used a  Heavy +10 Exiled Greatsword, two-handed. I hit the head which stops him from doing the side swipe, then I go under him and hit the tail when he does the flame AoE. (Face forward while hitting tail to time-dodge the tail swipe).
Dive left for the aerial flame attack and you're good to go.(Forward lunge needs a bit of luck to dodge).

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	this game has many elements that I love. I love the gameplay, but what i dont really like is once you die, like the review said, you are back to square one. I'd like it if there was some sort of progression or something. To give an example, let's say I want to fight that Captain Hook like boss after failing once, chances are i will rarely see him again. it makes me curious for the many other bosses this game offers, but constantly going back to zero kinda kills it. all the effort i did to beat a certain boss is lost. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	"All I can say is either the reviewer didn't really play a dozen hours or he somehow didn't understand the basic fundamentals of the game. More than likely his claim of playing a dozen hours is untrue. While the game is unforgiving and doesn't explain much, it's almost impossible to NOT learn through trial and error.
At 90 minutes in, I felt a little frustrated. I'd gotten to the second boss (which, by the way, is the final boss) three times but just couldn't quite clinch it. I had read this review and felt maybe he was right, however something clicked over the next 30 minutes and I just understood the combat a lot better. I realized what a powerhouse the rogue is with +10 melee damage items, how invaluable the monk was with new spells and faster spell recharge and how potent the warrior was with +percent damage and defense. Judicious use of the easily obtainable non elemental spells early on and smart lane swapping saw me getting to the second boss in a matter of under ten minutes each run and before the end of 3 hours I had beaten the game and unlocked my first bonus hero.
At this point, the game really begins. Beating the game unlocks 75+ new objects for the game. New items, new spells, new enemies, new biomes, new rooms/areas, new bosses and one new hero (the Bard, a replacement for the monk who's more healing focused). Every time you beat the game you unlock a similar amount of objects for the game as well as a new hero and you add one new area to the game length. So.. to beat the game the first time you need only clear two areas and two bosses. To beat it a second time, you must clear three areas and three bosses. To beat it a third, you must clear four areas and four bosses. This pattern continues, with the final boss always being a new elemental variation of the same final boss you fought early on (albeit with some new tricks and minions each time)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	Reviewer is lazy :(.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	Small correction of the review: On console you can’t see an item’s description the first time you find it. Once you’ve picked it up once, it’s stats will be displayed when you find the item in a future game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	"I read this review, but bought the game anyhow. ...and when I was at a place in this game where our reviewer was, (able to sometimes beat the first boss but not the second) I was dead set to agree with this review. This game seemed overly hard and the mechanics weren't well explained.
But then it clicked. It’s not just about using the warrior to cause big damage, as described in the review, which only works well on enemies with 3 or fewer stamina. The trick to battling is to permanently remove enemy stamina by stunning them (dropping their stamina to zero without dealing any damage), and then hitting them with any hero to reduce their stamina by 1, permanently. …And an enemy with no stamina is a sitting duck, even if it’s a boss.

By using spells and abilities in addition to basic attacks, you can find many creative ways to rapidly strip enemies of their stamina."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	"Apparently the reviewer didn't put any effort or time into this game....
It's obvious that he didn't even figure out the mechanics.
The game didn't get good scores at other places because mostly the critics didn't get it, they are so use to of hand holding that when a game came out with new ideas and you have to figure it out, the reviewers just didn't bother and gave it a low score.... shame on you.
I have it on switch and have spent hours into it now and still loving it. It's not even that hard when you figure out the mechanics, although that may take a while."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	 This is getting bad reviews from almost everywhere. Shame, looked good.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	"It is good... the reviews don't do it justice. The game is designed for hours upon hours of gameplay and I find it more fun 20 hours in than when I started playing and it's not because I'm getting better but because more enemies and items are unlocking and the game is starting to take a different form. My average playthrough when I started was 20 minutes. My last clear took me 3+hours and at the point I'm at there is no luck involved it is all strategy.
When you first start there is barely any items in the game. As you play and die you unlock more items for your next try. Eventually at some point you will luck out and beat the game and after that everything starts snowballing and the game starts to change. You get access to more spell element, heroes, venders, enemies, ect, ect..
If you look at the video footage of this review you'll see the reviewer has next to no items. This is a 40+ hour game and they played it for maybe four hours. At 20 hours I have barely scratched the surface and still have a ton of things to unlock. I honestly wouldn't have bought the game but I seen some developer footage where they explained the game and I read the user reviews on steam. There are also a lot of streams on twitch if you're interested. I think this game is going to become very popular and a lot of these reviews are going to be changed like final fantasy tactics which when released in 1998 most of the scores were 6 and under because nobody understood the game because it was ""different"" from other final fantasys. Now almost all those reviews have been changed and it's average score is 9+."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	@Klasius1  Thanks for the very informative comment. I'll have to check out Twitch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	@Klasius1  I've only been playing for a few hours but have a few things unlocked but have no idea what to do with them.  I still start the game with the same things I did when I first started playing.  Am I missing something?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	@shinitaru @Klasius1 No, you don't have to do anything with them. They just get added to the item pool on your next run. Then when you find them you unlock the item description. It might not seem like a huge change but you unlock a ton of stuff when you get your first couple clears as well.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	It's a good game reviewers are lazy all across the board every early review misunderstood the mechanics
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	It's a very good game at least on switch I am having a blast. Critics these days have gotten so lazy they didn't even bother to figure new mechanics and gave the game a low score. It is a wonderful game, once you figure out the mechanics it's not even that hard. It's definitely worth the $20 price tag and in exchange it offers several hours of intense fun
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	"Been sinking quite a bit of time into this game since launch... and this reviewer is a sad excuse for a gamer.   This game is at least an 8.0, with a lot of gameplay depth...  it requires thought and to be successful, planning.   With tons of unlockable heroes that have their own stats, it gives plenty of ways to build your group of heroes...  each hero has different spell slots that buff certain types of spells if you put them in that slot and tons of items that alter your heroes melee dmg, spells, stamina and health.... not to mention that spells can be used in succession in order to have additional effects.

You need to manage the amount of hits your hero does with the amount of stamina the enemy has to manage stuns, which result in being able to do more dmg.....   I could go on and on.... but you probably don't want to read another long review.

TLDR version... the game looks simple, but has a lot of depth...  its the thinking man's version of Plants vs Zombies. I love Plants vs Zombies... but Has Been Heroes is simply, better."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/24/has-been-heroes-review	Most Roguelike games are hard and not as repetive as this game. Having different and unique enemies and different strategies can make a game great. This game fails in that department. Ign not only reviewer giving this game bad scores. Do a bit research on it. It has a ton bad reviews. 20 not much for a game. But 20 for a game that is repetive in few hours of play time and based solely on luck of the draw is a bad investment.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	SO...let's just say that I hate Reddit and most of the Internet for nearly programming me to hate this amazing game. They had me regretting my digital pre-order and hating BioWare for no good reason, so Andromeda went into the backlog. Now that I am a good 25% into the game, and most of the crap stuff has been patched, I'm just not seeing what's wrong with this game. I feel like any issue people were having with facial animations were for a few characters on the Nexus who, quite frankly, I rarely ever re-visit anymore. And let's be real, Humans were never interesting in ME games anyway so WHO CARES? The other races look magnificent! And this is HANDS DOWN the best gameplay of any ME game, plus we are building a new life in the freaking Andromeda galaxy. I love Andromeda so much, man. And I will never allow the control system sway my opinion ever again...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"@ToinyeWest next time you guys should listen to me. i had been telling people since launch that what people were saying wasnt true

i actually like it just as much as the other Mass Effects "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	@brokeassgamer  I had plenty of other games to get through back then, so it all worked out fine.  It's just a shame BioWare is putting the series on ice for awhile after this PR distaster.   We never even got a Trilogy Remaster for current gen, which sucks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"Here i am again... now is when i wish EA would be greedy. I would love some DLC for this game. Charge me 40 bucks... i don't care, This was one of my favorite games this generation. 

I'll keep posting until dlc is released! "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	So I bought this game when it released, and finally started playing it this weekend since I now have the the time. Honestly, I'm glad I waited because it seems they patched the game significantly enough. I've already invested probably about 10 hours into the game so far and feel like I've barely scratched the surface of it. It's a pretty damn solid game, and a lot better than people are giving it credit for (at least now it is). It still very much feels like Mass Effect, and even though the story isn't nearly as intriguing as the first 3; it still holds it weight pretty well especially in comparison to some of the other games on the current market.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"@LordKri Which is why I've been on here preaching lol. You can't always trust the internet when it come to video game reviews. Even from launch i had no problems with the game. 

Very good game. Glad another person is on the same page"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	@brokeassgamer @LordKri Lol well I'm glad you've been, because this game definitely deserves better. Update too, I'm about 20 hours or so in, and I still very much enjoy it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	Liking the demo way more than expected. Only a few hours in but seems worth buying now as it is on sale. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"@FatboyFresh indeed it is my friend. one of the most overwhelming games I've ever played... it's huge. 

this is why hate on the internet isn't always accurate. the game is like 30 bucks now... i say you go buy that! make me proud!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"it amazes me this game still is getting comments (a lot more positive lately) and there's still over 1000 people viewing this review... WOW

this game is worth the 30 dollars they are charging for it. it's my favorite rpg in a while. i enjoyed it more than skyrim or fallout 4"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	Just downloaded the demo on PS4 and now I'm going to go buy it. I always heard bad things about this game but it's been a blast to play so far. Reminds me of dragon age with guns. This looks AMAZING on my new C7 oled with HDR and the PS4pro. The little lights that are on everything like guns and armor look surreal. The lightning makes me squint my eyes when it strikes just like if it was outside. HDR is such a game changer with OLED.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"@angryrussian76$ if you read a lot of my older posts (since release) you will see me saying how good of a game it is. the facial animations never really bothered me

i feel like the cast could've been a little better... and i feel like SOME animations were on the lacking side. 

i would rate this game like a 8.9 - 9 . 0 now that I've had time to think about it"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	I've been using the x5 ghost throughout and have to say I'm surprised no one is appreciating it for the beast that it is. With my mods and stat boosts it does 80 damage, has a 128 bullet clip and fires of those rounds at a 600 fire rate. With the auto reload with 5% health mode and an incendiary ammo add on, this basically means that I can chew through anything at medium range within seconds. It's not for long range but that's what I have the black widow for. It's incredibly satisfying to just hover and unload my x5 on pretty much anything with the 35% damage boost and watch as even a behemoth gets helplessly chewed up. I barely use any of the powers either as this one gun carries 90% of the work in every battle! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"@BeknIghted
Feels like the accuracy isn't what the stats say...or its just me "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/20/mass-effect-andromeda-review	"The 7.7 seems a bit low and I suspect it's been calculated based on the difference between the reviewer's expectations from the game and what the game has been able to deliver. 
Clearly, the sense of wonder that the first Me inspired can not be replicated by a game in the same franchise, that's a trick that only works once. But on its own, ME:A is a lot of fun and my score for it would hover around a 9. The combat is frenetic and a hug d improvement over previous games thanks to the added mobility and the story beats are also consistently interesting. For e very decision that seems inconsequential, the possibility of it making a difference in dlc and sequels is ever present. The only major weakness is in the form of companions. They are fairly generic and the bonds between them and th ed protagonist are not crafted as vividly and organically as in past games. Plus the limited control over how they level up makes them all interchangeable without any one standing out like Garrus did. 
It's still a very enjoyable ride that satisfies while creating excitement and curiosity for the sequels and has a couple of good plot lines that flow well together and provide surprises and thrills a plenty.
There are a lot of improvements required, such as making both the shopping and crafting system more meaningful and providing either a narrower focus for abilities or greater access to utilizing the available choices, but I'm hopeful these will fit ironed out with future games. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	Umm, the pink things look a little too...feminine? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	"So, help me out here. I have a Switch, saw the 9.0, and I was on the fence so I bought the vanilla for $5 on steam. I played it for an hour and-- to a lot of you who ""love"" it-- what's the appeal?
Impressions:
Really grim, lots of death, blood and poop lol. 
Some creative creatures, I'll say that. The art and color is a bit bland, even tho I know it doesn't want to be Mario-sparkly.
Lots and lots of wet sound effects of little tear-bubbles splatting. Didn't love the ""feel"" of it. Not as satisfying as Enter the Gungeon or others.
Had a hard time figuring out collision of bullets
Amazing music. (best part IMO)
Story is meh, but has a very distinct atmosphere (I researched the story a lot on Edmund McMillen's blog)

Overall, I think the feel of the controls were the biggest turn off, and I didn't really love the atmosphere. Maybe I just don't get what's so great about it. I guess I don't like wallowing in sadness covered with blood, poop and flies.¯\_(ツ)_/¯"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	"@suprkong  The controls absolutely take some getting used to, especially the feel of shooting. It's fairly heavily momentum-based, and is rather odd at first, but once you figure it out it comes rather naturally. 

The dark feel is part of the appeal, really; kind of like FNaF, the game is supposed to be rather grim, with a story that already feels bleak at the top level, and only gets more and more miserable the deeper you go. Personally, I love stuff like this, but I can certainly understand why one might not enjoy it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	"@Korrsair @suprkong  Good response.
I think if the shooting ""felt"" better to me- and when I say that I mean, if it weren't tears but say, daggers, you shot and they had a hard-hitting THWOK sound when you hit stuff, I'd like it better. I just kind of didn't like shooting these soft little tear-drops and hearing everything splat and slosh and cry and fart. lol

It's hard to put my finger on, but I'm trying to say, the dark grimness of it doesn't always turn me off. Example: Dark Souls 3 is one of my favs. That game feels lonely and sad, but I love it. I just didn't enjoy the shooting part of this shooter, if that makes sense."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	@suprkong I really enjoy just shooting things and seeing how every time you play the environment changes. In a weird way, it feeds the Contra games shooting fan in me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	Found the physical version finally.  I love the game.  One really neat feature is that you can take a screenshot of the provided password during a run that you particularly like........and input it to play that same run again.  Awesome.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/the-binding-of-isaac-afterbirth-review	I played the Original on the Vita and I was hooked. Such a great game. I had a hard time finding the switch version but I was able to snag a copy last night. Cant wait to get home tonight and play some.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/flatout-4-total-insanity-review	Driving games after nearly 3 decades are still getting it WRONG!!!!!! It's already bad enough that when I tell Microsoft's Forza Horizon that no car in the universe runs like it has glass tires on a track made of solid ice, so they try to compensate with a Hotwheels plastic edition... But forever now, from Playstation, Dreamcast, Nintendo, you name it, there has always been this BAD HABIT, that one slightly tap or turn, that your car rediculously needs to throw its ass to the front. Not turn around and you can still face forward...but literally, constantly, even if a fly hits your windshield, stick your ass to the front. Let me tell ALL of you ignorant programmers for the past 20 years.... THAT IS SCIENTIFICALLY IMPOSSIBLE!!!!! Nowhere in the universe does anything in a constant forward motion, instantly, for no reason, need to stick its ass to the front.... STOP IT already....and this game again proves the ignorance of programmers knowledge of momentum. Every 3 seconds, the vehicle loses control and needs to stick its ass to the front.....IMPOSSIBLE!!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/flatout-4-total-insanity-review	I don't recommend this game to any one. I wasted 49,99€ on the worst racing game ever made.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/flatout-4-total-insanity-review	Wow Ign was generous with this score. The review i read said the graphics wouldn't look out of place on the ps2 and the controls are complete rubbish.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/17/flatout-4-total-insanity-review	"@deviltaz33 Well, I think the visuals are uneven but, while I don't love the handling, I wouldn't call it garbage.

But personally I'd balk at any analysis that claims anything less than cutting-edge visuals are ""PS2 graphics."" I'd imagine the writer hasn't played a PS2 game in over a decade, if that's the case."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	Never actually played the original!  Was one of those NES games I wanted to play, just never got around to. Wish I had....

Either way, I still love this game to death. I could care less if it's easy, it's still super addicting and fun."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	That's funny they talk about the game being too easy when the original was imo too hard.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	@jogant Yeah, kind of ironic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	Who runs Bartertown?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	"I was a huge fan of the original game, but I never beat it. I could rarely get past the 3rd boss (Photophage), so I didn't ever beat the game. IGN did a review of the Wii Virtual Console version back in 2009 (http://www.ign.com/articles/2009/12/15/blaster-master-review?page=2), and mentioned one of the most irritating things about the original: it was so hard, very few people beat it. The Wii Virtual Console introduced a save state feature that made it more likely. This version just turns the whole thing into a faceroll.

However, it's obvious for any fan that this game is an homage to the original in just about every way. If you spent days of your life working your way through the original, the combat in this feels like payback. The save feature feels like reprieve, and so many of the frustrating control issues have been resolved. They even cleaned up the story so it's at least quasi-plausible!

I don't see this reboot as a serious remake of one of the best games for the original NES. I see it as a tribute, made by fans, for fans. It's so refreshing to cruise through the game, following a built-in walkthrough, while enjoying the cleverness of the hybrid platform design. It's a thing of beauty!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	Bet you anything I can beat Blaster Master on Master without using the Master cheat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	Can't wait for the Movie..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	This game is set up for speed running. Its made by IntiCreates ffs. Does anybody at IGN pay attention to these types of things? The challenge comes from lowering your completion time. The combat is meant to be easy so you can blow through the game quicker each time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	@welikehonda they are saying the game isnt very fun, why would they want to play through it multiple times? Boring combat isnt something you can excuse by saying it sucks on purpose.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	@chuchumyrocket @welikehonda  They can say it isn't fun and that's their opinion. I enjoy the game and felt like pointing out it was set up for speed running which is something that wasn't mentioned in the review. What was the last IntiCreates game that wasn't good for speed running? Azure Striker Gunvolt doesn't get any crap for being a breeze until you figure out the next boss pattern so this game shouldn't either.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	@welikehonda @chuchumyrocket I'm not familiar with the dev or this game, I just clicked because I'm a fan of the original. What i do know is there are a ton of games that lend themselves to speed runs that are challenging and in that challenge comes the fun. That's all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	"@chuchumyrocket @welikehonda  It's about as difficult as your average modern game, i.e. it's designed to be completed.  Old-school aesthetic without the old-school difficulty.  Also, a 7/10 is still fun, according to IGN.

Personally, I'd score the game higher.  Kicking the crap out of everything is awesome."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	"I hope Nintendo keeps going with this business model. A handful of AAA first party games with the quality of BotW and the new Mario with a bunch of these retro quasi HD ""Reboots"" of classic games from NES and SNES."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/15/blaster-master-zero-review	Capcom should make a Captain Capcom remake with much better graphics. And Nintendo to make a Super Metroid remake 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review	"""...and since the co-op mode doesn't support the ability to save anywhere, it's a recipe for gnashed teeth rather than good times""
This must have been fixed with a patch/update. You can't quick save, but you can save anywhere while playing co-op.
 
However, the co-op mode it pretty broken in this game.  I've absolutely loved the game, but a pretty big bug causes players to lose all their skill upgrades throughout the campaign, with no way to get them back.   It doesn't happen in single player though."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review	Solid stealth game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review	my god this looks horrid
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review	I was hoping they would forgo recycling levels this time around.

It was the ""Thief"" game I wanted, since 2014's Thief failed to deliver for me. Unfortunately, this one is coming out when I am extremely backlogged in games. I'll definitely pick it up when I have time to play it, and by then it'll likely be $20."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/14/styx-shards-of-darkness-review	This game looks fairly fun.  May be something worth keeping on the lookout for in the bargain/pre-owned bins in the future.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	One of the games I intend to try out when I get a PS VR, haven't played the first game yet but planning to. Looks good and I like most of the games by Tim Schafer, so my interest is pretty high.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	PSVR really needs a price drop... especially with oculus, a far superior product is only $100 more.  Or maybe just an update to be able to use Oculus on the ps4 would be okay too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@twerkstaloak With PSVR selling just under 1 million, I don't think Sony will be dropping the price anytime soon, as it looks to have roughly sold more than Vive and Rift combined in only 4 months. Demand for PSVR still seems pretty high at the moment because Sony didn't make enough units, thinking it would sell slower than it actually has.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	Now all I need is somebody willing to rent me a PSVR for the next 3 days.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	I was a bit worried.  I almost thought this was the sequel.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	It technically is, but this isn't the crowdfunded game. This bridges the gap between Psychonauts 1 and 2 while setting up the villain for Psychonauts 2.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"I wasn't a big fan of this game.  It was ok, but I think my nostalgic memories of the original made my expectations a little too high.
It was cute and witty, but the teleport-based movement is getting annoying (many VR owners are getting tired of the teleport style), the puzzles were rather simplistic, and so much time was spent just following along a linear path (of fish) to get to different areas.
I understand it is just a bridge between Psychonauts 1 and 2, and glad its cheap, but it won't be a VR titles that I have strong memories of."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"Well, until they can find a way to lessen the motion sickness when you move without teleporting, teleporting is the cheapest method we have... unless you want to spend $800 additionally on a 360 degree ""treadmill"" to track your movements in real life."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	More games need to have a choice between teleporting and smooth movement in their settings. I think the motion sickness from VR movement mainly hits those that don't have their VR legs yet, but once your brain is used to playing VR, there's no need to use the teleport. At least that's my case. Got plenty sick first couple weeks of owning a PSVR, but now I feel absolutely fine playing games with the comfort settings minimized.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	Games like Resident Evil 7 have proved to me that the teleport movement system is simply not necessary. Blink turning, and full locomotion all the way!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"@WTGHookie There is a way to lessen motion sickness... keep playing!  Only a selection of people experience motion sickness with VR from the outset, and most of these get past that sickness after a couple of weeks by playing in short bursts... after that they can spend hours in RIGS or Robinson without even breaking a sweat.
Teleportation kills the immersion and is just not necessary... by all means give both options, but to omit free-movement entirely is just keeping the medium held back.
And no... you don't need a 360 treadmill for free-movement... just a DS4 like any other game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"@FortescueHaljournon @WTGHookie  That doesn't always work. There are some people who still get naturally motion sick playing regular games on a 2D television. People's difference in motion sickness is vastly different across the board. I mean, are you really telling me people who get motion sickness driving in a car just need to keep driving in a car, despite having driven and ridden in a car for decades of their life already?

A DS4 causes a disconnect within the body. Your mind sees you are moving but your proprioception and equilibrioception (bodily awareness sense and balance/equilibrium sense, respectively) do not coincide with that, which is what causes the disconnect. Which is why more people get sick with DS4 movement compared to teleporting. Now, a game like RIGS or Battlezone can help trick that feeling, because you are in a vehicle, sitting down, which mimics you sitting down in a chair playing, so your body's proprioception and equilibrioception feel compensated for.

This is the same exact reason why they also have the ""floating hands"" instead of hands connected to an arm reaching back towards your body in VR games. Because your arms and my arms and the guy's arms in the game are not the same; they are not in the same place or the same length or move identically to each other. So, when your eyes see the arms still attached and they aren't where they are supposed to be for your real life body, your proprioception causes there to be a disconnect and it causes sickness. Every person is affected differently by VR; some can handle it naturally better than others. However, developers are not content on only making games for those who can handle it in its current incarnation."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@pocketcommie  And that will be the case for many people. However, many people won't have that be the case. There are people who have spent decades riding and driving in cars and STILL get motion sickness from a car ride. I myself am not super susceptible to VR motion sickness, but I have a friend who plays more VR than I do and still gets sick every single time. Heck, I read an article about a VR developer who literally has to take medicine to help him develop his VR games because his body naturally won't get used to it... a VR developer for crying out loud, someone who uses VR LITERALLY everyday for his job... Everyone is hit differently, just like people who get sick on airplanes or have sea sickness.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"@THANA108  Simply not necessary... for you. Some people who were used to VR still got sick with Resident Evil 7. There isn't a one size fits all; just because you didn't get sick, that doesn't mean others don't. I say this from experience, as I am like you, I don't really get sick with VR. But I have a friend who has a Vive, Rift, and PS VR and plays it 10 times more than I play my PS VR and he gets sick each and every time he plays. Everybody's body is different and reacts differently to VR.

Resident Evil 7 also was very slow in its movements, so it was vastly easier to cope with for many people. And that will work... for slow games like Resident Evil 7. But playing a game like Quake 3 in VR? That's a different story."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"@WTGHookie @FortescueHaljournon My comment was based on actual people from two global and one Australia PSVR Facebook groups where a reasonable majority of people do not experience any notable VR sickness, and the vast majority of those that DO experience sickness get over it after a short while.  There are indeed a few who don't seem to get over it and sell it, but I can't help but wonder how many of these may do so prematurely.
There's definitely merit to the notion of taking pills, or ginger, or even having a fan blowing on you to help you get past the sickness... but these are just a means to an end.
The point is... VR sickness is not as bigger issue as some would have us believe, and I certainly don't think that they should restrict movement options based solely on the few who can't get over it... again, at the very least, it should be an option for each game.
Your other point about the cause of VR sickness certainly sounds logical... but the problem I have with that theory (I have debated this with many others!) is that it doesn't explain how I can be sick in one full-movement game but fine in another.  e.g. I can spend hours in RE7 with smooth turning enabled... but I still get a little queasy no longer than an hour into Robinson.  Both have similarly detailed graphics, both have the same controls and smooth turning options, both have visual anchors (guns in RE7, the scanner in Robinson)... but in spite of these similarities, one causes mild sickness in me.  Then there is the fact that some people get sick with Robinson but are fine with RE7, but then there are others that are vice versa, getting sick from RE7 but are fine with Robinson."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	IMO you are basing your opinion on theory. You say moving faster would make motion sickness worse for 360 movement. But that's not my experience, in The Windlands you are sprinting and swinging around like Spiderman, and I don't get sick from that either. But if I turn on smooth turning it's instant sickness.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"I didn't know this came out. The last game I played on VR was RE7. I am going to check this when I am done with Zelda and Horizon.
I just noticed there are no physical copies :("
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@Vicdsnew which one are you liking more?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"Both are very good but I am enjoying Zelda more. The amount of things you can do in that world is amazing. I feel I am in a real living world and I never get tired of playing it. It makes me want to go adventuring more.
Horizon is an eye candy. When I play it, I crank up the volume and I feel it is more of a cinematic experience. HDR is awesome."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@Vicdsnew Horizon is a stupendously good looking game, not sure if it has the depth of play to back it up yet though. Just finished the first caldron and I was more impressed by the visuals than the gameplay. Did you get the Switch Zelda or Wii U? If it is Switch how are you finding it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	I got the Switch version. I am playing it on handheld mode and it is very comfortable lol. I play it like a lazy person resting on the bed XD
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@ReverendR @Vicdsnew The switch version is a dream come true. I want nothing more than to play it all day, every day. One of the most engrossing games I've played. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@Vicdsnew Is it worth getting a Switch just for Zelda?  Serious question
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"Umm It depends how much you will love Zelda lol. I would say.. never buy a system for just one game. I bought the Switch because there are other games that I like too. Xenoblade, Project Octopath, Disgaea V, SMT, plus Nintendo games. I liked how Japanese games are going to support the system and I also love handhelds.
I think it also will depend how much money you have. For some people $300 is not that much.. for others is a lot of money.
In my case I am loving the little system. It was worth getting the system for me. Speaking of Zelda this game is a masterpiece lol. If you have already a Wii U I would recommend getting it ASAP or you could just wait and see how strong the game library will be lol. Zelda will always be there."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@Grundle_85 @Vicdsnew my thing is whether you get wii u or switch you will surely enjoy something else.  i think zelda is great but idk if any game can justify a $350 pricetag
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@Vicdsnew yeah I got zelda and nier and getting mass effect the end of the month so my gaming schedule is packed! i will def play horizon and sometimes i second guessed myself for opting for zelda over it but the more time goes on I believe i made the right decision. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	Better late than never IGN?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@CLravioli  not exactly like the gaming community is clamoring all over themselves for immediate reviews of every PSVR game on every gaming site?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@thepenismightier @CLravioli The PSVR community is. You should check out the reddit page sometime. Everyone over there is amped for any and every new game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@JazGalaxy @thepenismightier @CLravioli Yeah... thats kinda like saying IGN don't need to review Switch games quickly, since only Switch people would be interested in them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@FortescueHaljournon @JazGalaxy @thepenismightier @CLravioli  not really - switch is a new thing with lots of buzz, tv commercials, and interest right now (both positive and negative).  PSVR has turned into what seems to be a tiny little niche market of a relatively tiny portion of the PS4 user-base, let alone the entire base of all gamers.  The amount of talk/buzz around it outside of dedicated sites/forums seems to be very close to zero. I see the units sit unsold on store shelves all around me and even all the haters around here seem to have grown bored by it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@thepenismightier @FortescueHaljournon @JazGalaxy @CLravioli Please do tell me where these stores are that have units, since according to many on the PSVR Facebook groups there are still stock shortages and can be hard to find available.  People are paying well over retail just to buy a secondhand version.  Sony have also announced that it has sold over 1 million units already.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"@FortescueHaljournon @thepenismightier @JazGalaxy @CLravioli  I live in the SF bay area and I noticed my local Target store got 2 PSVRs in stock about 2 weeks ago. I was just there a few hours ago and there were still 2 there (no way to know if they were the same 2 as before though). I admit I didn't physically see the PSVRs at my local ToysRUs store, but a co-worker of mine said he saw them there also around 1-2 weeks ago.
My local target is 98% cleaned out of everything switch related, down to only the most obscure accessories still on the shelves, so it's not like it's some weird store that gamers never go to.

Hell, they're in stock on amazon, which makes me really wonder about people paying over retail for a 2nd hand one..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@thepenismightier @FortescueHaljournon @JazGalaxy @CLravioli Well cheers for confirming, and will definitely mention that to the group.  I think most of those who have been searching are in the UK, so perhaps shipping costs are prohibitive for them... moreso than ebay tax! ;-)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	@FortescueHaljournon @thepenismightier @JazGalaxy @CLravioli cheers back! :)   Also, to be clear, I'm talking about the psvr by itself, not the bundle which I have never actually seen on an y store shelf, but I do see it tempting me on US amazon...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	"@thepenismightier @FortescueHaljournon @JazGalaxy @CLravioli I highly recommend doing so... but beware that some people don't like it at all, while others can no longer play normal games! (I am in the latter group).
The bundle is great, but the PS3 Move controllers do work if you can find them elsewhere."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/09/psychonauts-in-the-rhombus-of-ruin-review	Dangling carrot element. Lol.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/ghost-recon-wildlands-review	In the middle of this game now. It's enjoyable enough, but feels like it could have been something special with more time in development and a lot more polish. The open world is great, but mission design could have used a lot more work.

Still, game is really awesome. Especially after watching S1 of Narcos"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/ghost-recon-wildlands-review	This game sucks! Period.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/ghost-recon-wildlands-review	"I see a few people bitching about repetition... frankly that's just about every game in the world Kill,attack,go to,save, protect so on so forth for me it's expected with every game. What I'm amazed at is the person who did the review for this game didn't bother to go in depth of the story its self and is not the same person who did the review for GRFS and gave this game a 7.9? More so this title deseves a 9.0 or 9.2. From the score of Ghost Recon Future Soldier of a 8.5 to me this review is bias and possibly overlooked. For what this game GRWL is intend for it's well praised for now. I personally think this the game could use some improvements overall. I've played this game solo beat it in less than 4 days lvl 30 with SP and got my Platnum Trophy. For me it's a solid 9.0 maybe a 8.8. I could care less about the Co-op option for me it's not needed to score this title. This game does play tacticly when your not playing on any difficulty other than extreme with low gamma,Brightness,and contrast with Zero visuals and no hud which yes makes the game hard as Fuck! It's a Great way to play only on a local connection not connection to some dude states away or a country even. But if you are a casual gamer then your option is just that... but if you take gaming to another level, no not MLG level because they half-ass saw a COD stream wasn't impressed. The point is if your are not nit picky about everything...Well you don't play games to score them... And ideally everyone has different things they like in a game. This title however, IMO hit all the spots where it counts and what I look for is a successful title and to keep me playing and enjoying it that's props. Note: Keeping in mind this game just released and there has been a few updates already and no additional content aside from Ubisoft club content. No DLCs or expansions as of yet from the SP but Ubisoft club has The ""Conspiracy DLC"" has been there for a bit. So this score and review is fairly irrelevant for the time being. That said, Game on!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/ghost-recon-wildlands-review	Man the AI in this game is terrble, civilians run me over, the teammates are stupid. I get stuck in between rocks. Still glitchy needs updates badly.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/ghost-recon-wildlands-review	"Trouble with the - ""this game is fun in co op with your friends"" is almost any game can be fun with your mates, it's with your mates. I've played plenty of bad games with mates and had a right laugh. It's no excuse for this shell of a ghost recon game. Where's the Tom Clancy story, wheres the tactical use of squads. Frankly the AI squad mates being for revives and a cheap ability kills is pathetic.

A massive world where you have to engage tactics and think about missions and engagements? A kind of Arma experience but with more accessibility and smooth presentation? That's what this game could have been if they actually wanted a Ghost recon open world game. What we got was Ubi open world standard design with Ghost recons husk draped over. From an old recon fan, it makes me sad how far the series sank."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/08/ghost-recon-wildlands-review	Finally a great co-op game. So many weapons! Huge maps. So far so good.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	Was I supposed to get all this free if I already own shovel knight?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Gobucks2015 On Switch when you buy Treasure Trove it includes the original game. Treasure Trove is not available on other consoles yet.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Gobucks2015 Yeah it will upgrade with the update. All versions are becoming Treasure Trove
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	Ori and the Blind Forest is the best platformer I have ever played. I just have not found time to play this title yet? Looks good
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Legend_of_Link27 Sounds like you have not played many platformer games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@BERT0503 @Legend_of_Link27 Come on Ori was a good game. Why the hate
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Legend_of_Link27 @BERT0503 It was good. Not great. Overrated since Xbox One barely has platformers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	I've never made time to play either this or Binding of Isaac, so I figure I'll be set for games for a while with my Switch (once I find one), thanks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	Great Pack (Spectre Knights Great).  If you have other 2 you can just buy Spectra on its own (which is great).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	I just want to check before I flop down money on this. It's the same stages, just with different character mechanics and a different story?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	Read the fucking review are you kidding me
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Maxsk8g lol well that was an angry response. The stages in the review look identical to the ones in original shovel knight just with minor changes to play off the new knight's abilities. I'm not interested in rebuying the game if that's all it is.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	Is this only available on switch right now?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@kik3mike Yes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	OMG, I feel so stupid. All this time I thought Treasure Trove was the name of a new Treasure Knight campaign. I thought it was really weird that they were releasing the Spectre Knight campaign and the Treasure Knight campaign at the same time. Derp. Treasure Trove is just a compilation of the 3 campaigns.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Zaxtur64 Compilation of 4 campaigns actually, the 4th one will be free once it comes out for treasure trove owners.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Fallis91 @Zaxtur64 plus their bringing out a multiplayer shovel too!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	I wanted to ask, is Treasure Trove different from the base Shovel Knight game?. Also is Specter of Torment a standalone expansion or do we need to get Shovel Knight before it?.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@pyrotechnics Treasure Trove is like a game of the year edition. It is the original game plus the two new expansions.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@BossFighter @pyrotechnics Ahh that's cool, means i will only need to get Treasure Trove, thanks man. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@pyrotechnics @BossFighter Yeah, also the 4th campaign that will come out will be free for treasure trove owners.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@Fallis91 @pyrotechnics @BossFighter That's nice, thanks!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	"Can someone answer me something.... I've never played Shovel Knight but I really really want to. In fact, I bought it like last year but I haven't had the time to play it, but I will soon. The thing is, I'm confused about all the different names I've been reading lately. I think the version I downloaded on my Wii U only says ""Shovel Knight"", but I've been reading names like Shovel Knight: Something something (sorry, I don't remember the names), or Shovel Knight: Something else, and now I'm seeintg Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove. Are all of these sequels or what? Should I buy all of them? "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@let-it-burn  The WiiU should have the original and plague knight.  They are good at giving DLC for no extra cost.  I am not sure if this latest expansion is Switch exclusive, a free download or paid DLC.  After reading more, in April you will be able to have everything for free if you bought it already. So enjoy!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	"@let-it-burn If you bought it on on Wii U, you'll get all the expansions. On current-gen consoles, they're releasing each expansion separately or all of them together (like a Season Pass) as ""Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove""."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@BangThenBang @let-it-burn But are these standalone expansion or do we need to own the base Shovel Knight game on Switch?.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	"@pyrotechnics @BangThenBang @let-it-burn If you buy Treasure Trove, you get the original base game, the plague knight DLC, the Spectre Knight DLC, and when the Treasure Knight DLC comes out you get it for free. 

If you only buy Spectre of Torment, You only get that game standalone and nothing else."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@pyrotechnics @BangThenBang @let-it-burn The expansions are playable by themselves.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	@BangThenBang @pyrotechnics @let-it-burn Ahh so i can even buy Specter of Torment and play it, thanks dude.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/shovel-knight-treasure-trove-review	Shovel Knight is hella fun, I bought it on sale for the Wii U last week.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	i like this guy too but i must say he botched this review. nintendo switch is an amazing and unprecedented console. aside from top tier graphics that ps4 and other consoles may have an edge with, games like nba 2k are going to be full featured on switch, and the endless exclusive titles offered by nintendo, plus the overall customization that the hardware offers make this console perfect for more reasons than any other console can list. i can play a game on my big screen tv at home, then take it on the go seamlessly in hand-held mode, and then end up at a friends house, split the device up to have two separate ( and perfectly working from my experience) controllers and play mario kart with a friend, no other console can even relate, and that alone is worth $300.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	This console is a joke. Selling a half finished product a year before its online services are operational is like selling a cellphone without cell towers. This 300 dollar pile of Zelda will be outdated on stone age tech before it even becomes operational.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	Some interesting thoughts on the Switch and Nintendo's recent consoles overall: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zh1EsE2HVOA
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	"Seductive, but full of planned obsolescence and unnecessary costs
So, I made a video on why and how I think the Nintendo Switch should be redesigned. 

DISCLAIMER: I have not purchased the Nintendo Switch. But I have seen many (dumb) issues with its design, which is why I flatly won’t buy it. For instance:
Planned Obsolescence
One of the most iconic consumer complaints about this product is that its kickstand is flimsy and poorly angled. Another issue is that the touchscreen is made of plastic, which gets scratched easily by the dock. Speaking of which, it’s hollow and therefore is likely to break if you drop it. Nyko has made an alternative hyper-portable docking kit, which you can check out here:
https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/06/nintendo-switchs-dumb-dock-gets-beaten-by-hyper-portable-nyko-option/
Unnecessary Costs
First, the dock. It covers the entire console when you slide it in. There's no reason for it to be this unnecessarily huge. Which, again, the Nyko dock illustrates. It’s RIDICULOUS. All of it. Second, the touchscreen. 1) It doesn't need to be as big as it is. 2) Nowadays, Nintendo consoles usually have touchscreen, cameras, accelerometers, gyro controls. But might you be holding something in your hand or have something in your pocket that has all these features + more? I'm pretty sure you get where I'm going with this. But just in case you don't, it's your mobile phone or PDA."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	Fired for giving it a poor review. Nintendo then hires the guy that gives their games 10/10s. There is no such thing as coincidences.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	I honestly think it should be 9.5. Re-review plz?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	Lol I'm excited for the inevitable re-review. Especially since this editor was fired. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	How did he get fired?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/nintendo-switch-review	 This system is only as good as it's games... and It's only looking up from here.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	Great game. The more you play, the more you like it. I am a huge fan of F-zero. Never cared much for Wiepout but I owe them all. The game play seems to be better on the Nintendo Switch version. I really like having this game on the go. Highly recommended! I would love to see F-zero for the Switch or 3ds. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	"This is frankly really poor. It's technically impressive, but like all Shin'en games, the gameplay is lacking. Course design is abysmal, with so many odd and irritating choices.
Stick to F-Zero or Wipeout."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	"Great game. While obviously not as good as F-Zero or Wipeout, it's an excellent alternative. The only quibble is the Hero mode trying to emulate F-Zero doesn't emulate it well enough. Orbs should be concentrated in only one or two areas of the circuit to act as a proper recharge like F-Zero does, and the booster pads should become booster arrows and be single phase. Then you potentially have F-Zero.

I agree about obstacles on the track. It's a ridiculous idea in such a game, and even F-Zero made this mistake, thanks the involvement of dopey Sega, with GX on the Gamecube. F-Zero is about holding speed as much as possible, not avoiding stuff."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	@modeVII I'm really on the fence with this one. Worth the price? $30 CAD.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	@Coop3r187 @modeVII I bought it a couple days ago. Worth EVERY penny. The asking price is actually probably a little low. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	@cgatto @Coop3r187 @modeVII Definitely!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	Just started this today, seems pretty fun so far.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	I had to search IGN to find this review and upon doing so I found out that Fast Racing Neo, this game's predecessor, got a higher score. I reconfirmed that on opencritic as well. smh
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	congrats Nintendo you reach the graphics capability of a game that came out in 2008 sugoi!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	Just bought this game after finishing zelda and I actually really like it. I think the review is spot on.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	"""Local online multiplayer is also available, but each player needs to own a copy of the game."" That's the biggest horse shit I've ever heard."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	"You can still do up to 4 players on the same system. If you want to link multiple systems up (for up to 8 players), each needs a copy.
It's not that surprising."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	"@MinimumWageNinja  ""LOCAL ONLINE multiplayer."" Go back to kindergarten. Learn how to read. Of course LOCAL ONLINE (multi-console) multiplayer needs multiple cartridges. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	"@sixty4bit @MinimumWageNinja  Actually, it's probably a bit inbetween.  I suspect the reviewer meant ""Local Wi-Fi multiplayer"".  Many games allow you to put 2+ Switches near each other and play over Wi-Fi without an online connection.  Going a step further, some games will let you do this with only one copy of the game.  In this case, the other Switches without the game will copy the necessary files from Switch with the game.  Typically this is reduced multiplayer functionality, but still neat.  

I suspect in this case the reviewer is saying that you can play locally (peer 2 peer) over Wi-Fi, but each Switch needs a full copy of the game.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	"@sixty4bit @MinimumWageNinja Oh I'm sorry, I couldn't read the statement of ""multi-console"" you magically added to the statement. Local online multiplayer, like Mario Kart, is where you have split-screen online play with one purchase of the game. Multi-console I can understand, but wasn't specified."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review	its a shit version of Wipeout HD
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	It's a cool game, I even like the story mode, but $50?! They're gonna have to lower the price if I'll be able to afford to spend money! Maybe $10 or even $30 at the absolute most. I could buy Legend of Zelda Breath Of The Wild with that cash!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	What does R even stand for? Retch?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	"@NintenDave1 Konami said it symbolizes ""Returns and Reborn because this game is such a homage to SNES and SB3. But it also means Rangers, to represent the diverse and colorful group of Bomberman characters who patrol the galaxy."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	Is everyone on here going to ignore the big fat KONAMI on the boxart and blame Nintendo for the $50 pricetag?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	@BRAINFOX Konami is not what it used to be...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	50$ !? For Bomberman!?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	@Chronmeister Now you know how I feel about paying $50 for a remaster on Xbox One and PS4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	I wish this was a remaster of a good bomberman game instead of a bare bones cash grab. At least remasters are generally good games made better rather than a shit game that costs 5X what it should.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	@chuchumyrocket It has a single player and multiplayer. Not bad at all. Games like Quantum Break or The Order cost $60 at launch and last about 10 hours.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	 every time i see this i ponder why didnt they just do bomberman 64.......
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	@sgtdwill11 Konami thought they could do better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	 OH, Bomberman isn't a good $50 investment but 1-2 Switch is I guess, since IGN gave it a better score?   How much meth is IGN on right now?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	@AngeredFox  stop reaching
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	Had fun with this but defo not worth $50.  Its a $10 - $15 game.  They are milking the fact not many games so cashing in early in 3 - 6 months this will be $20 tops. 1 2 switch gets boring after a few get togethers.  But Zelda making up for both these average titles.  Enjoying Blaster Master and Shovel knight more lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	It's a very hard mission, do a Bomberman game good as Saturn Bomberman, a truly masterpiece, and with that amazing soundtrack,  it's near to impossible, and Nintendo should look for the past, to make better games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	@fernando37 Konami developed the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	 dang, less than 1-2 Switch? :( Guess I'll wait for it to hit the bargain bin. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	@sixty4bit  Don't let that discourage you. It's still Bomberman, which is ALOT of fun with friends, and even online
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/super-bomberman-r-review	No thanks. Never really dug Bomberman anyway, but still disappointed.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	@RAVEN_LUNATIK Really. Really, really really.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	@RAVEN_LUNATIK it's actually a really good puzzle game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	@RAVEN_LUNATIK I know what you mean. Maybe they should have given it a 9 out of 10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	After watching some videos, this looked like a boring kiddy game, but when I actually played it multiplayer, I realized seriously how much fun it was. Definitely a must-have party game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	@exactspace Yup!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	 It's the Portal 2 Co-op for 2017. This will destroy your relationships. It's a lot of fun, guys. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	Don't let some of the trolls below fool you, this is a really fun game. Not as fun to play by yourself, but if you have company over it is a real treat and will make everyone smile. Simple, yet creative style, and the characters make great facial expressions as they interact with the environment. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	Check out my YouTube channel if you are looking for Snipperclips gameplay! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ln9t6U6ctHc&t=25s

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	@residentevilfan09  Thankfully there's a free demo for it and it's pretty fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	Love the little facial expressions on the characters, makes me smile.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/snipperclips-cut-it-out-together-review	This game is a ton of fun to play with my girlfriend and her son. When my friends come over we usually play quirky or quick multiplayer games like rocket league and starwahl. This one is definitely being added to the list!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	So forgive me for my ignorance as i just started this game last night. I got through the the first hour or so and died at the second boss i believe (the one who took down 9S). After that, it immediately took me back to the beginning of the game with the opening flight sequence. Is that supposed to happen? If so, when can you save your progress? Thank you. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	"I don't believe that this review did it justice - felt like any other generic review written just to get people to read. This is definitely game of the year. I found this review to be the most honest and accurate so far: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-NiyfG8Ctbo

10/10 for me"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	This game is worth far more than 8.9..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	@Drazan it's certainly a better game than horizon zero dawn... didnt that game get like a 9.5? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	"So, I freaking love this game, and played all the way through, and I can definitely say this game, on the surface level, is absolutely a 9/10 game.
But it's the best 9/10 game you can possibly get, and way better than some ""perfect"" games.
It's flawed, but it's art. This is a game that absolutely needs to be played by everyone who loves video games. 

Therefore, 10/freaking 10."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	I played Nier last night for like 20 mins and I must say, holding a controller never felt so good. It's very responsive and smooth. Makes me wonder why most games can't be like this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	i hope they make a new game with the same characters... that's all I'm going to say 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	And there is someone who doesnt understand the true beauty of this game, and gives it a 8.9/10. Srsly if u cant get the beauty and true meaning of a game, dont rate games. This game would beat Zelda or Persona 5 or any other game this year or past years, easily. And not just with the soundtrack or graphics, also with the story telling, the charakter design and the overall level of thought that went in every second of this game! This is true beauty and like most reviewer you cant get this beauty, idk if you dont want to see it or you are just to blind, but this game is a masterpiece, and i know that if this game wont get a mention in history, i dont want to live on this god dam universe anymore!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	@HeyImTim dude, i love this game too but relax. nothing wrong with an 8.9.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	@Antonov88 @HeyImTim Seems like Antonov hasn't played the ending E. After all my years of gaming, this game was excellent one of the tops aside the excelent music....but ending E man......that essential moment with shared sacrificies of other gamers that is the pinnacle of gaming the most original idea i've seen ever.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	@Tyosn @Antonov88 @HeyImTim Currently on my second play through. Such an amazing game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	@Antonov88 @Tyosn @HeyImTim i was thinking of playing it again too. it is def a better game than horizon. that's for sure
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	"@HeyImTim opinions. just how i don't see how people obsess over horizon and hate mass effect. i think the new mass effect is better than horizon. 

but i also think nier is better than horizon too. so is resident evil 7 

it's all opinions . I'm sure nobody would agree with me on mass effect. i seriously would rate Andromeda in the high 8s "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	@HeyImTim  Somebody bought this for me bu I haven't played it yet. Your comment makes me want to drop everything and play it right now. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	By the way, IGN, why did you replace the Disqus social networking service with your IGN social networking service (which resembles Livefyre)?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	"There were a lot of great games this year so far, but Nier Automata is easily my GOTY. It's truly one of the few games that uplifts the medium itself and touches your very soul at the same time.
A masterpiece in story telling, game design and visual and aural detail, right down to the sublime soundtrack.
The review reads as if the combat and some of the gimmicks are the stars of the game, which could not be further from the truth."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/06/nier-automata-review	I'm glad the PS4 is finally getting some really good exclusives... my PS4 was collecting dust for a while until the influx of great games that started to come in late 2015. It'll likely be a while before I play this, as I'm still hooked on Zelda: BotW, and I'm starting to get burnt out on open-world, hack/slash, RPG-esque, adventure games (also recently beat Horizon: Zero Dawn).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	" Beat the game just shy at 16 percent. I;ve heard a lot of crying over the pop in rate, but I played the majority of the game in handheld mode, so i can forgive that issue. 

my only complaint might be in the form of Gannon. SPOILER-ISH 





there are two parts/battles, like most Zelda games. in this case, bug Ganon takes to long and Pig Ganon is WAAAAAAAY to easy. an easier fight with the first version and a harder fight with the second version would have worked wonders."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	Way overrated game. Played a few days and I'm bored. Weapons are done after making 2 or 3 hits on enemies, making combat a chore. Graphics are passable at best but the pop-in that occurs when descending from the air is pretty game breaking.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	I liked the one on N64 better. I feel this version has too much of a cartoon feel does anyone else agree?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	This will Age better. If you go back, to Ocarina of Time, or Majoras mask, they look like shit, but Windwaker is still easy on the eyes
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@mamike12344 I will agree that Ocarina of Time is still the best Zelda game ever made.... I didn't feel that BOTW was to cartoony.... I just hated what they did with the dungeons.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	This is one of the rare times I actually agree with a game being rated a 10. It truly is a masterpiece and a work of art.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	Did anyone else find ganon to be a huge letdown?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@EGGBUCKETPOO  I think you're a huge letdown
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	I am with 20 hours of game, I just can't stop playing it. Normally a 20 hours game is long enough, but this one just don't let you get bored. Let's see if it keeps me the same way until the end of the game. It is the only game worth to have a Switch up to now, and I could have it in the Wii U, but... it is great. Just don't forget to buy a pro controller, the joy cons are terrible.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	I recently made the choice to get a switch and BOTW. Simply blown away, this is def game of the year IMO. If you have doubts, just get it and you'll be amazed at how good it really is. I wish more games were developed this well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	Ummmmmm no this game is way over rated how can you call this a 10/10 it has one of the worse voice acting ever. Persona 5 deserves a 10/10 this game really isn't all that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@mannyakazeek360 hey people, look at this chump over here. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@mannyakazeek360  Ya no, just no!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@mannyakazeek360 Well I do agree it has some issues like bad controller if using the joy con and if you compare to the current gen graphics it stands low, however the history is great, it is the first time a Zelda with lots of speech. The sound could be better i think, make a stronger sound. Maybe a 9.5/10 would be perfect. But maybe when I get further in the game I may love or hate it more.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	Just started this a few days ago. About 12 hours in now. It's ok. Super repetitive enemies, terrible graphics, awful framerate, incredibly boring side quests, forgettable NPCs. It's ok, I'd give it about a 7.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@Poatate_Tha_Grate IGN holds Nintendo's nuts. I agree, it's absolutely nothing special. Zelda games are a blur of one game repeating, honestly. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@Poatate_Tha_Grate Sounds more of the case that you started the game with a certain bias and now feel the need to express that bias publicly. Game is great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	I'm on the opposite end of the aruement. After Breath of the Wild, I played Persona 5, which I just finished, then picked up Horizon and ME: Andromeda. I feel like Zelda has killed open world games for me because I'm constantly stopped by invisible walls. It makes both of these games feel linear. Sure I'm enjoying them, but I can't help but notice the lack of freedom
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	@Wrestlingmidget07 after BOTW and TW3 I'm not sure I can enjoy an RPG ever again haha
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	"@Poatate_Tha_Grate Art >>>>>>>>>>>> Graphics

This game will not date"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	"@Poatate_Tha_Grate I'm sorry I'll admit to being a fanboy if you admit to being a hater. There is no possible way you are playing this game and not loving it unless your heart is so full of hate there's no room for the love of this game. You just gotta be ""that guy"". Congrats, you're that guy, the one who slags on and hates the thing that everyone universally agrees is excellent because you need to stand out side the greater opinion and be jaded and crap all over something I seriously doubt you ever played and be the single dissenting voice.But the thing is? Everybody fucking HATES that guy. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	I would definitely add this to the list of games that everyone who calls themselves a gamer NEEDS to play. Along with Ocarina of Time, Portal AND Portal 2, some sort of Mario game (I don't know which one), Street Fighter II, and maybe skyrim.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review	"@HeroOfTime500 Well I would replace OoT by BotW, it hasn't aged that well imo. I've played OoT on 3DS and didn't enjoy it that much. 
Portal 2, Super Mario World (or Galaxy 2 or eventually Odyssey I suppose) are great choices. 
Skyrim/Oblivion or Witcher 3 I suppose, then maybe I would add GTA V"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/just-dance-2017-review	Well of course it doesn't teach anything... it's not a dance studio... where people go to practice how to dance... this is just a game to have you jump around and maybe lose some weight... or play at a party... if you though you was going to learn something... then that was your mistake... not the games...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/just-dance-2017-review	One day it will be discovered that the Just Dance games track nothing more than the fact that you are present. All points are completely random.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	Mario Party 11 will definitely be better when it gets announced at E3 and will probably offer likes 1000x more than this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	"I'm gonna go ahead and call this review ignorant as hell. Reviewing a game like 1-2 Switch as if it's some award winning mega game. It's a bizarre, stupid, fun party game. It's awkward and odd and that's what makes it original. I read a review recently for the new Beauty & The Beast movie where the reviewer called the pieces in the Beast's house, that come to life (you know like the candlestick, the teapot and shit), they called those ""hammy & campy"". So, let me get this right.....a F'n candlestick talking, walking, dancing and singing is campy? Really? Shocking. Of course it is. Made the review sound ignorant and flat out stupid. Much like this review of 1-2 Switch. It ain't the second coming of Fallout, it's a ridiculous party game......we've played it a bunch and it's fun. Gets us out of our comfort zone and acting goofy and not caring about it. Then when you get just adults together and add beverages, it's even sillier, stupid fun. Crap review."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	This is garbage. This should be a 2.0 AWFUL. Just watch Angry Joe review. It's not responsive in many of the games and the only fun game is that jerking off ..milking game. 50+ bucks?! WTF!!! Oh hell no. Just give it some time, you'll find these for 5 bucks in the junk bin at Target or something
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	I have a 5 year old daughter and have just bought this managed to get it for £17 off eBay, sure she will love it!... I've just completed Zelda so it's something to play just for a laugh...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	@sammygamerman It's silly but fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	People are being really harsh on this game, I mean it's gotten all around okayish reviews, and I'm looking forward to picking this up when the price drops. I like these party games, like Nintendoland. Just because you disagree with a review doesn't mean the reviewer was paid to give that score, otherwise they would have given it... well higher than a 6.8 aththe very least.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	@Bigyellow24 You clearly didn't fucking see people actually play this game, because if you did, you'd know that the reviews are a goddamned lie. Scores are inflated. This game is a 2-3/10. I'm not fucking kidding. Go watch people play it. It is absolute garbage.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	"I've seen it been played. I've seen it on pbg gameplay, other YouTube channels, those... God awful advertisements. It looks like a fun game, but not exactly a good ""video"" game. But I don't see that as a bad thing. This game focuses on nothing but crazy, varied gameplay when so many games today are just barely interactive movies (cough*Mafia 3*cough), and even if not all the games look good (""Anyone up for a round of baby?"" Said no one), the majority of the game looks like an okay game for my friends and I. Still, $50 is too much, I'll just get bomberman R."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	I was tempted to buy this game, purely because it showcases the HD rumble... guess I'll wait for Nintendo to do something more with it...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/1-2-switch-review	6.8 = a shallow, gimmicky game.. wow.. Any questions remaining how powerful Nintendo remains over the reviews and fair use market? There is no such thing as an independent review of a Nintendo product. This is completely debilitating. How can this be defended? Nintendo is supposed to be gamer friendly. For context and why this is a problem we see that IGN gave Battleborn a 7.1 noting that is was 'repetitive'. So in the Nintendo controlled IGN universe a 7.1 is repetitive but a 6.8 is merely shallow and gimmicky?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	Guess I'm just one of those weirdos who likes killing the robot dinosaurs and reading hours of interactive text... Of course I listen to audio books while driving and doing chores. I'm coming in late (just got a PS4) but this is well worth my $30. I've paid $60 for games I couldn't stand for more than 1 hour.

I'll just donwload another steven king audiobook"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	This game looks way too dated for me. But if people are enjoying it then it's a good thing it was made. Gotta love the diversity of games. Gamers need to get along and enjoy games more instead of always arguing. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	 Based on the review, I wonder if I'd be better off buying the TTRPG Numenera rulebooks, and just enjoying them for their great art and lore. Or, even PLAYING it with friends who like table top game nights.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	"Funny how easily ""turn based"" and ""disappointing"" fit easily together in one sentence.  I haven't been able to stomach turn based combat without dying of boredom in any game except XCOM in the last 10 years.  Build an interesting combat system or just don't have combat.  It doesn't have to be real time twitch, but it can't be Diablo point and click to win RTS style and it can't be this.  I just can't get through these giant RPGs anymore when so much time is spent in filler content disguised as a battle."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	IGN needs a new rating scale. This is CLEARLY an 8.9 not an 8.8. If it was fractional, I'd go with 8.87 but it feels like the game is being lessened somehow by such a huge disparity. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	@Ekras for most accuracy rate it in potatoes
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	Was going to get this on PS4 but it's almost $20 more than on Xbox One (in Canada). Xbox it is but that's ridiculous.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	@ponyboy30 Give it a few weeks, these type of games drop in price fast. It is worth getting but be patient and wait. It also gives them time to fix the many issues on PS. Or get on Xbox there is not much of a difference in quality with the two in this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	Yeah I already took the plunge. I don't dislike Xbox or anything, I just typically buy RPGs on PS4 by default. Just surprises by the price difference. Even Lego Worlds is $10 more.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	"As much as I like the game, and do agree that the writing is great. The fact that Inxile misled and hid the fact that they abandoned most of the Stretch goals and even many of the core promises to KS supporters... they seem to be let off of this quite a bit.

Having 3 classes being one the ones that annoyed me the most, they lied bout this many times. Just for a hint there is 50+foci in the PnP game, and the 3 picked for T:ToN are the most basic of these 50+."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	@DarkChrisHour  Combat in this game is so challenging and the fact is you don't get more rewards for battling compared to talking yourself out of fight, there is little incentive to pick anything else other than a Nano.  The game isn't designed to be like Baldur's Gate or Pillars of Eternity.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	I think this is repost. I feel like you guys reviewed this way sooner than any other major site? Usually it's the other way around :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	Is this a physical game, or digital? I wish they would make that clear in the reviews.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/torment-tides-of-numenera-review	@NintenDave1 Both, you can find it physical in stores such as Game, or digital in Steam and console networks.

Graphics: one of the better looking RTS i have seen, especially on a console and even better on pc.Cut scenes are gorgeous

Gameplay: to make an rts work on a console is tough, but they do it well. Theres alot of variety as far as gameplay modes go.

Sound : awesome on my 4k tv, no soundbar.

Most of all, it has quick (or long) matches and its just pure fun regardless of what universe its set in, halo or otherwise. I really wanted to hate this game so i would bail and go back to ps4 but honestly I dont. Its one of the reasons im glad i switched."

Don't listen to reviewer, whoever Dan Stapleton is???  Never heard of him!!!   8.5 is what I give it!  Lots of fun multiplayer modes, decent single player and  wicked cinematics.   Not for everyone, but certainly worth buying.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/halo-wars-2-review	of course this have to be the score in this Sony's page, for me it's a super game with 8.5 minimum, I'm enjoying it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/halo-wars-2-review	So far, the first one was much better imo.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	"""...but the too-easy combat still gets very repetitive."" So if that's your case/argument for the review, how is it that all these cut and paste Call of Dooty games seem to continuously get great reviews? I think you may be selling this game a little short, even considering this is basically yet another reskinned Dynasty Warriors game. Sure all the Dynasty Warrirors games are essentially the same thing reskinned, but so are all the COD games, EA sports games, and basically anything EA and Activision churn out every year, yet they seem to get added points for some reason."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	Yeah but I think the point is it's just a two button system in a hack and slash so you do the same attack combo over and over cause it's OP. As a fan of Dynasty Warriors though I couldn't care less. Though I can see why it would lower the appeal. COD is an FPS (completely different style of game) and there isn't much to an FPS game. though they do change some things, but when making a sequel it makes sense you would keep the main gameplay aspects otherwise why even make a sequel you already made a new game? People love to hate on COD or battlefield but the games sell and a lot of people love those series. It's like comparing apples to oranges.

This crap review would have been better with the simple tag line: If you like Musou games, get it. If you don't, don't bother. The end.""

I find most shooters to be incredibly boring and repetitive, just point and click basically with the sights or reticle. However that's my personal opinion and not a valid criticism of those games. Using the ""repetitive"" excuse in reviews is stupid. All games are essentially repetitive but it's up to the gamer which genre they can enjoy the repetitiveness in."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	@RufioJ The DW and DW-spin off series is repetitive.  And trying to bring BF/CoD gameplay into comparison won't make DW less repetitive than it is. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	Might buy this on GP
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	I know it's gonna be a mindless hack and slash but damn, I'm really happy that this is out.  I've been waiting since the 90s for Berserk to follow up with that series, that ending had me questioning life...  Stoked that this series is revived all around!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	@BASSPHUQ Did you not play Sword of the Berserk on Dreamcast?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	@kraussndhouse @BASSPHUQ I have it actually, I bought a dreamcast just for that game.  I never beat it though lol I got stuck on this part where something is chasing you and haven't played it since.  Thanks for the reply, this reminds me to go back and play it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	@BASSPHUQ @kraussndhouse one hit kill vines near the end. Its super frustrating because if you lose your lives it makes you fight a boss that is just before it all over again. Its a pain, worst part of the game by far. The zodd fight is so friggin great though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	Give Berserk to From software or something, what a sad developer to give it to like Koei. The berserk franchise doesnt deserve a treatment like this Dynasty Warriors games are like fun for 20 minutes then you realize you wasted your money.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	Seems to be even more dull, easy and repetitive than I predicted which is a shame. As a massive Berserk fan, I really wanted to get this, but I know I won't enjoy it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	You know who I'd like to see make a Berserk game?  Keiji Inafune, as long as he brings along the rest of the Soul Sacrifice team with him.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	As repetitive as the gameplay is, it never gets old running through hundreds of enemies as Guts!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	@Kinggoken That's what I was thinking, I know what I'm getting myself into when I play a game like this.  I'm gonna pick this up once it hits the bargain bin, which probably won't take too long.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	If this game added one extra button to the combo system, made the enemies attacks more frequent and took its time telling the story a little more it would have been every long time Berserk fans dream
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	A berserk game with the gameplay of For Honor would be a wet dream.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	"@defs i agree with all but ""take more time telling the story"", i mean seriously, there are stages that have 6 anime cutscenes!, the story is very well told, i don't think it should have been any longer."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	@jeremycards yeah but it drops off towards the end... Which is where the manga REALLY gets interesting. If they would have taken the time and let us play through Griffith's evolution and everything else it would have been epic
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/21/berserk-and-the-band-of-the-hawk-review	@defs Ah, probably, i just got past the Golden Age. My guess is that they don't take as much time because they don't have the cutscenes from the movies after that point =/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	The best PS4 game to date......
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	This game got put on the back burner after BOTW came out, but I picked it back up and I'm glad I did.  40 hours into it and it's incredible.  To me this is THE reason to own a PS4.  Hard to believe the studio that is responsible for Killzone made such a masterpiece. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	To put how good the game's story is into perspective, if this game was a fictional novel it would no doubt outsell the entire harry potter series.The story is so good that you lose yourself in this magnificent post apocalyptic world.Truth be told I wanted to play this game mainly for the robot-dinosaurs hunting part but man the story was so deep that i totally forgot about the awesome metal destroying action..i give this game a 10/10 ...would like to know more about other regions of the biosphere as in other continents and so on
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	10/10 for me. Best game so far in PS4 aside from Batman Arkham Knight. Any suggestions on what I should buy next? Finaly Fantasy XV (on sale right now $25) or Uncharted 4?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	@jazperson uncharted 4 is a must and so is the rise of the tomb raider
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	@totneschap @jazperson Agreed ! Both games are awesome
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	Made a choice, that choice was to buy Mass Effect over this, boy how wrong I was, this game is so much better than Andromeda, 3 days in and I'm totally hooked, it gives me the same feeling as games like Fallout/Skyrim and Witcher, just so much to do and loads of fun, I wasted so much time on Andromeda when I should have been playing this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	This game was indeed beautiful. Yes it has a whole bunch of lore, but it tends to drag. The story was...well told but it wasn't anything ground-breaking. Combat gets kinda stale after awhile, in some instances I would even say tedious. The main quests and most of the side quests are interesting but they all kinda had the same format. Find something/someone and eventually fight something/someone. I also liked almost every main character in this game except aloy. I thought she was kinda just...an annoying angsty teen with a sense of Justice. All in all it's a solid game it's just needs a little more variety in style when it comes to the open world activities and customization.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	@DDtheGreatest that's because Aloy is an angsty teen with a sense of justice...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	9.3 is BS.  COD gets 9.3s.  HZD has one of the most innovative, complex combat systems in gaming but it gets the same score as some cookie cutter fps.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	I've just started playing the game but I'm not really enjoying it so far. I'm fairly near the beginning but what point does the game really start to pick up?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	@Xethmawt  for me it wasnt that interesting the outcast story, until after the trials when you discover there's more to it. Also pay attention to the data pads and notes and think a bit about them to understand better the world... You'll see that is more than just a weird setting
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	@Maracuxo @Xethmawt Thanks for the reply but I have returned the game for now. I might pick it up again some other time though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	 I heart this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	THIS was the game that made me break down and buy a PS4 - and I LOVED every second of it. I'm mostly an Xbox guy - but I give Sony and Guerilla a standing ovation for this one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	@PlanB77 Aww dude. You need to go play The Last of Us Remastered IMMEDIATELY if you just recently got a PS4. It's one of the best games I've ever played, and I don't even really like zombie games. I think it easily has one of, if not THE best story in a video game ever. Check it out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	I would but I already played and beat it on PS3. I heard good things about Nioh and Uncharted 4, that's my next destination.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	@PlanB77  Ooh LOL ok. As long as you've experienced it then that's all that matters. I personally enjoyed Infamous: Second Son as well, and the entire reason I bought the PS4 in the first place was for Bloodborne. Nioh looks ok but I haven't tried it yet. Never played the Uncharted games either... 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/20/horizon-zero-dawn-review	Dear god yes. I had a PS3 but passed on Last of Us, got the remaster and Jesus it's one helluva emotional roller coaster and 100% fun. Loved every minute.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	"Hey folks, Brandin here. I wrote this review. Here are a few tips for anyone picking up For Honor this weekend that helped me out in the long run.

1. Do the Basic and Advanced Practice tutorials first. They're helpful to get basic mechanics down and they'll net you 3k Steel right off the bat.
2. If you plan on playing a lot in a short amount of time, invest that Steel into a Champion Status buff (it gives you extra XP and Steel for every match, and stacks with other players in the same match.) It pays for itself.
3. Watch the Basic and Advanced Tutorial videos for any heroes you're interested in. Then, pick one you like, and practice that hero. Get good with one before you start bouncing around between heroes. The better you are, the more you win, the more Steel you get to unlock new heroes.
4. Have fun. And thanks for stopping by!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	Game gets worse and worse the more i play it. Ive been kicked more times the ive had a full game, servers are so bad. This games is absolute bullshit. Don't buy it no matter what you do.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	Love For Honor and so much potential as a MMO as far as a battlefield. That being said with how long it takes to join games only to be dropped out is really starting to wear on the game experience that is otherwise awesome.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	I want to love this game, I really do, but this thing is a absolute wreck. Lets start with just trying to get into the damn game, you will most likely load ..load.. then get booted back to home screen. when finally get in a game, youll probably loose connection and get booted to home screen, it will also boot you to your Xbox one home screen and youll have to completely reload the game, if youre not deterred yet and play something else, you will finally get to play an see some action. The combat system is great but flawed. PvP you end up getting teamed up on alot an its next to impossible to do anything. second ppl have figured out how to spam unblockable attacks, repetive moves makes for not much fun. Also, the executions, these are the highlight reel of the game, worst thing about them is, you can be fucking killed while performing one and you cant abort mid way through. now i find this totally bullshit, either make so while doing a execution you cant be hurt which would be preferred or make it so we can atleast fucking abort and defend ourself for fuck sake. Instead youll be all amped cuz your guy is gonna cut his guys head off then whoop some one hits you just before and you end up with no head. trash. and some of the executions can be lengthy, so even if you went one on one some one might arrive just in time to stop you dead. this shit will make you wanna toss the game in the trash or delete it from the hard drive. now for the currency, and leveling system. idk how many years they expected ppl to play this, but you have to go 20 levels to get 1 larger level of which there are 30....what?that means to lvl 1 character out you have to lvl up 600 times!, and it is a slooooow going grind. this is for each character. omfg. I have yet to even see someone lvl 10. and the higher the lvl the better the gear, but good luck keeping interest in one character for 600 lvls with all of your 6 hack an slash moves and 5 different executions, cmon, then all the aesthetics are in the thousands for currency, yet every match you do pays like 50 silver and the orders (challenges) pay a few hundred. wtf where these developers smoking. what a dissapointment.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	"Not a game like it love the combat and I keep goin back to it spite the connection issues.
Most people who don't like the game cant play it and you have to put a lot of time learning the combat."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	This game is a honest piece of shit... servers are so bad. AT&T has better services.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	"Should be called ""No Honor"" the most unbalanced multiplayer game ever..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	Totally shit game , waste of money
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	I'm loving this game! The occasional disconect occurs if the host quits, but I don't encounter many of these. Maybe once every 10-15 matches. Give it a shot, it's a lot of fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	Its a stupid game. Cheapest game ever made and connections sucks a$$. Every day connection loss!! too cheap to get a dedicated server!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/17/for-honor-review	I would get this game if it became cheaper and not always online with Ub$$oft attached to it. Call me old school, I prefer my gaming not to rely on internet. Life is too busy anyways.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	Just started and enjoying myself - whats the DLC like though?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	"@InsidiousAE  As a true SE enthusiast, I may sound biased, but I've loved it - and I don't play any MP. I'm talking about the story campaign missions and the Hitler mission.

The story campaign DLC is solid and each level is just a long as the levels in the main game. Also, taking out Hitler in NUMEROUS ways never, ever gets old. Plus, the added DLC weapons and skins increases the amount to choose from quite a bit.

Today they are releasing more content, including all MP skins for single player! I've been waiting for a ghillie suit in the main campaign since the first SE game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	"i went ahead and bought this game. it looks pretty good... haven't even had a chance to play it yet lol. 

40 dollars isn't bad though. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	" From the comments, it appears SE4 has reeled in a lot of first timers to the series. Welcome all!

I've been on board since the original SE a decade+ ago. I have always been impressed with Rebellion's work on these games, as I am a gamer who much prefers stealth and strategy. I remember emailing Rebellion 10 years ago asking when a SE2 would be coming. There response: We currently have no plans to make anymore Sniper Elite games."" I'm so happy we are now at the 4th one.

To all you newbies out there, I would encourage you to check out the previous games (SE1 graphics ARE dated). All the games are great.

Also, to any PC gaming junkies out there: This game is optimized wonderfully! It's such a great thing to see when so many so-called ""AAA Developers"" can't get PC optimization done correctly.

EDIT: I know the video review says it took him 14 hours. My first playthrough on Normal took my just under 26 hours. If you play this game correctly (as it was designed to be played), you will get much more out of it. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	I've been playing Sniper Elite 4 for a couple weeks now damn near daily and even if I'm not going after Achievements, I don't care, I just LOVE this game!!! When's the next piece of content releasing dammit I WANT MORE!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	@juggalochef2399 what would you rate it 1-10  ?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	@gotobestbuy @juggalochef2399 Honestly a solid 8/10 which makes for a thoroughly enjoyable title. You know what you got coming going in if you've played the prior titles and are totally blown away by how impressive it looks. Then there are the levels that with every consecutive playthrough, affords you new ways to attack and explore and achieve goals set within the level. SO much replayability in this title and a great developer that supports their fans!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	It has been a long time since I have found myself enjoying a game to this extent, and looking forward to the next session with such anticipation, and have each one being completely satisfying. This is mostly playing single player mode so far; haven't tried multiplayer, but I did play a nice 3-hr co-op with my brother (who at one time was rated in the top 10 Halo players). He was thoroughly impressed with the game and the Co-op. SE4 has knocked it out of the park here! So fun! Great mechanics! Deliciously satisfying head (and kidney shots), amazing maps and gorgeous scenery. Usually I don't like 3rd person shooters that much, but this one has shattered that mold and has become my favorite game to play, since Alien Isolation (which I played 4 times through and started another, lol). 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	OK, just picked this up (was NOT on my radar)... and so far this game is what Im looking for. Closest thing to SOCOM in awhile. Different game modes.. crisp controls. Dont get me wrong I love BF1 for its intense game play, but sometimes I like a little more tactics and stealth. This years games are so good with so little time. NIOH/BF1/SE4 are going to keep me busy for awhile.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	@netgear11 I'm thinking about picking it up too
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	@worlddontknow something about this game... cant put my finger on it. Its intense in the sense like RB6 (anticipation) , but then you can sneak up on dudes. You have to be aware of your footstep sounds..boobytraps...this game is pretty dam fun. Didnt get into Uncharted. And GhostRecon at the moment isnt doing anything for me. No PVP
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	"@netgear11 @worlddontknow you sold me. ill probably pick it up tomorrow when i get horizon

The environment with very few exceptions has been beautifully done as well as the stereoscopic sound option. The 3D featured improves all of that even more. This is a game that I know I'll be playing for quite a while. WELL DONE! 9.5
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/13/sniper-elite-4-review	"@maxcomfort I bought it last weekend, and literally spent 3.5 hours on the first level.  I killed every single guy, and less than half were with my rifle.  I only ""went loud"" like once.  I enjoyed every knife kill, every explosion, every body I booby trapped and blew up.

I dunno, I was on the verge of trading this in after a few days, but I'm keeping it for now.  I definitely wouldn't rate this game higher (i know... comparing apples with oranges)  than RE7 though.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	@gsb408 @AceJakk  Also consider Nier.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	@AceJakk @gsb408   Definitely considering Nier no doubt. Nier, Nioh, Horizon, and Yakuza are the games next on my list. Its a case of too many games and not enough time haha. Eventually I will get them all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	 Nioh... sporin...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	Great game! Only problem I had was the online matchmaking. I love to be challenged in these games and sometimes you want a companion which makes it even more fun, but it sucked when I'd summon someone and they'd one-shot the boss which took the fun right out of it. There should've either been a level range for summoning or they should've scaled the visitor's strength. Ended up soloing the last 3 regions. Other than that it was a great game. Although it shouldn't have been rated higher than soulsborne. 8.9/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	@Ryanmn  I agree with your assessment.  I would've preferred to be partnered with someone closer to my level when playing co-op.  Also wouldn't have minded if the bosses received a small stat boost against co-op players.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	"I was really hesitant to get this game, because I was extremely frustrated with Demon Souls, Dark Souls, and Lords of the Fallen. I decided to give the ""soulsborne"" genre (in the form of Nioh) one last chance before giving up.

I'm so glad I did! This game is definitely hard, but I find it way less frustrating than Demon/Dark Souls. Whenever I die, it's because I was being too ""greedy"" (trying to get in an extra hit on a combo) or fighting too sloppily. I haven't died from any technical snafus (aside from my controller running out of battery lol). The hit box is very accurate too! And there are so many RPG-like elements (getting new skills, blessings, reputation, etc.)

If anyone here is wondering whether to get the game or not, I wholeheartedly say YES!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	@PapaJohns Your Pizza's suck!.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	@MiyazakiGOAT @PapaJohns My pizza is the best and I don't afraid anything B-)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	No, Miyazaki is right. Your pizza sucks and you charging a delivery fee discourages people from tipping your drivers. Absolutely vile business model in addition to garbage pies. At least you like Nioh.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	@AceJakk I'm too busy counting my money to really care about either of your opinions. Besides, haters gonna hate.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	@PapaJohns @AceJakk  LOL! Respect
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	This guy gets it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	reminds me o Onimusha..... what a game.....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	Now that I've been away from my PS4 for a couple months, I find myself thinking of this game. I had thought I had my fill of the game, but something has my mind returning to it. That's definitely a mark of a good game. When this is inevitably on sale this fall, people on the fence should definitely give it a try.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	Enjoying it so far. Only downfall for me is some areas of the maps feel a little claustrophobic and tight, and the mass Diablo-like loot is a bit of an overkill. Combat is really good. May compete with Dark Souls, but no where near Bloodborne's mastery.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	"Bloodborne is a masterpiece how is Nioh rated better, it's a good game just not on the same level
It's a good game, I'd give it 7.5"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	I like it tight.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	Having played and beaten all of the games in the Souls series, I can honestly say that I like Nioh a lot more. The loot drop system is much more rewarding and combat is a lot more varied, fast-paced and challenging. I also like the setting and environments much more too, though Bloodborne's dark-gothic look was really cool. I think the only thing I liked more about the Souls series were its boss battles. Nioh's bosses are fine, but there is nothing that can compare to the likes of the Gaping Dragon, Sif, the Looking Glass Knight, etc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	I came back to say this game kicks ass. Just got it today, and it has such a good feel of Samurai meets Dark Souls
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	Solid game. Still nearly 1000 people looking at the review. Game has legs. Can't wait for the inevitable sequel.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/02/nioh-review	I have returned!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	"Purchased it last night. Beat it in one sitting. How it's allowed to be called ""IV"" is beyond me. Felt like a cheap rom hack with all original assets/sprites looking waaay out of place. For only seven bucks though, I guess you get what you're paying for."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	 Double Dragon NEON was a hoot.  I'd rather see that one ported to Switch.  Sadly, we're getting this dud.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	"Looks like ""Double Dragon"" Has been ""Double Down"""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	Agreed, they should have tried to make a newer yet retro game instead of just retro. If I want to play retro, I will take out the old systems or emulators and play them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	IGN never puts games into the contex of what the game is supposed to be. You can tell the reviewer never played the game growing up. Comparing the game to other beat em ups that came after it i makes no sense. The makers obviously went for a nastalgic trip by making close to the original and it should be put into that context. Not judged by Someone who finds his info on the game from Wikipedia but by Someone who played the original when it came out
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	Double Dragon II was my NES favorite back then. The crouching-to-knee move was devastating and satisfying as hell, and wasn't too easy to pull off because you had to time the move to work. I saw in the trailer that the knee move is still intact, but can be expanded upon. Looks awesome and I will buy it for 7 bucks. Now if only I can find it in the mess that is called the PS Store... cause searching for Double Dragon only gave me the arcade archives or Neon something games...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	They should have turned it into a 3D first person punch 'em up
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	@Cfunkenstein  Agreed
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	@Cfunkenstein  or platform but like 3d backgrounds like they did with some other old games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	"I haven't played this game yet, but there is a clear pattern of retro hate from IGN toward the Double Dragon Series. The last DD game I can remember being released—Double Dragon Neon— was also given a terrible score by IGN, and it's review echoed this one's bullshit about ""staying too true to the spirit of the original."" Double Dragon Neon was a great game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	 I like Double Dragon. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	For 7 dolars, I didn´t expect to much. Its a regular game. Preferred a sequel to Double Dragon Neon. Or a remake for Double Dragon II.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	Not if only we can get a proper Streets of Rage sequel. I can only wish.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/01/double-dragon-4-review	@BigDaddysHouse  It won't happen with reviewers like this. The reviewers have to realize this is a retro game. It's supposed to look dated!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	WHEN YOU WALK AWAY
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	I just got it new for $34 and I think its worth it. Thats why I wait for games to come down in price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	"WTF the games is name is
""Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue"" 
LOL. I don't know what to say."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	Is this game the same thing as KH 1 and KH2? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@benjamin127 Nope. This contains three different entries in the series. One of them is a remaster of a 3DS game, and the other two are brand new installments.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	TBH, I'm moreso here to see if IGN f*cks up and the comments ,but I've been waiting for this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	"I absolutely love Kingdom Hearts. The wait for Kingdom Hearts 3 has been over a decade long now, its really ridiculous. This 2.8 is a joke, it really makes me question video game reviews in general. First a demo for the third game....they gave out other demos for free for the previous games. Then the 3DS game with bad voice acting. Then its A FREAKING MOVIE OF A WEB BROWSER GAME?!?!?! Are you kidding me?

Just watch the movies on youtube to get caught up with the story, which btw is just so convoluted. I honestly just think they should reboot the whole series. 

I don't understand what the hold up is for Kingdom Hearts 3. Yes, Disney has gotten a lot of great IP's since then, so maybe they are adding them to the game. They better after all this wait."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	 The only thing good about 2.8 is that gamestop will give me 20 dollars back of my 70 dollars spent 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	How come a remastered Dream Drop Distance + additional stuff get a lower rating than the original 3DS game? Kind of weird.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@Kaunte The original 3DS game wasn't $60, and to most importantly it was a 3DS game. Meaning it was held to a different standard, specially for having come out 5 years ago. The HD cutscenes are absolute garbage, and add barely anything to the lore. 0.2 though is actually a really satisfying demo, and hold up the whole bundle, which is really sad considering it only lasts about 3 hours.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@Kaunte  because additional stuff isn't worth the money 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	"I really hate this giant cash grab. Seriously, Square, 60 bucks for an extended demo, hd cutscenes, and a 3DS port?
At least 1.5 and 2.5 offered two full blown games! And you're packaging both of them together!
I'll wait for a price drop, should be pretty substantial once KH 3 is out."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@Benschachar  You mean IF KH 3 comes out. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	Is dream drop distance fun to play?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@Xethmawt Absolutely. It's one of the best in the series. It has fantastic combat, and the side content is great too. Also, the story is HUGELY important, though the downside is the fact that for a lot of the game, the story sits on the back burner until the end.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@Trasce @Xethmawt Not considering Re:com, re:coded, and 358/2, DDD has, objectively, one of the worst combat systems of the series. There are no revenge value, physical attacks barely do any damage, and it basically becomes a bollonra spam. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@Xethmawt  dream drop is fun but the actual birth by sleep 0.2 is a rip off
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@Xethmawt  To play? Yes. The story is trash though. Needlessly convoluted. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	"@LordRogerSmith @Xethmawt The story in all KH games is convoluted, though.

You need to give square all your money and play every game for it to make sense. DDD relies heavily on the other games and mostly just answers some lingering questions."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@noahc18 @LordRogerSmith @Xethmawt  I've played all the games. True, the story just keeps getting more and more complicated, but DDD takes it to a ridiculous level. It's almost laughable. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	Dear god, this series is such a baffling and disjointed mess in so many ways...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	"@oscgee It certainly is when you can't get to each game. Which is very understandable since they released games for such a variety of different consoles...

But with the whole picture, it's really not that difficult to keep track of. Everything connects.

It's become a very broad overarching storyline, but it's not that disjointed, and it certainly isn't baffling."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	@oscgee Ive bought 1.5 remix and have no idea what to do with the franchise, its just a bumbling mess on so many levels, like they deliberately made it confusing to wrap them up in new bottles. Ive given up on even entering the series or play 1.5 ReMIX which i bought around its release.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/26/kingdom-hearts-hd-28-final-chapter-prologue-review	"@TheGamerPandA @oscgee What are you confused about? You can just go through the series in the order it's presented in the collections. You can play KH1, then the sequel Chain of Memories, and then watch Days if you want. Then you go through the 2.5 collection, which has KH2, followed by Birth by Sleep, and then you can watch Re:coded if you want. Then the 2.8 collection.
Everything's literally given to you in order. There's nothing to figure out."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	a MUST play for all tales fan. and if your debating over FF15 or this? this easily.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	When compared to Tales of Zestiria which I actually loved this game feels like busy work.  The characters are nowhere as developed as in Zestiria.  The map is nowhere as large.  The combat I believe did take a step forward; however, every 10 hours or so will go by and you will reach a point in the story where you think hey they could end it here.  Unfortunately, it keeps going forward.  Because of that I feel like the game gets an 8.0.  Very unpolished and felt like a step back from its predecessor.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	""" While Berseria flips the script on Tales' normally sunshine-filled stories""???
Yeah like friends killed, world to be doomed, entire population becoming racists, son abducted, doomsday fortress revived, being hunt to death is very sunshine-filled stories"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	Honestly, couldn't make it past 35 hours. Characters were fleshed out probably the best part of the game. Combat was fun and engaging, but after 30 or so hours, became a chore. The story didn't drive me enough to care about getting to the next area.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	"Whoever was translating the subtitles seem to have given up once you get to the optional quests near the end. Kind of strange since the rest of the game followed the dialogue for the most part.
Fun game though, finished it last night. 8.5 for me."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	how many more games will be heavily inspired by berserk.. I wonder..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	@treedogs this being the best berserk game imo, unless Dark Soul is considered.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	does anyone think the dlc costumes are worth it? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	This or FFXV?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	@johnmhr This
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	@johnmhr XV
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	"@johnmhr depends on your preference. me personally id go with final fantasy

this new tales is still good though"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	@johnmhr  If you like old school RPG's with great characters and a well written emotional story then this is definitely your game. If you subscribe to the new world of side content as filler, and empty promises go with FF.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	@johnmhr Why not both? I'm certainly going to, though FFXV going to have to wait for me since I don't have a PS4 at the moment. Personally, I hope it's released for PC eventually.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	"I don't think the author played many Tales games if she says they're filled with ""sunshine"". But hey IGN is full of stupidity. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	@jayaznable most girl gamers are posers
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	@jayaznable  How I read it is that in the other tales games you're preventing wars, the destruction of the world and everything for the sake of humanity. This was pure selfishness and vengeance driving Velvet who is willing to kill so many people to feed her revenge, not really a common trait in the main characters of other tales games. It wasn't until the end when they were like, oh hey we should get more behind Velvet's plan because now humanity isn't really living and that is unacceptable, Artorius be crazy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/tales-of-berseria-review	"Probably my least favorite combat system, but the story and characters are enjoyable.
Edit: It got better later on in the game."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	Just finished playing through the game all in PSVR and thought it was really great in VR, tried playing it on my tv mid way through and really missed the immersion and 3D so kept to VR the whole way through. Played with full smooth controls the same as on a TV and never had any sort of motion sickness, shame more games like this don't have a VR mode for those comfortable with it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	"This review is beyond accurate. It stands out from others, but does it truly accomplish what players wanted? Eh, hard to say.
It definitely has its high points, like the story line itself, the creepy characters and scenes, and even the setting altogether. But the enemies were basically the same throughout, so within the first 5 min we all learned how to beat the game. While the boss fights were interesting, they were simple (i.e. we all knew we had to shoot the glowing eyes on the Jack boss fight...). I would have liked to see more variation here, just as the review mentioned. Albeit, I thought the tape scenes were unique. I probably would have done something a bit different with them, but I liked how if you played them, you got a clue into how to beat it in the actual game. It was unique because the game didn't force you to play the tapes. They just put them there and hoped players would do something with them. 
Overall, I enjoyed this game. I would definitely agree with the rating. Great review!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	Just received this game for Father's day. All my patience saved only 20 bucks. Can't wait to dig into it. I have heard great things about this game from people who have actually played the game. Those are the true reviews. Some little crackpot playing a million games as a job and having deadlines will never be able to give the full scoop.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	Haters gonna hate. Lovers gonna love. This review is none of the above. No clue what the reviewer wants from the game. It was good-it was bad. It was average?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	Great reveiw but not neccessary with the spoilers. You need to give a little warning or avoid all together!h A big thing about the old Res series was it's unique monsters that appeared later in the games like the hunters etc. You touched on some important aspects and lore and with respect but needed a little less of your own opinion.. I've played the game twice now and the only thing I think that's missing from this review is the length of the game. I understand that it's an attemp to re-create res 1, how about taking some notes from res4... as in the hours to complete
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	Anyone else that played in VR feel the effect of passing thru the flooded basement? While sitting playing, I got the full effect of walking thru murky water and I just started the other day. Look forward to more. Close to an hour, I needed a break from the VR but worth the experience

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	@EvilStekske R1 is how you use healing items, but you need to mix herbs with chemicals to make them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	@Zynale @EvilStekske Thank you very much Zynale,you helped a lot :-)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	@Zynale @EvilStekske In USA it's illegal mixing herbs and chemicals.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	I played the demo of this game and it freaked me out.  Although the demo was all I could physically handle.  Unfortunately, I cannot play first person games because I get motion sickness.  I wish they had made this third person, or given an option for third person, but I get this also caters to VR.  I can't imagine playing VR with this game.  That would be even scarier!  My favorite RE games are the original RE and RE4.  Glad they are getting back to survival horror.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	The game is at least a 9 this is one of the best Resident Evil games ever created, easily on my top 3 RE games, it is not just a good game IGN a reminder why people should never take these reviews seriously
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/23/resident-evil-7-biohazard-review	What is wrong with this reviewer..she has no idea.. has she played he pther RE games? I bet not!. this is easily a 9.5! How did she come up with that absurd number? That reviewer should go back and rewatch twighlight while IGN hire real gamers to review games of this genre. The graphics, the sound, the gameplay, everything about it is vey good.. and im saying this about the NON psvr version. The VR version is explosive.... it is brilliant. The work done in that mode is perfection.... if u havent played this game in VR mode then you are simply missing out on a very special experience. VR is simply on another level.. and only the people who experienced this game in vr would know what im on about. Proved the VR can handle aaa games, and excell in the horror genre as if it was made for it.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	Been playing this game for about 5 hours now.  I'm still really early on, but so far it has yet to take to me like something like GTA5.  There's been way more dialogue than gameplay, and with the Japanese setting, it's really hard for me to remember specific names.  Combat seems fun, I just need more experience with it so I can get the hang of it more.  The mini-games I've played so far are a mixed bag.  Karaoke and bowling are fun, but the old sega arcades seem like I'm playing them on a super cheap cell phone or something.  Batting practice is jst lame.  Still, I've got 5 hours of play, and I'm barely 2% complete, so it definitely seems like this game is gonna eat up some time.  Hope it gets better, though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	Comparing this classic to Vice City for 1980's nostalgia?  Are you kidding me?  Try playing Vice City again now and you'll quickly realise how clunky the gameplay mechanics really were and the graphics looked like Lego bricks.  You cannot beat the Yakuza series for open world gangster gaming excellence.  Sega does what Rockstar don't don't dont.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	"@Fennarth in terms of making an open world feel open... they do a way better job. gta 5 felt like a lifeless city in a lot of ways 

does that make sense? "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	@worlddontknow @Fennarth Yes, it does make sense.  This is why I prefer the Yakuza series as every game has always felt like a living, breathing Japanese city which I never wanted to leave.  GTA is monotonous in comparison.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	The next gen update put in a lot more traffic and what not. That helped.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	Playing this at the moment and loving it. Such a good game. Just reached chapter 4, after the rather short chapter 3, atleast when compared to the long chapter 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	"@BermudaTriangle the game gets way better around chapter 4 or 5

2-3 are kind of meh... but the game being so great makes up for it"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	8.5 is a fine score, but the replayability of this game and all the side quests is nuts. The cabaret club czar side quest is probably the most fun side quest I've ever had in a game. It's almost its own game. This game is an easy 9.5 for me. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	@bie2344  the cabaret club is literally its own game forgot there was a main story when I was playing , also the music when you do the makeovers it just the icing on the cake
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	@bie2344 yeah i love that too. my only complaint was you couldn't go back to the club at certain parts of the game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	I can't wait to for yakuza but I still have to get through final fantasy xv, gravity rush 2, which I'm loving, and nioh. 2017 seems to be delivering the next gen games we were expectin g 3 years ago.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	Purchased this over nioh last night. Came in from work and I am surprised I chose right! This game is great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/19/yakuza-0-review	Nioh is on the same level. IMO is more responsive and fluid in terms of combat. Great games I think nioh is a step above though.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/10/gravity-rush-2-review	@SteveBuck07 quite long if you plan on completing all the side missions and even longer if you wanna platinum it. i've been playing it on and off for about 2 hours a day for the past week and a half and i'm only just about to start the 3rd act.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/01/10/gravity-rush-2-review	"Gravity rush 2 has come out of nowhere for me and what a game. There is no other game like this. great art style, unique and fun mechanics, amazing world design. I couldn't recommend this game more.
I've bought all recent triple A games from titanfall 2 and dishonoured 2 to FF and resident evil, this game though... Wow. I'd actually give it 10/10. If any of you are worrying about the price tag, it's worth it. Dont miss this game"

I'll always remember my first time dropping acid and free roaming that world for what seemed like hours as one of my favorite gaming moments. I wasn't expecting much from the sequel but now I may just make time for it.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@Sinsko  agreed.  i'm not a big racing fan either but this game was fun.  and i enjoy mario kart a lot as well
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	i didn't think forza was this popular of a xbox brand when i think of xbox i think mostly of gears of war and halo and shooters never would of thought forza was a console seller
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Yea Forza keeps getting better and better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	"@sunnypisspot In part I think it's because the PS4 really failed to deliver a lasting alternative, and the most famous alternatives are famous for all the wrong reasons (""DriveClub is good now"" could be printed on the side of every building in the world but nobody would touch it). Every time over the last few years I checked out what racing games were on the horizon, Forza keeps topping the list. That said, I'm not enough of a racing fanatic to bother changing from a PS4, but I would tell anyone who is to consider an Xbox for it"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	If a driving game isn't special, its very very ordinary.  I think I own Project CARS and spent 5 minutes with it.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	racing doesn't sell a lot of consoles, but racing games have never needed to depend on graphics power to be great, just solid physics and controls, a good line up of cars, real or fake, good connectivity and good tracks.  The Forza team seems to nail these things while the others seem to have just added weather effects to weather beaten game play.  good for them.  I haven't bought a console for them, though.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	why is this series annual and can someone tell the difference between this game and its yearly counter parts
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Forza started with Forza Motorsport, which is a simulation racer in the likes of Gran Turismo. Forza Horizon is a joint development between Playground Games and Turn 10 (the creators of Motorsport) and started as a spinoff. It's an open world racer that is a hybrid between an arcade racer and simulation. It revolves around festivals in which every races is spread across the world. They're totally different racers, and I personally prefer Forza Horizon series more. Both are some of the best racers on the market.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	"Motorsport: Serious racing on race tracks, more simulation based
Horizon: Open world fun racing on pretty much everything, more arcade based and has a story revolving around a festival.

It's not really an annual series but two bi-annual series, they do share the same core hence they are both called Forza."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Its a fantastic game but the way this review is written its got a tone of bias. The map is quite small
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Can't wait to play this...but waiting for a sale. In Canada it's $34.99 if I remember correctly...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Anyone else find it odd that there are so many green leaves in those shots?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@DuilliathCoF Most trees in Australia are evergreen so in the areas it snows the trees are still green.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	"@DuilliathCoF
It's more strange to see a huge mountain in Australia. Snow happens there sometimes, but giant, rocky mountains? Never. 

I do like the environment, though. It reminds me of my current home, Alberta Canada. It just needs some conifers. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	I wish this game was on PS4 as well :(
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@Duggs26 Buy an xbone as well. I have both consoles because there's too many exclusives I don't want to miss out on. The xbone is almost worth it just for Forza Horizon 3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@Duggs26 Gran Turismo 7 better deliver or the PS4's in a lot of trouble...Forza's already got a huge foothold on the racing bid and there are not many other games that match it so far.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Hoping gran turismo 7 is amazing so forza 8 will have to step it up a lot
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Gran Turismo hasn't delivered since 3 and the Playstation brand is doing just fine.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@Duggs26 A pc on the side is what you need 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Sony has no chance with grand tursimo. I cant imagine what they would have to do to be better than fh3. And I am only a casual racing player.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	It won't really be competing with fh3, it will be competing with Forza Motorsport. Still a big task.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@1flyin1 IF Sony could only make an offshoot of Gran Turismo to the caliber of Horizon, then they'd have nothing to worry about, but with Bandai/Namco's lackluster Ridge Racer 7 and nothing else coming soon, I think they're in for a heck of a lot of trouble.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@1flyin1 I love both Forza series, but Horizon is more my style of play. My big problem with Motorsport is that their tracks are fantastic, but lacks selection. I appreciate the IMMENSE detail put into each track, but they've had the same tracks since Forza 3. Granted I haven't played Motorsport 6 completely yet, I will soon, Forza Horizon has the advantage of having race tracks anywhere in it's world and with Horizon 3, you can almost customize your tracks. Anyways, never played Gran Turismo, but Forza is a beast of a racing franchise.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@thelostscribe @1flyin1 I've found myself to prefer Horizon for fun factor, but if I'm looking for more of a simulation, I go with Forza. GT is more of a sim, like FM.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	The only real issue I have with the game may sound like a weird problem to have but I honestly just can not decide whether I want to be playing it in car or behind car!! Simulators or games close to a simulator (Forza 6) should always be played in car in my opinion and arcade racers always behind car. The problem with Horizon is it's not a simulator but it can't really really be called an arcade racer either, it is smack bang in the middle. So for me both views just don't quite feel right. First world problems I know lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Is it Burnout 3? No. But it's definitely arcade. I HATE sim racers like Gran Turismo and maybe Motorsport if it's very similar to GT (never tried it). I absolutely love Horizon 3 because it's so loose. Smashing into a wall/car is practically encouraged. Not so with Sim racers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	That maybe so but it definitely is more simulator than real arcade racers. Try to drive a 70's muscle car in a straight line that you've just added 500hp too with all the aids off and you might eat your words.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	It's an arcade racer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	To an extent yes but it definitely has a lot more simulator in it than games like Trackmania Turbo or any of the need for speeds.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	"Well then I guess all the settings and tune ability are just there for looks.
Dummy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	If you think that's an extensive sim-worthy list of settings and tune ability, there is no hope for you. It's an arcade racer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	Its a hybrid
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	@AceJakk While it's true that Forza's settings/tunability options are surprisingly lacking compared to the likes of, say, PCARS, it's still waaay more than you'll get from the likes of full arcade racers like NFS and The Crew...  Hell, the original Forza Motorsport had more tuning options than the equivalent Gran Turismo entry(caster angle adjustment really helped in setting up my FWD cars)...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/21/forza-horizon-3-blizzard-mountain-review	I use the far chase cam for drifting and cockpit view for racing

Personally, over the hood view is for me. The seating position is all wrong for me and the view is just wrong, in car. I don't think I'm tall enough to appreciate the affect. Over the hood gives me  the sense that I'm in a car, while allowing me a clear view of the road. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	Seriously. Have spent about a week playing this game. All I have to say is if you have PSVR then you should have Werewolves Within in your game catalog. One more thing. All the issues in the review have been fixed in a patch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	"Bought this game a couple of days ago and I've probably got about 5 hours of time into this (as much spare time I could muster so far) and I have yet to come across any issue mentioned in the review. 

Wish IGN would re-review this game now that the ""bugs"" are resolved. It's frustrating that the world has moved on to a fix as you go model (whether you like it or not) yet IGN does an initial review and then leaves it at that especially when it seems (in this case) that the game copped a lower review due to bugs which have been patched within a month or two of release. 

I'd give werewolves an 8 / 10 but would give a 9 if they added some more game modes (different timer settings etc)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	They have this bundled with eagle flight for 54.99.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	Now that all the bugs are fixed I'm jumping in. Helps that it's on sale as well!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	 I was a little hesitant to get this game especially at $30, but I finally caved last night and I am so glad I got it.  I have played for several hours now and it appears that the bugs mentioned in the review have been patched.  Such a fun, immersive social experience.  The community is very helpful and make this game a true joy to play.  You can vote to kick any players who are ruining the experience and it really helps to keep each round enjoyable.  This will be my go to VR game for a long time to come.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	I love the game, and i have played eve Valkyrie, surgeon simulator, lethal vr and a host of other vr experiences. The games are always super fun, and delightful depending on if you know how to fool groups of people. Id rate this a 9 in my opinion. How this game got a 6 for bugs that I have only experienced once is beyond me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	"The mic bug and book bug have now been fixed. Yes there are still other bugs with the game but they don't happen as often as this review has you believe. You can quite easily play a good 2 hours without encountering even a single problem. The problem isn't with the PSVR mic either, again the review seems the indicate this, it was a problem across all platforms, but UbiSoft are working on more patches to make it run smoother.
In all honestly the is one of the few VR games that I continually go back to. Each game is different depending on your role and the tactics your opponents tend to use. The community is also great, not once have I encountered a single hostile person on there, everyone is willing to help newbies and even when in the lobby waiting for new players you can get into some great conversations with people from across the globe. In terms of the 7 minute time allowance, this is PLENTY of time use your detective skills as a group and figure out who amongst you is lying, any longer would be too drawn out especially if you manage to get a good group of people who are on the ball then its possible to weed out the werewolves in a few minutes. I have had this game for over two weeks now and still find myself wanting to go back for more. Especially when you want to get that elusive unanimous deviant trophy.
If this was a bugless game I would probably give it a 10/10. But until those small glitches get fixed id still be happy to give it a 8.5/10. No its not the best looking VR game out there nor is it the most immersive, but is one of the few VR games that can keep you coming back for more over and over. Great communities, great attention to detail and hilariously fun. You can beat the feeling knowing you pulled the wool over a group of strangers. 8.5/10 with lots more potential - BUY IT "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	"If you DON'T have VR, an awesome 3D alternative coming soon is ""Throne of Lies: The Online Game of Lies & Deceit"". Google the trailer :)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	1 hour eh? Reviews aren't really accurate for this game. It truly depends on the people you run into. Luckily I have run into some hilarious people. One example is a guy that sounded like Sylvester Stallone super drunk. Play it more Pearce
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	"After hearing that this game was the second coming savior for vr I had high hopes but my gutt told me it was another buggy average game which outside of vr would be unremarkable and it looks like I'm right.
I don't want to be as I'm sick of such low quality novelty games being released.on a console package I paid nearly a 1000 for.
Going into Xmas I had hoped there might be one decent aaa or really well made game to fill the endless void of tech demos between launch and next summer when far point allegedly lands.
..but.not to be.
I guess being scared half to death by res in January will have to do."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/werewolves-within-review	@WINZEN_TWEEN This game is exactly what you'd expect it to be, and that's obviously a really fun social game not a AAA wonder. If your social skills suffer I can see how that might sting. Resi7 is out in days. Get that if you want to support bigger games on the system. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	Okay I had to make a profile on IGN just for this review.  Did the reviewer even play more than a few hours?  This is a great game, I highly recommend it.  I've been loving it, definitely have gotten further that the dude who wrote this review, and I find that it gets better as it keeps going.  It gets way, WAY harder later on but there are so many more rewards.  I love the character design, and the overall feel of the game is super unique.  It is by far NOT a Dark Souls clone, it has its own thing going for it.  The ONLY thing I could agree with is maybe a slightly clunky targeting system, but once you learn how to just hit people without targeting then you're golden.  Play this game, it's like a 9/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	@MikeRatMusic  the game is trash, sorry sony fanboy
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	This game is super awesome. I don't know why reviewer would consider controls clunky and combat clumsy. Controls are actually one of easiest to adapt I've seen in a game and clumsy combat is not so clumsy anymore when you have gate behind you shut down and 6 guys with knives swarming around you. Everything is awesome here, Tokyo death metro raids and base defenses, haters, hunters, expeditions, crafting, EVERYTHING.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	"I downloaded this after my wife got a PS4 Pro and a 4KUHD TV and I absolutely love the game I just did a 4 hour Twitch stream (still getting use to how Twitch works on PSN compared to the very gimped Xbox app) though my wife is the major Sony fan and last time I owned a Playstation was the original PS2 Fatboys and the PS1 with the infamous GameShark Adapter.  Though not since she has a PS3 and now PS4 Pro the only systems either of us have owned and still do is a Wii/WiiU, Nintendo Switch but she wants one if a Pokemen game comes out on it and the Xbox One S because I have a Day One Edition and until ""Project Scorpio"" comes out honestly no need to ""upgrade"", Honestly the only thing that I don't like cause I didn'y pay attenton was spending all my money and not allowgating points right -_- made for an amusing game play.though."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	I love the art style of this at least!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	Woooow! How about playing the game first. I'd be so pissed if I'm the developer. People use these reviews to make decisions sometimes and you costed them some downloads. Step up your game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	@ghost__49  Sounds like he didn't even game to begin with.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	Amazing game. Would've even paid $60 for it. Can't wait for updates. Give it time and it will grow on you
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	Personally I love this game and am looking forward to updates. I am currently on floor 17 because I get to rarely play the game because it is a family PS4, the only problem I have with it is the parrying because it's annoying trying to parry bc you have to stand still, other than that I love the game. I hope this game will get supported like war frame and other f2p's. Also this reviewer has obviously barely scratched the surface of this game and I am very disappointed in this reviewer, at least finish the game before you make a review, not the first four floors.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	As many people have pointed out whoever wrote this clearly didn't play for very long. All the features mentioned in the review are found on floor one and the fact that they think buying equipment gets expensive shows that they haven't even unlocked raiding yet (or at least only tried it once). The game has fun simple combat and interesting themes I recommend giving it a try.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	I'll pass.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/16/let-it-die-review	"I have 1 very important tip for anyone about to play this game: Do NOT sell the golden frogs/snails/rats like I stupidly did.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/07/steep-review	I have to say I love the game and find the paragliding mechanics extremely polished and fun. The whole updraught systems seams really smooth and my least favourite sport is probably wing suiting. Not Because its bad. Its just  not as interesting, mechanically, as the others.Loved the game and hit max level the other day just to find out that Alaska was coming in a week. Cant wait for the other Paid Dlcs to and will continue to play on and off until the season pass is over.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/07/steep-review	Its like young pepole still have no say in how a game should be made 70% of the people that will buy this game will chase it to be like ssx and its anything but this is pure shit i mean its cool your on a mountain its big and you can have a wing suit but tricks really you wanna call this tricks? Grab flip and twist its crap make it fun! And gheez did no one teat out the missions theres so much stuff packed into one run its so boring you have to go so slow or just keep trying fast and constantly restarting this game is good if you wanna free ride down a moutian on skiis or snowboard but other then that it has no other purpose ohh unless u want different colour jackets and skiis yayyy fml
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/07/steep-review	Gonna be honest - as much as I love snowboarding, I never owned or played a game like this in my life, so I may have nothing to compare it to, but...I absolutely love this game so far. I do agree though, I'm not a fan of paragliding, it's slow and I have trouble controlling it sometimes, but other than that? Mad fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/07/steep-review	I believe games like this go online only not to punish you and couch coop but bc when they dont you will have 4 second top times down mountains and stuff. They want to keep it fair so a record time is achievable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	Tbh I expected way more from this game. As they have been working on this game for so many years, almost everything in this game looks the same. The relationship between the two characters is beautiful, but it's really hard to find the way sometimes, which tests my patience & stresses me out. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	That 7 is ridiculous. Almost as ridiculous as the 7.5 IGN gave Kingdom Hearts II. This was an absolutely incredible game. The camera, yes, it was wonky at times. But my goodness, that annoyance was minor compared to the full experience of the game. The Last Guardian is an unforgettable journey. Shame on you, IGN. And shame on other gamers for the poor sales this game had. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	@wizardninja I completely agree. I bought into the delays and less than amazing review scores (for a Ueda game) and lost all my hype when this game was released. After finally playing it I am amazed. Easily one of the most unique games I have ever played and in my top 3 favorite games. Maybe it was heavily patched since it was originally out, but the complaints the review mentions seem so minor to me after playing it. Its a shame that this game was criticized heavily for such, IMO, minimal issues. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	The Last Guarding blew my mind. The connection between these two characters is beautiful and this game makes you part of this relationship. Cried bitterly towards the end almost refusing to continue playing it because I was afraid of what might happen. So wrapped up in this game. Will never be able to forget this journey. Bought this game on a hunch not knowing much about it or the creator but couldn't be more satisfied. No game will ever compare. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	"@nannercorn  Get the remake of Shadow of Colossus when it comes out.  You'll be grateful for this recommendation.

In fact, look up videos of it and the trailer for the remastered version.  It's made by the same people who made The Last Guardian."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	It's telling that even now, people are still coming here to share  their profound experiences with this game and the comments here are a complete contrast to those posted when the game came out. I can appreciate the frustrations people were having with the controls & camera (not an issue for me), but on the other hand, by focusing so much on these issues I think that some people missed something truly spectacular here that will become a landmark in gaming history. This game is much more than the sum of it's parts and having finished the game now, I can say that in my 35 years of gaming, for me, very few games have reached these heights in being able to convey such depth of emotion, beauty and wonder. I think that for so many of us to be saying that this experience was so deep and will stay with us forever points to a possibility that some reviewers were so focused of the technical shortcomings that perhaps they ended up not being able to see the woods for the trees - and by overly engaging in such negative feelings as a result, unfortunately missed out on a profound gaming experience. Not that I necessarily disagree with all their observations - I swapped out my old PS4 with a PS4 pro at this time, which helped tremendously with the frame rate - but I think that a 7/10 was a misstep here. Of course this is one reviewer's view, which is understandable, but looking at IGN as a whole, I feel that to put this next to the myriad of other games that have scored a 7 is a disservice to Ueda's genius and vision in giving us this incredible game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	@Andykars It's like creativity is being sucked out of gaming, when games like this don't get there due. The game was frustrating but it was a deliberately so, which is lost on so many people, when you finally get Trico to do what you want. It's pretty creative. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	"Finally finished playing through this game. The character's controls do feel wonky but only for about 30 minutes and I felt completely in control the rest of the game. 
I understand this game's idea that Trico is a wild animal and at times you have to be patient for him to do as you want but there were a few times in the game that it REALLY teetered between feeling like it was designed to struggle and the game really just completely not complying with you for no apparent reason. 
Camera controls and character controls were very difficult for me to get used to right away but after a little while I had it mastered and never really found it to be an issue for 90% of the game. 
All that being said, this game 100% nails the relationship building between you and Trico. Every single complaint about this game got thrown out the window because I loved watching Trico interact with the world, you, and foes in such a natural manner. 
I was absolutely willing to look past these shortfalls and press on because when this game hit its highs, it absolutely destroyed the ceiling and kept going. 
Definitely not a perfect game but one that I will remember for years to come because I truly have never experienced anything quite like it. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	"The few ""problems"" with this game are actually part of its charm. It deserves a much higher rating than 7. Anybody with any patience will have no problem dealing with the little quirks."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/the-last-guardian-review	"The interesting thing about this review is that it really doesn't read like a 7.0. It reads like someone who wants to give the game a much higher score, but feels obligated to give an average score because of issues that some people might not be able to get past. Which is totally understandable, because everything he says is true; it definitely can be a very cumbersome and trying game.
But a pretty good argument can be made that the elements many people take as simply poor design are actually intentional, because as far as I can tell it would actually be pretty easy, for example, to program Trico to respond immediately to your commands. The fact that he doesn't is almost certainly part of the design, not a ""glitch"" or whatever.
I might be reading too much into it, but there's a proverb that says ""the horse knows more than the rider."" This might be part of the design philosophy behind TLG, because in a time where people are becoming more and more impatient with any loss of control in gaming, and more insistent on immediate satisfaction of their impulses, TLG constantly forces you to hit the brakes and patiently wait for something wiser than you to find the way forward.
Did they do it perfectly? Probably not, there are definitely too many parts that are excessively obtuse and frustrating, even if that was their intention. But a case can be made that TLG succeeded at what it set out to do, and maybe it's something more of us would do well to appreciate."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/dead-rising-4-review	The timer and psychopaths missing is the biggest complaint I have. The game itself is a good solid and very fun open world game. Capcom added new difficulties so hopefully they atleast add the timer back for the actual game and not just frank rising
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/dead-rising-4-review	"The only complaint I have would be the mall being such a small part of the game. It was cool to go back to the original mall and also have the town to explore but the mall felt tacked on. You didn't go to all the places from the original so it didn't feel like it really was the original mall. I'd say you get about 10% of the original mall.  I was disappointed and it felt like a missed opportunity. 
One more thing, how legit could this review even be if the author doesn't know Deadrising is one word. Thats like saying Trans Formers.   It's Deadrising, NOT Dead Rising. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/dead-rising-4-review	I'm part way through Case 3, very much enjoying the game so far and am having a lot of fun. The only other Dead Rising game I've played was DR3, which is basically the first video game I really had played in almost a decade. Anyway, I'm really liking the missions and the different encounters and side missions that pop up along the way. Aside from that, it's fun just wandering around collecting items, taking pictures, etc. Been playing for 10 hours or so, not a dull moment  yet. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/05/dead-rising-4-review	I love collecting the Newspapers, and blueprints.  Going for 100% achievements cleared, but its going to be tough.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/01/the-dwarves-review	@Kvothe1988 @jman1115 As any series of this magnitude there are dull points, mainly around books 4-5 for me. When Brandon Sanderson took over it just made them that much better. He added another layer of emotional development to the story that just kicked it into 5th gear for me. Everyone has their opinions though :D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/12/01/the-dwarves-review	@Kvothe1988 the books aren't bad (just saw your name though love it) I think it's the translation. Something just isn't right about it in english. Drenai saga you say?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	"ADVICE FOR ANYONE THINKING ABOUT BUYING THIS AWFUL GAME.

This game is pathetic! ...so bad, it is unbelievably bad. This game has been released UNFINISHED  ... and don't believe the hype about this game being 'in-development' for 10 YEARS, because that is absolute rubbish !!! ...there is no way that this game has been developed for 10 years.
The voices are annoying, the dialogue is terrible, the characters are SO ANNOYING... they are grossly over Americanised! ... it is either a joke or just very badly done. ...so all that out the way, then we have the actual graphics! ...they are not even finished. They look blurry, they look AWFUL... THE HAIR LOOKS SO BAD, I COULD NOT EVEN BELIEVE IT ...how bad this was. 
I have a theory about some video games these days...and in particular Final Fantasy 15 so here goes: 
+The developers are lazy, the companies focus on profit and sales...not gamer enjoyment. +The game companies release a game that is unfinished, looks bad and has many bugs! +...then they release all these big patches, some up to 4GBS in size !!! ...and we as gamers, supporters and purchasers of the game are supposed to be grateful of the updates !? +Many games will not even start after installing if your gaming rig/console is not connected to the internet. 
SQUARE ENIX should be ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES AS A GAME COMPANY! ...DO YOU HEAR ME SQUARE ENIX ...SHAME ON YOU.. this game is TERRIBLE! 
I will never ever trust a game by this company again... I am new to final fantasy.... and I was told this game would be good.. but there was just too many things wrong with it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	@Svissloki I just finished the game-they patched a lot of things and are continuing to do so. Despite the rough last couple chapters the ending was still powerful enough to leave an impression. After grinding post game a bit and deciding to put the game on the shelf for good,i find myself having trouble finding something that fills its gap. The story may not be 10/10 but the immersive open world, tight combat system and a charming cast results in a game that won't fade out. I don't regret playing through it despite it being my first FF game besides FF tactics
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	"I am also disgusted with this game but I am a long time final fantasy fan. I just don't understand how it can drag so much and your right the voices are very annoying I'd nearly be happier with the old type caption boxes.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	"Seriously this is the worst Final Fantasy game to date and your rating on this game is a little bias towards Sh*tEnix.  I just returned from a year overseas and never read a review on this game then bought it because it's ""FINAL FANTASY"".  FF series had a long history of a 50/50 mix of magic (especially summoning, dark magic, and light magic) and weaponry but this game lacks a huge disappointment in the magic area.  Especially with summoning and curing...  ALERT!!! SPOILER: Now to kill off the summoner/healer halfway through the storyline wtf!!! And easily killing enemies that are suppose to be summons **that was the nail in the coffin for me to never buy a FF game again until I read the reviews***...

Someone earlier in the comments said that turn-based combat is not for AAA games anymore? Well, I must suggest him to check on Persona 5 with 9.3 score on metacritics and easily one of my favorite JRPG's with solid turn-based combat with countless summons, classic magic system, guns and swords.

I'd give FFXV not more than 7.5 and even this score is basically for pretty graphics I guess because gameplay itself, at least for me, feels like something forced, like an activity I'd want to finish asap, like a homework I don't want to do, or something similar.

I guess after FFX SE really dropped the ball?.. Simply disappointed, will go and play Persona 5 for the second playthrough."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	@RockDj911 yea i gotta check that game out for sure. I expect it to be an entirely new caliber. As for the gameplay being mundane, i had the same impression but then it actually grew on me. The dodging mechanic actually keeps me on my toes. It became quite satisfying and addicting for me. Then again, i haven't played other FF games before
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	"I think their rating is a little high.
Final fantasy was one of my favorite series growing up. The last main one i played was ffx and ffx2..(not going to count 11 or 14).
I'm about to fight the final boss. I just don't feel like the story was that great for a final fantasy game. I have 62 hours of time played. And I've been on and off with it since January. Pretty easy game it just has taken me 5 months simply because I haven't been able to get hooked.
The main characters are pretty cheesy and remind me of an anime about high school kids or something. Like some of the cut scenes are so embarrassing they're hard to watch. Gladios over the top tough guy persona is particularly hard to buy into some times.
All of chapters 12 and 13 were kinda bad. 13 especially. Nothing exciting just walking around and upgrading a key card for 2 hours. Then you can barely hear the main. Antagonists monologue at the end of the chapter over noctis gasping and the crystal sound effects.
The game feels rushed and incomplete.
Hoping it has a good ending after I kill the final boss tomorrow. But after 62 hours of game play I can say it is just simply a decent game. I'd wait for the price to drop considerably or pick up a used copy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	@Claffstar yea i wished the story was better. Never played a final fantasy game but that's what i expected from it. The game still has its charms though :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	"The story seemed largely inconsequential to me, until the tail end.
The Coleman camping advertisements are glaring and sad.
Am I the only one who kept reaching for potions, constantly, throughout the entire game? I only got game over like 3 times, but I constantly got my health bar depleted.
I guess its better than FFXIII, but that's not saying much. Now that the Fabula nova crystalis thing is done and out of their system, maybe we can get a nice traditional FF again. Not even ATB; I'm sure that's dead and gone, but a game that feels more like final fantasy. And yes, each numbered FF was its own, but there was a certain vibe that made each one feel like an FF. Hope the next one has it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	Never played a Final Fantasy game before, so I am neither a fanboy, nor do I have a bone to pick with the developers. Just finished this, and honestly...I loved it. Is it perfect? No. The load times are long, and not every plot point is fleshed out. But the core characters and sheer scope are amazing. I would probably give it closer to a 9. I don't know, I just loved it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/28/final-fantasy-xv-review	Is it worth it to invest in the Season pass?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/watch-dogs-2-review	Aiden Pearce is bland and unlikeable??Aiden Pearce has one of the best plots i have seen in years, the struggle of a man to get revenge for the death of his niece that he is ultimatly responsible for, and he knows it. The first one has a much better story and a much better main character, i really liked aiden and not this teenage vigilantes getting followers by taking selfies -.-. Watch dogs 2 is a good game, really liked the drone and the remote control 2 wheeler but i didnt feel any love for even 1 character in this game, well maybe wrench untill his mask come off. But this game is as much fun as it is easy. Oh look a drone someone is here...nah lets not look for the one controlling it lets just shoot it down.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/watch-dogs-2-review	@Mastersystem13 Agreed watch dogs had a great story and aiden was quite likeable and unlike most games recently the campaign was fairly long but that could be because i spent a few hours dicking around but the game did freeze a lot on xb1
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	AC1 was solid, Ezio and the 2 addon's were awesome, the rest suck. Between AC2, and Syndicate - the games weren't really games about an assassin. I mean one was a freakin' pirate. I don't like Syndicate though. I like some of the mechanics but don't like the twin characters, especially the guy. I might buy this when the game drops to about 20 bucks..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	"""Playing through Assassin's Creed 2, Brotherhood, and Revelations highlights just how much the series’ gameplay has improved over the years. The horizontal and downward parkour of Black Flag and Unity made moving through their respective worlds a joy"" 

Improved? I haven't played Unity but the climbing is simplified and downright worse in Black Flag. Everything is automated to one button whereas the Ezio games have running, sprinting, barging, etc. And when climbing there are puzzles where you have to leap rather than just hold the climb button. If this is IGN's definition of improvement then no wonder they get their awful reputation. The climbing in the Ezio games was already incredibly simple and fool-proof, and yet they somehow simplified it further in later games. The same can be said for combat. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	Garbage.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	This looks like a cheap cash grab from Ubisoft. No updates or any effort has been put into this collection or any assassins creed game after the first one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	"Trilogy's environments are the draw, always were, and they haven't been matched by an successive AC game yet.

And I'd disagree about Syndicate's story-line being the best. For me, it was the first AC game with Altair."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	Was there bonus content in the original collection that wasn't included in the remastered collection?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	I am a die hard fan of the Assasin's Creed games for a while now. I hoped that by getting this collection would show some improvements on my favorite games while playable on the PS4. To be frank, I am outright disgusted by Ubisoft's lack to the attempt to save their fans. Since Unity, the games have become more and more bug-filled and lacked any true progress. Sure the graphics are great, and new characters and locations makes it worth playing; but since they have released a game every year, the games go untested and get released with far too many bugs. I was hoping that the bugs in the earlier games like AC2, specifically in the controls should have been resolved. Instead they made unnecessary graphics changes to NPCs that only shows their lack of respect to their fanbase. The PS4 controllers are much more sensitive, and trying to control Ezio is a fast paced challenge such as a race or whatever makes it so damn hard to control that infuriates me to no end. I have not gotten to Brotherhood yet and I am still hopeful that the changes are better for that game but so far, I am disappointed in the changes. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	@tjclair ok i agree its not up to par where it should be for remaster today but i don't like when reviewer said that i don't see who to recommend this game to.tbh yes syndicate and black flag plays better but i want pick this story up to enjoy the ezio story and origin of assassins creed.so i would recommend this to new gamers who haven't played the origin stories ezio stories despite the cumbersome animations.that was there in the non remastered games when you compare to syndicate and black flag of course
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/23/assassinas-creed-the-ezio-collection-review	"""it’s tough to stomach them in a post-Syndicate world."" I found syndicate annoying where I had to use parkour down, the camera spins round and then Evie or Jacob climbs down. in previous games where possible I would simply jump down and take a small heath hit, it didn't really matter as the health regenerates anyway so to be forced to hit b and parkour down was annoying."

It never gave me the download option like most games.. Iv added it to my library about 30 times for the past week........ Can anyone help me figure out where I can access it to start its download? Yes I have a valid ps plus membership. I'd appreciate the help!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	This is, if you're lucky enough to get a game, a really fun, silly shooter. Trouble is, you can't find a game for love nor money.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	Great horde fun. It runs slick on the Pro and its free on PS+. I'd say best ps+ freebie to date . Makes up for the money I wasted on Friday 13th.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	@Enwade It's terrific fun, when you can get a game. I personally don't have 6 hours of my day to waste hoping that I might find a game. Which is a crying hame because when you do find one, it's loads of fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	This game is a ton of fun. So is the very underrated Drawn to Death.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	Another lousy free PS+ game. Absolute garbage

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	The game looks FUN!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/22/killing-floor-2-review	Just got this game. Never heard of it before hope it's good
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	I think they should make a new game but is bassed when the first season of the animie is. So you make your own character and detour away from the main characters and you follow your own path exploring this univers but of cause still some interaction with the main characters but it is low. And because it is set when Sao was first released that means in games it plays the same so if you die on a character you are dead for good and have to make a new one but maybe it has multiplayer to make it easier. Idk about the dying and loosing all your loot and gear but I feel it would make it intense hahah.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@Jomama8yourfood i think you might be onto something, it would even make sense if it was dragons nest-esk with some hardcore modes
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	I agree as well that's a really good idea but about the dying part they should make that a mode
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	I like how ign rates this low, yet most of the player reviews on the internet and on the psn are high. Imo the game should of got an 8. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@ishamaelronin It's an anime game that doesn't completely suck so fans will tend to rate it higher because they already have an attachment and appreciation for the universe and characters. As an example Sword Art Online Hollow Fragment on Vita holds a 7.6 on metacritic by fans, which featured a translation performed by a 10 year old using google translate.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@ChronoMasakari @ishamaelronin I hate to agree with that as a huge fan of the anime, but yes. Hollow Fragment was terribly translated, had horrible combat, and was over the top with fan service. Definitely a 5.5 if not less. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	The Hollow Realization is that Sword Art Online is a terrible light Anime that petered out half way through the first season. Stop buying these games so that other -maybe good- anime games can get made.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	Do you own the game?? Or played it?? I would like your PSN username so I can see if you played this game so I can discredit your opinion to everyone that you are full of sheit!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@gq_foine from the videos it doesn't look all that fun and the anime is shite
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@treedogs so you are a TROLL who doesn't play or own the game.  but comes on this site to spout your garbage and nonsense to everyone since you have nothing to do better to do with your life..  Your parents must be proud!!! HAHHA!.  Wow.. what a great life you must have wasting your time on this..  Must be you are broke and no life but to TROLL this page..  Great job! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@gq_foine @treedogs LOL
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@BossFighter actually the real hollow realization is that your opinions mean nothing when the series sells very well in japan. Even if no one bought the game here it wouldnt matter, they just wouldnt sell it here. It would still sell well there, and have more games made from the series
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@BossFighter Gonna assume you haven't seen the whole series. I'm on the boat that the series is overrated but it's an enjoyable watch, and mother's rosario arc is definitely the best that's been animated by far. That's saying something coming from me, given that I hate Asuna and she's the featured character in the arc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	"@ChronoMasakari @ishamaelronin @gq_foine @treedogs  ha, seriously though if you like the game thats great. I just think there are so many things wrong with this Anime that they just continue to double down on. I can't find a way to apologize for the series at all. Anyways I think I will wait for Persona 5 instead of wasting time on this one. Theres also the FF12 remaster that is in my opinion a better single player MMO-like experience... unless you're looking for the whole meta ""is a single player game in an fake MMO world"" thing thing... I dunno but seriously though Log Horizon does it better as an Anime."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@BossFighter @ChronoMasakari @ishamaelronin @gq_foine @treedogs Was referring to your comment about the anime. The games are fairly generic and shallow but not overly terrible.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	I'll stick to Final Fantasy XIV.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	Why do these anime games suck so bad?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	"@ineedgames

I've heard that Attack on Titan is actually pretty good...but yeah, I'm still waiting for a really good JRPG to sink my teeth into. I haven't played an enjoyable one since last gen with Lost Odyssey and Ni no Kuni. Every JRPG so far this gen has more-or-less sucked donkey balls. Do not have high hopes for FFXV."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@ineedgames I actually am enjoying the game atm, and imo IGN rated it bad because IGN always rates anime games bad. Its more like an 8 and has a lot of player positive reviews. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	The main issue with this review was saying that SAO was great

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	I think it is a little better then 6.7 tbh, honestly it is very similar to the previous SAO games, the gameplay is great, the exploration and bosses are rewarding, the story is mostly all over the place but ok and the tutorials and explanations for its mess of stats and spells and features nonexistent :D I will probably buy this once I am done with Hollow Fragment on my vita, it looks pretty good, im not gonna lie :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@KaiSaeren Its fun, i have played all 3 of the games and its the best one of them so far. IGN just has trash reviews when it comes to anime stuff. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@SengalBoy I kept expecting Vince to call this game Hollow, but he never did, lol. On one level I'm disappointed in that fact, but on another I respect him for taking the high road. :p
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	"IGN is off again!  PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO THEIR HORRIBLE REVIEWS!!  I definitely don't trust Jose Otero Reviews and now I question Vince Ingentio!  This game is definitely higher than 8!  It's definitely not perfect by all means and I have played over 30hrs+ into it I can safely tell you its 1000% better than CALL OF DUTY CRAP that IGN gives 9+!  Battlefront Star wars!   See everyone needs to keep in mind the Advertisers and publishers give money to IGN and so they inflate their reviews on certain games to try to convince to sell more games!  

Sword Art Online is a very good game!  The graphics are absolutely amazing!!  The sound is great! the story is eh ok!!  My only gripe about the game is the AI characters who come along on the journey are absolutely stupid but critical to your battles..  I wished you could customize and equip your other characters that come along and run away when they are about to die and not just stand there!

Second, IGN's score is probably about where it should be for a cash in game about an anime that people either love or hate. Third, no publishers/developers pay IGN reviewers to give a good score and just because they didn't score it what you would have still doesn't make it true. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	"@Carve12  HHAHAH!   I don't like the score.. Ummm..  Let's see looking objectively @ Metacritic which has larger pool of actual people (critics and users) who rate the game it came in higher..  So their baseline is off because looking at the overall average on Metacritic and their IGN user's score its way over what the IGN score that Vince game. I don't frankly care what IGN gave it, but the score IGN gave 6.7 doesn't make it TRUE EITHER!!  You make it sound that 6.7 is BIBLE...  Um please, I can tell you that it's pathetic when you said IGN reviews are NOT paid by publishers when THERE ENTIRE SCREEN IS MADE OF UP ADVERTISEMENTS!!!  Who is paying for IGN, all the GAME ADVERTISERS!  Why don't you take a look at their revenue stream!  Why don't you take a business class 101 and learn how IGN makes revenue??
I guess you are technically right about the customization once you reached level 4-5. But you forgot to mention in that process is that this system is utter BS!! To get to level 4-5 can take more several hours doing the same thing over and over and is frankly a waste in time!! I am talking over 5hrs per character!!!
When is the last game they gave below 6 on EA, Blizzard, Take Two<<>???  When??  All those great- BS! I bought Skryrim and was BORED OUT OF MIND walking around mindlessly doing stupid BS things!  "

2. no where did he say IGNs score was gospel, so quit that. ""Probably"" =/= gospel. but that's funny because you seem to be making metacritc out to be gospel, though. and that couldn't be further from the truth, too. all metacritc is is a pile of reviews in the same boat as this one. and as you seem to think they're ripe for corruption. there's nothing different or better, and you can't have it both ways

3. you don't know how sites make their money at all. publishers don't pay sites for ad space, they pay a 3rd party to get that space for them. those are who thr sites deal with, not publishers. no money is directly handed over from publisher to site. if this game was advertised here then your logic would be blown out of the water, because the ""publisher"" would be paying the site, but oh boy, the site gave a poorer-than-you-want score and IGN just made an enemy of Bandai, who can now refuse them review copies, which directly hurts the reviewer more than the site they work for."

By the way you discredit that IGN doesn't have influence. Yes looking at Metrecritic since it has all the professional reviews in one place so you can see and compare. I enjoy people who discredits Metacritic when obliviously they don't understand Math or statistical analysis. -the law of large numbers. I think you forget that IGN has substantial influence when providing their reviews to users who have never played it!!! I can safely say that IGN reviews are utter garbage!! They told me Battlefront was great!! It's NOT!! They told me Oblivion was amazing it's Absolutley NOT! They told me Skyrim is a perfect 10 its unequivocally NOT!!! So then I do an assessment after these reviews and I have notice that JRPG has crap on and western studios are not. So then it dawns on me. Paid advertisers!!! Don't tell me it's 3rd parties and they don't know. I guess ratings with 3-5 get blasted with advertisements!!!! Oh wait their is no such evidence!! Hmmmmmm.
Wake up and smell the crap!!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	GTA I don't really think it's a 10/10 game. More like an 8/10, oh and EA. Sucks!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@gq_foine The fact you call these graphics a 9.5 completely discredits your opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@CrisisZero let me guess you don't own the game???? Or played at least 50hrs+ into it?  That means your opinion is utter garbage and worthless!!  I own over 1000+ Games< (mostly sealed) and played more than 50%+ of them.  I own over 15 counsels!   What's your stats and lib? Let me guess you own a few XBOX and PS4 games?? And thinks its mighty graphics...  Tell me in 15yrs+ if Oblivion looks better than this game!!  It won't I know... 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	"@gq_foine @CrisisZero well, Crisis didn't even bring up another game, just your opinion. so this just feels like a lot of random talk. but you should have stopped after calling the opinion of your opinion garbage. 

it doesn't matter one bit that you have thousands of games and dozens of systems. it doesn't make you an authority on what people find pleasing (and no reviewer I've ever seen has ever claimed to be). stats and lib don't mean a damn thing other then a lot of time and money was spent on the hobby. that's it.

And I'm sorry, but talking about any game's graphics 15 years later makes pretty much no difference. of those 1000+ games, how many actually hold up graphically? 15.. 20%? and that's being pretty generous. 

And unless they're talking about graphics in some nostalgic way, out of love, you're almost never going to find anyone saying they're totally satisfied by the way most games still look. because most games simply don't look good years later, just like most movies don't. time and technology move on, just like our tastes."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	Fallout 4 reviews from IGN were high as a butterfly. Utter garbage!! I walked around mindlessly looking at the same environment. Let's talk about the story of Fallout 4- complete BS!! Let's talk about the number of bugs in the game???? Oh wait disregard that because that should not affect part of the rating equation??? It seems to me all the western RPG games are riddled with bugs (Skyrim, Witcher, fallout,) Vs Bloodborn, demon souls, dark souls- little to none!! And to be honest I would take Dark Souls, Bloodborn, over Skyrim, oblivion, or witches.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	I know fallout 4 is the worst of the series.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@gq_foine Umm the new COD got a 7.7, not 9+.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/16/sword-art-online-hollow-realization-review	@Pimpaclicious my BAD!!  Wait that's just the new one.. Ook true but what about all those other CODs?  Are you kidding me? 8.5 for modern warfare remaster???  Call of Duty (1) - 9.3, Call of duty Black ops III - 9.2. Call of Duty Advanced Warfare 9.1,  Call of Duty 3 - 8.8, Call of Duty 2 - 8.5?  Call of duty world war - 9.2..  THIS IS UTTER BS!! COMPLETE F*** BS!  All these call of duties are ranks higher than 90% of all games! BS! I CALL BS! EA helps supports IGN advertisement!  I don't give a 2 cents its 3rd parties who are doing..  Right so if IGN gave COD ratings 2-5 you think EA would continue promoting that stuff!! BS!!  WAKE UP! IGN RATINGS ARE FULL OF IT! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	Bruh.....love me some Time Crisis. That would be sweet,Did you mean Pilotwings 64
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	Did he just cite Superman 64?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	@docleephd I think he said Super Mario 64.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	wait.... this has nothing to do with AC?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	I bought a Vive and while i love it its only been 6 months since i got it so large full game experiences are thin on the ground,experiences like this help to flesh out the mainly mini game library, but i think its going to be the VR version of Fallout 4 thats going to do it for me, while certainly not the best fallout i can only imagine what a 100 hour plus rpg looks like in VR.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	@lemonscampi I think it is a great Fallout, with maybe only 3 beating it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	"""yes, like Superman 64""

You mean Pilotwings 64."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	I got Eagle Flight and Drive Club VR on order from Amazon.  My first two games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	"I can't believe how much VR has changed my gaming life, i had no idea it was this good!
Finished Tomb Raider, and Dishonored 2, now working on Titanfall 2/Battlefield.
I would seriously prefer to only game in VR though.
VR is the real deal folks, amazing."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	@dustinwinds Same, I haven't played flat games since PSVR launched. Have no interest in flat sequels.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	I'm the same. FF xv might be the exception, but it does have a vr option.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	IGN 7.6/10- to much feathers
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	Hope this does well, I enjoyed every second of it. Now give us Eagle Flight: New York or London, next!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	Rigs, rush of blood and tethered already justified buying into this tech, for me. I get that the current trend seems to be that the best game is the one that has the best graphics/frame rate/resolution. Seriously though. Continue not buying stuff because it isn't as good as it will be one day. You'll save yourself a fortune... Then you'd never play any videogames. In Atari days. We had imagination to get past graphical limitation. I wouldn't mind, but just looking around at the scenery in rigs after being jettisoned is amazing (on a pro) spoilt brats need to try a spectrum text adventure. Vr may make you feel queasy, it's ok hanging 100ft in the air tends to do that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	@Retroheads I think rush of blood has shown that an almost forgotten genre can be great in VR - the on-rails lightgun game! Give us Time Crisis VR, sony! Light gun games were always limited by the size of the screen you were shooting at but when it's all around you, it's terrific. And Tethered! I played that for hours, I never thought I'd play a god-game for that long in my life, but I couldn't put it down. RIGS is amazing, too - I just wish I wasn't rubbish at it! Heh. I wish it was an action-adventure game, like: RIGS-SWAT or something where you go on missions in the rigs, like a proper SP campaign...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	@scottface @Retroheads Bruh.....love me some Time Crisis. That would be sweet
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	"I've been playing Windlands for the last couple days. It's the best so far for me. And Rigs, Rush of Blood and Thumper are my favorites so far right behind Windlands.
I can't recommend Windlands enough."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/14/eagle-flight-review	@THANA108 agree with windlands, overlooked game.  also enjoy Bound a lot more in VR, wasnt to impressed previously..  also think sports bar is great with a good group of friends, but would be boring without 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	"Was holding off on this for ages. Finally got it this past weekend. Couldnt put it down. Such a fun game. 

Is the story on the level of cinematic genius? Nah.. but its still a fun ride. Gameplay so far is so fun. Im spending so much time exploring and dispatching people in the most brutal and creative of ways. Love it. Great game"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	This is GAME OF THE YEAR. It has to be!!! Arkane are the best developers. I love Dishonored so much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	Great game. Played it on high chaos with Corvo. Now I'm playing the first Dishonored and the DLC's. I can't wait for death of the outsider. I hope Arkane continues to make Dishonored games in the future. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	story this time was ordinary. 7/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	I'm all thumbs or what. It was really hard for me to get used to such a gameplay.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	http://www.pcgamer.com/prey-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	Dishonored 2 certainly has my vote for GOTY. Some of the best level design I've ever seen, with probably the single-best 'level' of all time with Clockwork Mansion (though Stilton's mansion wasn't far behind), impactful and consequential gameplay and game choice, amazing visual aesthetic with top-notch graphics, fascinating lore, and on and on. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	"No Surprise this game was amazing after the first game was also so great. 
When it comes to just pure inventive fun gameplay and Level design Arkane just nail it for me. 

With Prey also coming next year that looks Incredible also, Arkane are a studio to be respected and taking seriously in the AAA space."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	"This is one game i still need to get... Will get it for pc when its cheaper. 
Still playing ff15"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	I dont normally like games like this, mainly due to the art style, its a bit bioshock, which makes me feel sick after playing too long, but based on the high scores it was getting I got it. It's a really good game, the story is what has kept me playing, I normally skip boring cut scenes but they are really good, great voice acting and pretty good visuals. Gameplay is great and it's pretty easy to get into and start unlocking new abilities. Gonna enjoy completing it and then maybe try dishonored 1. For anyone on the fence its a must buy this Christmas.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/13/dishonored-2-review	@xen0letony  turn off motion blur . helps the motion sick feeling
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	This game is one of those controversial games. Some sites rate it poor while others rate it higher. The graphics and immersion are top notch. The gameplay is good but this is mainly an exploring game and not an action game and I think that's where people start rating it poorly. But honestly this is really a good game and a welcome addition to the PSVR lineup. I'd give it a solid 7/10 and definitely a must buy for $49
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	"The reviewer has obviously not bothered giving any time or effort into this game. States that the controls are jerky yet those settings can be changed if needed.
Can't solve simple puzzles in a puzzle solving game so gives it a crap score.
There should be an option to rate the reviewers review. I give this review 2.5/10"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	Been playing this game for a while and still can't climb the mushrooms up the tree. Yeah the atmosphere is cool, but the controls are absolute garbage.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	It's easy, just get better at gaming. Brilliant game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	@GorJam_76 Great idea borrowing from a lot of sources, poor execution. A game that will only please the simplest of minds with the lowest expectations. The few moments of visual splendor are, however, well worth the $1.99 it will eventually be selling for on PlayStation Store.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	I can't even play it without getting sick to my stomach.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	"Im beginning to have some doubts about the future of the PSVR. Its not that the headset doesnt completely blow me away. I mean, Sony did an excellent job, as most reviewers admit, but now something is becoming quite obvious. Putting great hardware into the hands of Developers doesnt mean that they know how to make VR ""Fun"". I've played a multitude of PSVR games and experiences, and its not that consumers are at fault in any way, but being inside a game is only entertaining when the game is entertaining, and so far for me at least, the London Heist was just about the only game that is entertaining. What happens when gamers get accustomed to being within the environments, and it does happen, how are they going to make people ""WANT"" to be there? Robinsons entire ""magic"" is based on immersion, but you arent really doing anything notable. Look at it this way. Is the gamer mentality based on sight seeing? I mean, when was the last time you saw gamers comparing pictures of nature excitedly? That doesnt even happen. I bought Robinson day one because I really needed convincing that VR will have a real future after the rash of tiny over glorified tech demos, masquerading as real full length games, and what did I find? I found a super linear guided tour of my local parks Greenhouse with Animatronic Dinosuars. If Sony wants to make this device successful, they really need to get their 1st party Devs working on a ""Must Own"" game real quick for the sake of their product and consumer base, they need to come out with a graphically impressive, absolutely entertaining, ""Actual"" full length game , or their going to have a modern ""Sega Dreamcast"" on their hands. Sega's hardware was great, but lack of support did it all in. There is sooo much potential to be had, but it all hinges on the imagination of what the developers are offering in the department of fun, and so far that problem seems to be why Sony offered such a huge demo disk of experiences. It appears Sony couldnt get any single experience to pass through the door that separates what gamers would consider ""Great enough to keep them interested and playing for 10's of hours"", from something they'd consider a ""Quick kiss on the cheek,and goodbye forever"" sort of experience."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	"Don't feel too bad it's the same problem on the Oculus, and the VIVE! Everything is very basic tech demo type games. The only game I play for long periods of time with the Rift is Elite Dangerous. Almost all other games are just gimmicky quick ""experiences"". I agree if developers don't start making full on games for these devices they won't survive. I want to see Fallout 4, Skyrim, open world AAA games, and none of that warping crap to move!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	....why does it move soooooooooooooo slowly????
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	Designed by the biggest idiots in the universe... Guaranteed to aggravate the living shit out of you, even before the game even starts... Do you use the move controllers or the joystick??? The menu takes the move controller, but you can't select anything, because for some reason the japanese think the X button on the move controller is different than the X button on the joystick. Well after that aggravation, you find the game uses the joystick, which makes complete sensexwhy your character in the game is holding a move controller....idiots. Now the game starts, and to all new people who are wondering if VR makes you dizzy... This game will guarantee you having barfing in the first 3 minutes, because the moving controls are so aweful that because there is no smooth right analogue view, it just shakes at intervals, making ypu constantly lose your place and get sick to your stomache. Oh look a basketball hoop, you pick up a ball, this should be fun. You try to throw it in the basket, and the ball blasts a thousand mph off to nowhere. Because there is nothing that makes sense any better than putting a basketball hoop in the middle of fantasy nowhere, just to be as unplayable as phuk. Do these programmers even try to play their own games???? But wait, it gets better, what would you pay for this unplayable nightmare demo of graphic proportions? Did it come free? No $19.99 like most better games? No of course not. They put a cute little dinosaur that does absolutely nothing in it, they have to charge you the highest price possible... Thanx sucker!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	How about you go into the gameplay options and set the turning to smooth like normal ppl do. The default controls are to reduce motion sickness in weak gamers. Awesome game by the way
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	@GorJam_76 Weak gamers..... Normal people.... Someone obviously has self esteem issues. Great idea borrowing from a lot of sources, poor execution. A game that will only please the simplest of minds with the lowest expectations. The few moments of visual splendor are, however, well worth the $1.99 it will eventually be selling for on PlayStation Store.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	"Mediocre? Really? WAYY OFF. This is an AMAZINGLY Immersive game. Beautiful. I did get quite motion sick the first time- it helped to make the turning using ""pie chart"" option and only move in the direction you are facing. Do not slide sideways or go backwards. The levels of puzzles is fine...the game is amazing. I would have given it an 8/10."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	I have to agree with this review completely. I was curious what others thought after I finished it. Glad I'm not alone. I truly hope this is not what we can expect in the future for the psvr.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	@Flipvan Why would you expect all games to be the same or like this? Especially since we've already gotten a nice taste at what PSVR can do? Obviously this is a singular experience that just didn't cut it. But I wouldn't bank the entirety of the PSVR's future on one game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	How do I alter the controls to stop the motion sickness. What should the controls be set as? I have played around and lost the original settings and now cannot play because of the motion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	I'll get back to you on that. I personally use smooth and set strafe to normal. I'm not prone to motion sickness, though. If you can, play sitting on a swivel chair, or standing. There's a bit of cable management to do, but it means you can play without spinning the view. Also, when you do have to spin the view, either go at a slower pace or even close your eyes. you can also focus on the glove which gives your brain something steady to focus on while spinning.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	Thank you for your help. I have been playing around with the settings and now don't know what default was. I will just have to keep playing and see if I can overcome this. Very expensive to give up.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	Hello! If you don't mind playing standing up, I would really recommend that. It's more immersive and you shouldn't get motion sickness from robinson walking in the direction you're facing. The default controls were pie chart in the turn section, the strafe option on, and horizontal speed correction on. When you start climbing or drop down a ledge, close your eyes as you initiate because the view spins the surface to face the camera!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	Thank you for your reply. I have given up as the motion is bad even after trying to master it for a week. Very expensive experience. Won't download from PlayStation again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/robinson-the-journey-review	@gailwmorris  Too bad :( I had a lot of fun playing the game. I'll probably do another playthrough after Christmas. Are you going to return your headset?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	 Horse Hockey! They did nothing about the aim bots, cheats and the quick scopers.  What a let down.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	I got all the Trophies in this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	I only play the original. I can't waste my money on a game that is mostly identical to the original with a few additions. And you know what they say, graphics don't matter. Not worth 100 bucks, if this wasn't paired with Infinite Warfare then I would buy it. I can't, because I know I can play MW1 in my own bedroom (Free of any perfume, cologne, soap, or sanitizer. I hate any of that stuff) and have the 2007 game. I'd only buy this game if it wasn't paired with Infinite Warfare and was at about 20 bucks. Looks like a great game, paired with a mediocre space shooter. If MW2 remastered comes out this year, make sure it's a standalone game (and make it so that you can get MW2 remastered free, if you have the 2009 game you should be able to upgrade for free) and make sure it has Terminal. Not buying a good remaster of a video game I already own with a poor man's version of Ghosts.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	"This was a great surprise when I played it, It reminded me that this is what CoD is, Not that Infinite or Advanced Warfare.
But jumping online was much the same, campers, campers everywhere!
So my friends and I just do local matches online vs. BOTs and that has been a ton of fun."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	"Game is a complete joke. Good luck if you're looking for casual gameplay, everyone tryhards the fuck out of this game. Filled with sweaty ""veterans"" (LOL). Wanted chilled gameplay and couldn't even fucking move because 99.9% of the players sit in corners and camp like complete bitch-blooded nerds who care only for a pathetic K/D ratio in a 9 year old game. Ruins the game for everyone. 

And by the way, @Raven or whoever developed this trash I paid £80 for, you need to fix the spawns. 70% of the time I spawn in the enemy spawn and get fucked instantly. The other 30% an enemy spawns behind me and kills me instantly. For anyone looking for a chilled, friendly community - STAY AWAY. Still filled with the same toxic people CoD attracts. 

Do yourself a favor - buy BF1. Don't waste £80 on this trash. I'd say it was worth £15 and that's pushing it. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	@Pixalz2000  The spawns are determined by the idiots in your lobby.  If you have idiot teammates who commit to the frontal assault are the ones who flip the spawns.  If you have no strategy, then go play free for all.  Team Deathmatch is for those with a brain.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	Well, it sure beats playing infinite warfare. too bad this wasnt excluded for 29$ then activision would of made bank from it not being included in legacy edition

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	You put out stupid futuristic shooters with auto aim in the game. Why? Because you want to make the games easier for noobs so they will play. Why? SO THAT THEY WILL BUY THE STUPID DLC!! You put out games with about 20% of the content and people will have to buy the rest as DLC later. BUT CHARGE FULL PRICE FOR THE GAME!! This industry has become morally defunct.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	@Pliskin67 huh? modern warfare dlc was free earlier this month. and modern warfare was 20$ valued remastered.10 maps included. also they only have a year to make the game, activision really worked overtime for both games and must release early to progress in lead way and ideas biult off of current updates/patches. they cant just throw games out without bugs, imagine all dlc released at once. it would be horrible huge updates and bugs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	"This was a horrible review. Absolutely horrible. Burnt out buildings and cars amount to a dated map? WTF! This is a real modern warfare setting! WTF happened to shooters!?! Because you can't wall run the game is not exciting? WALL RUNNING IS STUPID AF!!! Remastered is dated because you actually have to take cover and lay suppressive fire or smoke to move?lol That's what you have to do in a modern day warzone!! Unbelievable. I'm not buying infinite warfare which is a dumb game to get Remastered. INFINITE WARFARE IS STUPID! I will not buy into this industry's stupid attempt to ""futurize"" all shooters. And then you STILL PUT AUTO AIM IN THE GAME!?! NO CHALLENGE WHATSOEVER!! I think that feeling she is trying to describe is ""challenge."" She was challenged when playing COD 4 remastered. SOMETHING COD GAMERS HAVE NOT FELT IN A LONG TIME!!!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/08/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-remastered-review	@Pliskin67 My thoughts exactly. We used to spend hours working on strategies back in the day because the levels were NATURAL without fake BS walls and stuff to hide behind.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	 Okay so we have 4k on PS4 now BUT to match it with great sound i have a question: Is it true that if a PS4 game does not have the Dolby Digital or DTS logo it's not encoded in those formats? AND It doesn't have Surround Sound?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	My 1 year old son managed to jam something in my launch PS4 drive. Great timing son! Now I have an excuse to get this!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	Lmao dude my son did the same thing to me a few weeks ago. Little man put the disc shaped cap of a mason jar into it. It was fairly easy to get out using a YouTube guide.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	I was sooooooooo close to buying one this weekend, but I just can't justify spending $300+ for a slightly more powerful machine than my PS4, especially considering I don't have a 4k TV.  Not saying I won't cave in at some point, but for now I'm content playing the waiting game, and seeing what kind of PS4 Pro support games are coming with next year.  I'm not a Microsoft fan after the shitshow that was the XBox 360, but I may very well opt for the Scorpio, depending on the price tag.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	"Hello everyone.

I just got an LG55EB6P 4K amoled and I was really thinking about getting a PS4 Pro, but I am seeing mix feelings towards the console. I do not have the PS4 yet, so that would be my first.

My main reason to get the cheaper PS4 is that I would be able to get 3 games with the price difference, which is interesting, however I would not have the 4K capabilities...

I am looking for suggestion and opinions. PS4 or PS4 pro.
Thanks"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	I think you are all crazy. This PS4 Pro is Awesome!! 4K looks truly amazing!! I am super happy with my purchase!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	It's kinda silly. Regular PS4 has HDR already. The only real difference in the two is 4k/high frame rate modes offered on the Pro. To me that's not early enough to sell my PS4 and get a Pro... As for 4K you can't tell any difference. Higher frame rate is the only real goodie but it's not worth the price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	Can't tell any difference? ...you obviously don't own a 4K tv...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	THANK YOU, best review friend ever... Someone finally speaking that 60 FPS sense. It was the first thing to mind when I heard of PS4 PRO, and is the only reason keeping me from buying one. A lifetime of stop-art animation is enough, I've sampled 60 (Dirt Rally, Dark Souls II, Phantom Pain, Tomb Raider Def Ed, Metro, Last of Us Remastered, CoD AW/BO3/IW, ...) and I just can't go back. Bloodborne at 60@1080, cmon I'd pay 100$ for that goodness.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/ps4-pro-review	The more I contemplate it, the more this feels like every other push in the industry, this one being 4K TV's. It could just be another one of my conspiracy theories. I just don't think it is a lot to ask for upped frame rates for existing games running in HD/1K/1080. Greatness awaits who I ask?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	Here's my honest 6 month late review of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/late-call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	Campaign is ignorable? I just finished the campaign and it was excellent. Probably the most enjoyable since MW2 or BO1. I enjoyed it wayyyy more than BOIII. Epic campaign. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	"Yo this game is.....well.. NOT BAD. I love how i empty a whole clip on a person and they live and kill me with one bullet and i go flying into walls. Im a good player but this game tells me diff. Campaign is really nice but mutilplayer can kiss my bunz 4reaL. Got me playing like i have no skills 
My opinion, BOPIII is better. selling it for 2 tacos and a fish stick"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	I'm not sure why people complain so much. The campaign is pretty damn good! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	look I know people are psycho about multiplayer with COD and such but people, this was one of the best, if not THE best, single player COD campaigns I have ever played.  And I've played them all.  I don't like multiplayer because I suck at it and I can't spend 20 hours a day playing it like these dang teenagers can but I really, really liked the campaign.  The score should be higher, Infinity Ward owned it.    
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	the game is awful multiplayer is cancerous so the campaign and zombies are the only good things in the game and even then the past games had way better campaigns and zombie modes this game is almost as bad as black ops on mobile just with the addition of a supply drop system that the only point is a quick cash grab as it is hard to get keys fast so most players will be urged to buy supply drops for a small chance to get the variant they want
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	"If u want to buy this game people think it's a waste of money. Because people say online players move side by side aka no gravity so players have a good chance to live and miss bullets but went they shoot to kill players they have a good chance to live other players miss the bullets too u might get pissed off because u have a hard time to kill the player(s). On magazine it says it's a great game but they r talking about the campaign not online, people rarely play campaign. At most times most players perfer to play online so that's y the game is a waste of money.
NOTE: c if I'm right if u play this game on your friend(s) (and or play from gamefly).
Ps: shit happens when buying the fucking game"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	"This game was a huge let down for me and my buddies.  We have gone back to #BLOPSIII.  (All these comments are for multiplayer, which lets be honest, is why the majority of people play this franchise once they have completed the campaign, if ever.) I hate that the kill list rolls the opposite direction of ALL PREVIOUS GAMES.  Why did you change that?  It worked fine for years.  It is very difficult to receive that information in a rapid fashion.  By the time I try to decipher who I killed I've probably been shot.  Also, Why is there now no highlight for those in my party?  Big mistake.  How do we run strategy if we can't identify quickly who is in our group?  And the biggest screw up is that there is no co-op campaign!  My best friend lives out of town and playing coop was one of our favorite ways to team up and play.  I haven't played the campaign. In fact after two frustrating sessions of online multiplayer we have yet to go back to IW.  I keep forgetting to return this crappy excuse for a Call of Duty franchise.  We have all reverted to blops3...again.  Sigh.  The challenge for us now is to find a whole new game to play.  I think COD has finally run it's course.  Bummer.
Sad in San Antonio, 
-Kristian"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	I like it but not great
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	"Ignore call of duty 12 year old haters only caring about multiplayer. The campaign was one of the best I have played. Especially if you actually know about the different moons and planets as how they're programmed is very realistic. It's definently a top 3 campaign losing to cod 4 and black ops 1.
The characters were very interesting making you want everyone to survive as you grow to care for them, specifically Ethan, I can't say anything about multiplayer yet but I assure you the campaign is worth it (if you're an adult and like good stories)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	@mattdagroove  yes, what he ^ said.  Campaign is soooo good.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/07/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review	"@mattdagroove  The story is not good at all. In fact it doesn't even make any sense. How does Reyes know how to command an entire ship spaceship with no training? Why does the SDF break up its fleet when it could have stuck together or at least travelled in groups? Why does it only have one level were the dangers of space are actually relevant, and even then only for part of it?

The plot its self started well admittedly but then feel apart as it basically turned into a large scale game of hide and seek with the enemy fleet. The only character worth remembering is Ethan and even then he only appears good because all of the other characters are stale serotypes.

The level design for the missions were okay at best.

See for me Black ops 1 had the best Cod campaign, it was filled with mystery, each mission had a unique environment, the characters were good and believable and (along with many other things) it had some good Easter eggs to make it even more fun. Infinite warfare had none of that (yes I have read that you said Black Ops 1 had a better campaign if you were wondering).

Infinite Warfare had nothing special going for it (except being in space, which wasn't even fun). Personally it is the one of the worst video game campaigns I have ever played (and I have played some shit games). It has bad characters, only decent maps, and frankly nothing is explained (unless you want to read through some boring emails) to you. On top of all that it is far too easy, I completed it on veteran with ease. The hardest difficulty should actually be hard, I can't even imagine how easy recruit most be."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	Just dived back in. I'm loving it again. I have put too many hours on all versions to be liking it this much.Skyrim stoned is just brilliant no matter what system. (Bar the ps3 that was horrid)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	Read my honest 3 year late review of Skyrim @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/pc/late-elder-scrolls-skyrim-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	@TheLateGamer Nope
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	"Apologize for posting two times in a row- however, I would like to retract my previous review of Skyrim. Almost immediately after writing it, I said, ""Oh, fuck it, I'll complete this first Thieves Guild Quest"", and slowly but surely, the game completely turned around for me, and I started to get it. 

Since then, Skyrim has become incredibly engrossing and addicting, to a point that I almost feel ashamed of it(I don't want to spend every breathing moment playing games!). I wanted to leave my previous post up though, because I felt that a lot more people might stick with Skyrim a little longer, if they saw that (for me-at least) the game DOES get better, and that even in a post-witched III world, Skyrim still stands apart as a unique and enthralling experience.

I think the hardest thing to get out of my head was the aimlessness I felt after doing a few of the main quests, which really did seem quite lame. After killing my first dragon I suddenly had about 15 side quests thrown at me, had no money to get a horse, and was losing patience going out 'exploring'. 

However, it turns out that this 'aimlessness' is actually what makes Skyrim such a cool game, because you can become whoever you want to be which is one thing The Witcher didn't allow for."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	"Word of warning: you cannot switch the DLCs off in this game. This means that once you hit level 10, the vampires from Dawnguard DLC start appearing whenever you enter town, and start killing important folk such as traders, trainers, side quest givers or whoever happens to be there.
This is pain in the butt, as the only way to prevent these deaths is to avoid towns after level ten, and immediately complete the Dawnguard DLC once you have hit level 10 (start by heading to Riften). After completion of the Dawnguard DLC, those vampires should stop spawning in towns.
Why did Bethesda leave these game breaking vampire attacks to the DLC? They ruin the whole game, and they know it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	@Classicnerd Thx for the heads up. Fixing to buy this game. Haven't played it since 2012, and none of the DLC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	"Here's my review. I think the coloring and overall quality has improved, but the glitches are still there, but manageable. There is a funny glitch where if you save the game while you're on a horse, and reload it, you begin to lose friction and you start floating all over the place. I like the quicksave option, I think that is a plus, but still the same game.

Also, Elder Scrolls fans, if you are waiting for the new Elder Scrolls, just be patient. If you demand for the new Elder Scrolls right now, you're gonna get what you wait for. I would rather wait 5 to 7 years for a masterpiece than wait a month or 2 for some really cheap throw-together-to-make-a-quick-buck game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	This game is full of glitches,and unsatisfactory gameplay. Keep in mind that I have not played any previous Skyrim games, but this one is awful. Graphics are subpar, character development is lacking, questing is challenging when you have to travel monotonously back and forth. I give this a C-
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	Great job Bethesda on fixing those glitches just restarted game again..... Upgrade sucks not worth buying!! Lazy coders!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	Besides the mods, is there any difference between the PS4 or Xbox version.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	I disagree with the verdict! I am more drawn into this than I ever was with Witcher 3 and Skyrim original. Sure I agree its a cash cow, but it brought me back to skyrim and I am enjoying every moment. Also bought it on black Friday for half-price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	@scipio1st I paid 39$ for my copy because I'm a sucker for Steelbox cases. Plus, you know, that hat is pretty dope (/s).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	Graphics aren't that different from the original.  The game deserves the same score as the original though or slightly hire.  All they had to do was advise in the review there's no point in owners of the original to buy this 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-special-edition-review	"@GlesgaBoy87 I think that depends. I played the original on a console, so the benefits truly secured a purchase in my shoes.

Definitely not the same mentality if I happened to play this on PC though."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"I was a Hitman fan and I hated the episodic approach. My skills numbed through the months, since I had to re learn every control every episode. (Im sorry I can only retain the control distribution of 3 games at all times) I also felt cheated, other Hitman games had many many more campaign missions (20 for Absolution, for instance) While this one only 6. SIX! wth? and at full price. Besides the terrible loading screens. I'm the kind of player who makes her missions as perfect silent assassin. So, if I screw up, I restart the mission. And it was hell to wait on those red screens.

Either way, this game is BS with making me wait a year to only get 6 crappy missions, after paying full price. 
They disappointed me,I feel cheated. I have all Hitman games but, I'm never going to buy one again."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"Loved this level. It took me a long time the first play through to figure out how to take care of the hospitalized target ugh.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"I don't agree at all with this review, although I agree with most reviews about the episodes.

In the end I enjoyed this entry of hitman, although the hate it got and the average to bad music and voice acting.

Anyway, this is my top episodes list: 1. Spianze (Ep.2).
2. Colorado (Ep. 5).
3. Paris (Ep. 1).
4. Hokkaido (Ep. 6).
5. Bangkok (Ep. 4).
6. Marrakesh (Ep. 3)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"""The end result has been slightly uneven (the season began with a strong pair of missions but subsequent episodes were never quite able to match them)""

Would this be in a review if the game wasnt released as episodic content. In every previous Hitman game some mission were better than the others. But the whole package as a game were great. This is way it just makes it seem like you need to skip buying certain episodes because they are not as good as the 2 starting ones, at least thats the feeling i get.

And with this season 1 ending thing it means there could be season 2 or even 3 which makes me think, should i wait until all seasons are out and done so i can just buy best missions from all the seasons they release."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"@BrutalDoom If you want to wait years to even play it I guess you could go that route, although, there's a chance that as the seasons pass older seasons will get severely discounted and repachaged with the new ones and it could be the same price to buy a handful of the ""good"" episodes or just get a package deal on the whole thing.

Some episodes are definitely better than others but even the weaker ones add variety and more content to play. My least favorite is the Colorado episode but even that one is unique, has four targets instead of two, it has the best sniping (although Sapienza is a close second in that regard), it's got the toughest escalation contract, and it's got peaches (yay!). Plus, if you're missing any episodes you miss out on elusive contracts that utilize they levels in new ways and if you're playing on PS4 you won't be able to do all the contracts for The Sarajevo Six if you're missing content."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"I'm just about finished with Hitman: Absolution on 360.

I definitely want to get this season of Hitman. I just wanted to wait until every episode was available (and maybe discounted) before purchasing. I hate episodic releases. Telltalle games are somewhat of an exception imo though.

Anyway, I'm looking to build a PC early next year. I know this game has an unlocked framerate on console. I own a PS4 atm, and am wondering if I'd be cheating myself by getting it on PS4. Or, if I should just wait like I am with Dishonored 2 and Watch Dogs 2 on PC.

My minimum spec would be an i5 6600k w/ an RX 480 or GTX 1060
My goal is i7 6700k (7700k or AMD Zen dependent on release) and an GTX 1070."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	I find the gameplay mechanics to be very shallow in this game. Also the AI never actually allows you to immerse yourself because it's too  game-y to be honest. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	@lunatic4ever Shallow? Compared to what? Moving a reticle around with a left joystick and pulling the right trigger when you move something to the center of your tv screen like most of the really popular games?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"I think it's time for a Reboot. Maybe Agent 69...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	@nicotinic cool idea. Also they really need to up the gameplay mechanics. Absolution easily had the better gameplay mechanics as far as shooting and sneaking went, although i prefer the style of game that the latest one was.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"@SnarkyCarnt @nicotinic I disagree. Shooting mechanics were always a minor thing in 'Hitman' games and a thing you should avoid anyway, so I don't care very much that those were better in 'Absolution'. And about the sneaking mechanics, I don't thing that those in 'Absolution' were better than the current one, they look the same to me. No, to me the gameplay in the current 'Hitman' game is the ideal gameplay a 'Hitman' game should have, and coupled with an 'opportunities' mechanic and challenges that encourage multiple play through, it's the ultimate 'Hitman' experience that fans of the franchise didn't get in
'Absolution' "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	@itay169 @SnarkyCarnt @nicotinic the animations definitely need work at least. How it snaps to dumping the bodies for example is jarring. Also the voice over work was poor. It may be a minor thing but it had a huge impact in taking you out of the experience when everyone in italy sounded american.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	@SnarkyCarnt @itay169 @nicotinic I completely agree, but since for me gameplay is the most important thing in a game, I was able to overcome its faults (I had the most trouble with the 'English in an American accent all over the world' thing).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"@nicotinic Even after 16 years and 6 titles, I still love agent 47 and wouldn't want somebody else to take his place. The cool silent killer personality and iconic voice from the same voice actor in all of this years, I just can't get tired of it. Sure, an operative who fully disguises herself would make more sense, but since when making sense had a hold in video games? Style beats making sense anytime.  

However, I don't care if we could play a different operative in some of the missions if it would spice thing up"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	"Normally a new Hitman game would be a day one buy for me; but because of this episodic approach, I'm just not excited about it, this is causing the game look cheap. I can understand why Telltale games is doing it, as they're more like ""here, play an episode and if you like where the story is going, pay to see the rest"" and it works! But Hitman is already a popular franchise with a rather large fan base, so I just can't see why would they kill all the hype it could create."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/11/01/hitman-episode-6-hokkaido-review	@m92 The episodic approach actually works with Hitman. It actually gives you an incentive to go back to each of the levels and complete the different ways on killing your targets and completing various challenges. Had they released it all in one package, there is tons of stuff and details what you would of missed.

Titanfall 1 is much better, but T2 is not worth the money. It seems to have been slapped together quickly to meet deadlines and just dumped in the marketplace way too early.

The biggest problem ha something to do with tic time, and what that is, I am not to sure about, but when I look my issue, it is what everyone is complaining about.

You see the game has an issue of you being hit and killed in a spit second not knowing you were ever being shot at let alone who, until the replay, where you discover you have been getting shot out for several sevconds by a guy standing directly in front of you. It is now May of 2017 and apparently respawn is not going to fix this problem."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	@swwwwwwww I agree. The enemy can appear out of no where, shoot around 90 degree corners and shoot though buildings.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	@TheWalkingBase Wasn't expecting the single player campaign to be sooo good. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	On my part, considering those were the guys who brought us Medal of Honor Allied Assault (best MoH IMO) and Call of Duty 2 and 4 (best CoD IMO), I was impatient to play their first full fledged single player campaign in years, wasn't disapointed (well, it was to short :p ).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	"Played the very enjoyable campaign twice, and then dived into the glorious multiplayer.
I thought DOOM was 2016's best shooter, and then this came along.
Respawn, you exuberant geniuses."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	"@Deadstark97  I'm a little late to the party with some of these titles cause I had to repurchase a PS4 recently and missed well over a year of many great titles, but glad I trusted Titanfall 2 reviews of the single player campaign. I'm 1/2 through now and its just a plain fun FPS. Seems like the truly aging CoD campaign formula needs to take some notes here. But in CoD defense, last of their Campaigns that i sat through and enjoyed were M. Warware 1, and maybe Black Ops 1. 
Can't wait to try Doom '16."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	"@nrp16 @Deadstark97 DOOM (2016) is also an excellent shooter. In fact I personally enjoyed it's campaign just a little more than TF2's.
But the divide in quality between MP is enormous. Titanfall 2 is one of the best MP experiences on the market, and overall is the more well rounded game of the two."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	Just picked it up for $24 bucks from the PSN deal and my god.. It's so fucking fun! I cannot believe I didn't pick this up sooner.. Totally worth it guys!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	I love this frickn' game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	Not since COD:MW have I had this much fun with an fps campaign. Great job respawn, this was a helluva ride!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	@BeknIghted Definitely a great game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	"I enjoy playing this game except for the maddening ""walk on walls"" ridiculousness. It totally kills gameplay and seems like a programmer indulgence. We get it. You can can walk on walls and jump. Don't make this overdone feature an impediment to continuity. I can't recommend this game because of it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	@gamer2737 Interesting point of view. I feel it actually complements the solid gameplay. It's another tactic to use.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	Bought this over the weekend man am i loving this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	@shoxsnake88 A solid FPS.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	I bought the Xbox one Battlefield 1/Titanfall 2 bundle for 75 dollars over the holidays. Best gaming investment I've made in a while. I've played both, but Titanfall 2 is by far my favorite out of the two
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review	@VETO_MEGA Titanfall 2 is awesome!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	Bad bad game... Story mode stops too much during the fights. Characters are not what I expected. The games gets borring with so many pauses in the fights and the fact that I hate the most is that my character (or the character you choose) doesn't have a voice, they didn't bother to put a voice in the character your are playing with. Plain and not interesting plot. For me is 3.5/10 and I'm been nice because I love Dragon Ball Z
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	people out there who love fighting games then this MIGHT be for you. i personally like fighting games but, when i finished the game , the game freaking glitched and a lost all my progress. what the fudge is this crap. and the fly mechanics to go upward when locked on to a enemy are so dumb and lazily programmed. you move sideways and 1 cm up and then the enemy attacks you. overall this could be a good fighting game if there weren't so many glitches. and also sometimes the game just abruptly crashes (most of the time while you are playing a story mission) so if you are okay with or are used to glitches then this game might be for you with an okay story. at least it's better than no man's sky. the game may look like it has no glitches but thats just a trick because it will crash, literally at the times when you are focused in battle and forget about the glitches . the story is okay and the combat could be good if the upward flying mechanics while locked on were so crazy. I used to play a dragon ball game ( Boudokai Tenkachi 2 & 3) in the wii with my brother when i was little and that was so much better than this. it gave you actual fun and momentum to focus on the battle and fight alongside allies that ... words cannot explain it. SO play this game only if u r used to glitches and are gud with crazy upward flying mechanics that make no sense and that if u r at level 80 then money starts being useless . i give this game a 6 and would never give it a 7.5 rating because that is too high for a sucky game. im rating it a six because at least its not as bad as no man's sky which got a 5. its a little bit near no man's sky tho .  this game should be worth at least maximum 40 dollars and not 60 dollars cause that is some sh*t.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	Dragon ball xenoverse 2 is the worst game invented in dragon ball history, i loved the idea of playing xenoverse 1 when it came out because it gave you the opportunity to fight alongside goku & the other z warriors, & also create your own character, perfect sounding game right? so i bought it, played it, loved the story, then i got more into it and started playing player matches, endless battles, and mostly ranked matches, and became very high up on the score boards. THE absolute main reason i loved this game is because of the combat, the fact that you had to be patient and watch your opponents move, perfect block it, take your time, make them look like their week even tho their trying so hard. It was an absolutely great game especially for that reason, now on to the reason that xenoverse 2 is so not worth your time or money, in xenoverse 2, 90 percent of the same idea of xenoverse 1 is duplicated in xenoverse 2, the story mode is almost identical which is repetitive and very boring, #2 xenoverse 2 combat style smh, & i cant stress this enough, the combat style has been brought down to a mediocre level, its straight up attack as fast as you can and break guards, and blast blast ki blast and die, especially with the added flight attacks that are almost impossible to block, its such a downgrade, its no longer fun, its becoming like one of those games that someone with no knowledge of games can just press buttons on and win the battle, i would never give this game a 7.5 star rating, especially compared to xenoverse 1, xenoverse 2 deserves a 2 star rating and thats being generous, i would of hoped for a xenoverse 3 but after seeing xenoverse 2 i can only imagine what else will be ruined, & dont get me wrong im a huge dragon ball z fan so you gotta understand my frustration, theres much more on this topic that i didnt even get into, but ill just leave it at that, ill just stick to watching the dragon ball super series, & i also have a few complaints about that too, i dont want to see anymore side episodes, i dont watch dbz to see them play baseball or be corny, i love the action and villains the brutal fights, but thats for another day, i know im not the only one that feels this way about this topic & if not lets see if we can make a change, peace
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	"i have xbox1 ,can i play it with my brother in campaign mode & online ?
2 players split screen or anything !!!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	You know what really pisses me off about this game, there is STILL random loop drop the flying in this game makes me feel like a dumbass because I can never get my fucking character to fly properly for crying out loud I knew this game was going to be the same as the first, because it only took them a year after the first xenoverse came out!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	I wanna buy this but been putting it off cause of dishonored 2 hmm what to do
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	If I have the first DBX, should I honestly spend money to buy the 2nd?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	@Alex06 not unless you are a huge fanboy. This game has a lot of fanboy followers but you can tell it will be dying out quick so if you want 2-4 months of fun then buy it. No guarantee there will be more than 4 months of fun with this, but the 4 months will definitely be fun. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	I haven't enjoyed a DBZ game since Raging Blast 2. My fav will always be Budokai Tenkaichi 3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	@10yearoldgenius Yes to this statement. We need another one that plays like these, with all of the characters from Dragonball through GT/Super.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	And the visuals still look like an early-PS3/supercharged-PS2 game. Way to raise the bar, DBZ games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/dragon-ball-xenoverse-2-review	THis game is amazing and def in the top 3 DBZ games ever made.  My son hates dbz and loves FPS and plays this more than any FPS that just came out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	60 hours, yeah, no. I'm almost at the end with little more than a day and a half of gameplay. At that includes some grinding.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	@hellfire759 haha no
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	@maddogtannen316 @hellfire759  hellfire what do you mean, I am at 40 hours with the true ending done, all interventions, and miniventures. Unless you are including post game dungeons as part of the game?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	Best final fantasy since 9. My favorite ps4 game yet. Cant wait for the next one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	I'm loving this game. Training all my mirages is fun, though it gets to be a little annoying that no matter what combination I use, I can eventually beat tough enemies if I gain a few levels. It would've been nice to see more strategic play, maybe the ability to change between jiant and liliken stacks mid-battle, more reason to be unstacked, etc. Some of the necessary menus are very hidden, too. Still, I wouldn't give it less than an 8.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	"Not having so many useless area to explore is actually why I loved this game.
Cutting straight to the point. There no need to visually impress me with glimmering cities or dungeons in this chibi world. This game is laid back, cute, and most importantly, fun."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	The game's easy overall, but it brings nostalgic feelings and it looks gorgeous ! It's more FF than FFXV, which received 8.2 despite being cheap easy with unpolished story. I took huge beasts that could kill me with a single hit without much of strategy, all I had to do was mashing, using potions and phoenix down. I don't understand why they complained about the combat of WoFF, it's a JRPG and it's FF what do they expect ? The biggest con IMO is the difficulty level.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	"I love this game. I bought a vita 2 weeks back and the guy recommended this so I decided why not. It's basically Pokémon with a FF spin
It's addicting to play"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	Where's the FFXV review you hacks?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	@HotTap I'm pretty sure that review came out a few weeks ago.

pass

WE DONT WANT CUTE.... maybe thats why VII was arguably the best FF ,,,sometimes the best ps1  game.... "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	"What was cute about ff6, 8, 9, 10?
If you want to go on FFVII you had cloud fall into mako and Tifa sit by his side while he recovers and helps put him back together. That's cute and the moment they share.
Your cute comment doesn't make sense. Plus I wouldn't say FF7 is the best I grew up only playing FF7. It wasn't till ffx I played my second final fantasy and then years ago 8 and 9. And recently 6, I think 6 is the best imo. But 7 is my personal favourite."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	Cait sith, cactaurs, mogs, chocobos, fat chocobos, yufi, the golden disk date scene. And ff9 was one of the cutest games ever. Ff6 had lots of cute also. Ff has always been both cute and dark. And world of ff has some really darkstuff too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	All the people who decided not to bother probably done themselves a favor.  I played around 80 hours and got to the last dungeon.  By now the combat is very tedious and i ended up giving up when i found out how many back to back boss fights i had to play in order to just get the first ending.  Oh well i just hope FF XV doesnt suck this much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	Take it you don't like Pokémon games then
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	@gfunkology I quite liked the digimon game, somehow raising them wasnt such a chore as it was in World of FF or at least it didnt feel like it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	@XaviX @gfunkology digimon is not pokemon
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/world-of-final-fantasy-review	"`Not a huge FF fan, I havent played everyone except 7 and 10. But I am very much an avid rpg player both jrpg which I think are getting pretty bad lately and western rpgs.. 
I had pre ordered this game before I read this and reading it worried me.. but after picking the game up I could not let it go.. it was very entertaining the only point of critique I could have is the storyline perhaps but even that was really great twist if you finished the game postscript. 
The game looks wonderful, cute and vibrant with a gameplay that lets you experiment and grow the monsters you like. Its very addictive and the monster battles are  also fun. Star Ocean 5 was pretty bad imo.. I finished it and it got a 7,5 from IGN let me tell you.. this game deserves atleast 2 points more than whatever Star ocean 5 got.. 

Pick this one up if you like rpgs especially if you appreciate rewarding leveling system with so many abilities and monsters. This game is awesome I loved it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	"I don't know why people get so offended when ""motion sickness"" is a part of the review. If only one thing was worth mentioning it would be that. In a ""NO REFUNDS"" closed market run by Sony it's the one bit of information anybody needs. The rest is just fluff. If you don't get sick then great. Play the game and enjoy it. This review will do nothing to stop you from doing that. It's time the gaming community gets it act together and stops treating reviews of games they like as if the reviewer was insulting their mother and they needed to vigorously defend her."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	@Lionheartwolf135 I think you're missing the point. Motion sickness isn't a problem if it's mentioned as a passing warning where the reviewer admits they simply don't have the stomach of rit. But blaming the game for motion sickness, and having it affect the tone of the review or score, is a problem. It's like reviewing a concert negatively because somebody spilled a drink on you and you had to watch the whole show with wet pants. It's a commentary that has nothing to do with the game if you are someone who doesn't get motion sick.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	"If he was experiencing motion sickness, he shouldn't have reviewed the game. 

I get zero motion sickness from this game and I think it's super badass ! It does an excellent job of making you feel like your a genuine part of your mech and the feeling that your competing in a real sport. The weapon aiming with the headset is perfect. I had trouble finding things I didn't like about the game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	this is an interesting detail about reviewing VR games. The motion sickness that some people get when playing is sure to turn them off from the game, however, how do you, as a reviewer, get past that and judge a game for people who DON'T get motion sickness?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	"I dont suffer motion sickness but for the first few sessions I felt slight sensations of it. however they subsided to nothing after a while, most people I know that have tried it for say 30 seconds then declared ""it's just making me feel sick"" are missing out in my eyes."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	The Psvr experience is like a 12 year old who only ever knew the Atari upgrading to a ps10 for the 1st. Time. The experience is that groundbreaking. Every game released from this point forward should have a vr counterpart. Trying to get back into battlefield 1 is like trying to get back into the wii for most gamers. It's that jarring.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	@MountaineerMania Yeah, I mean... I just got mine yesterday and I'm having a hard time understanding why VR isn't more a watershed for people. The Playroom Robot Rescue mission is astonishing on a way that Mario 64 was astonishing. It completely changes the view of what's possible and what's expected out of games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	IGN, I've pretty much lost all respect for you. The PS VR is amazing, and you've played you're cards completely wrong. I'm right on the edge of just being done with you completely.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	Dude played the tutorial, watched some YouTube videos, and wrote a review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	@alucard2003 well to be fair, his motion sickness was too acute to let him play the game...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	@psychorobotninja @alucard2003 Then he shouldn't be reviewing the game...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	@flervin @psychorobotninja @alucard2003 ha, well yeah - i was being facetious
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	This trash piece is just one glaring reason why people don't think that IGN reviews are reliable. 2 weeks late and as with every single exclusive to PS4(and all of the VR launch titles) the score is way below the meta average. IGN has gone out of their way to discredit PSVR and it's launch lineup. People can throw out all of the tin foil hat remarks they want, but this site is absolutely bought and fucking paid for. MS exclusives have been higher than the meta average for quite some time now. Like literally every single one, and on the flip side of that PS exclusives have been scored below the meta average every single time. That's not some strange coincidence, it's shady business and to deny that as a possibility is being ignorant.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	@Big-Bacon this place is the worst of the worst of the worst in terms of an industry/editor revolving door of favors.  Between all the perks IGN employees get for their reviews that read like native adds?  Who can blame them?  There is no oversight for this type of rigged system that serves both entities, beyond moral journalism?  good luck
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	what are you even on about? nonsense, you don't agree so it must be a conspiracy?? do you honestly kknow how you sound? you and others alike.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/rigs-mechanized-combat-league-review	It's funny. The training level made me feel sick. I shrugged it off and turned all the vr settings on to max, turning with headset on. Still maintain this is a good game. If it wasn't a vr title the 6.5 would be OK. This is a lot of fun though and sure the graphics aren't amazing. Worth buying vr for? No. Vr itself is the killer app and that makes this a 7.5 easy.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	I thought that Ariandel was DS3's strongest area yet. My character was at level 200 or so when I went in to the expansion, so I expected to have an easier time than most -- and I suppose I did. But There's more to Dark Souls than challenge; the level design, boss fights, new weapons, environments, and lore additions are awesome. Like I said, I can't think of a pre-existing area in DS3 that was as impressive to me. I feel like this DLC is getting a somewhat negative rap for not fixing all of the issues that players had with the core game, and that seems totally unfair. There are a TON of fixes / improvements / new ideas I'd like to see fully fleshed out in the next DLC. But for now, I really appreciate the addition of this new content. I've learned not to care so much about insurmountable challenge in the Souls series, as much as fine-tuned mechanics, and the awesome ability to craft a character from RPG sinew that I can then take to a street fighter arena.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	For this price point this DLC is not worth it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	"I hope they release GOTY edition of DS3 that includes these DLCs. On the disc. For us who do not have fast internet for donwloading stuff like this. 
And BTW I do not get the complains about this. This DLC looks better than the actual game, so you should be happy!"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	"@quickshooter not to mention the dlc is 100% fanservice, there's not an ounce of originality in it (or ds3 in general). i mean they actually named it ""painted world""! ds3 is still an enjoyable game, probably more for newcomers than for long-time fans, but it lacks so much creativity and innovation and instead is almost completely based on nostalgia. it's definitely good that this is the last dark souls."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	It's all worth while once you get into the great new PvP... If you don't PvP I'm sorry for you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	"too much nostalgia. in both ds2 and 3 the games are basically about how great and legendary the 1st DS was. In ds2 that's also pretty much every dialogue of every npc (they're basically all saying ""dude DS was so great, why are you playing this?""). instead of focussing on making new great games/ideas/lore. why is anor londo in ds3? it could never get close to the anor londo in ds. it's short, disappointing (all those ways you could go in DS that you can't in DS3), same as this dlc.""painted world"" seriously??? why not make something new instead of these bad clones of worlds and characters that have been better? i never understood why from put so much effort into comparing ds2 and 3 to ds, when they could've just made the games have their own originality. doesn't speak for creativity."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	@RaveNRolla oh my god man, thank you so much for this comment. While I felt DS3 is so much better than DS2 (it felt empty without Miyazaki being directly involved), I was a little letdown with the game. Mechanically it's great, pretty memorable boss fights, and it's damn beautiful, but man, I'm glad the series is supposedly over so it doesn't officially run into the ground. I don't know why, but I was expecting the same level of innovation and experimentation with dark souls 2 as we got in the leap from Demon's Souls to Dark Souls 1. Then, Dark Souls 3, comes out and it's basically fan service to dks players, and lacks a lot of mechanical creativity that made the series so great in the first place, but demon's and dks1 most likely set the bar so high for me, that my expectations could have never been met.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	Indeed, I felt this way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	Welcome to Suplex City!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	"too many bonfires, I've already found 5 or 6 in a few hours. There should have maybe been 2 or 3. Also it's not really all that challenging, I died only 3 times on the way to the keeper and the wolf boss. I'm in NG+ and only level 110(chose my most under leveled save) and I'm still 1 or 2 shotting most of the enemies. 

It's still fun and seems like it'll end up being decent enough length without the PvP to warrant 1/2 of my 18 dollar season pass but I would have welcomed a tougher challenge. The weapons and spells I've picked up this far are kinda lackluster as well I kinda just want another baldur swag sword again tho, I've been missing it's moveset since DS1."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	Make it harder yourself, right? Isn't that part of the charm? Play naked ( in the game preferably) with a broken dagger perhaps. I hear you about the Baldur Sword though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	"Nevermind that was the whole DLC minus the boss fights. 2-3 hours to light all bonfires and grab every weapon, spell and shield without even trying... 

The bosses were decent but the over abundance of bonfires made this way too easy... 7 bonfires. I understand not wanting to chase people away that suck at gaming but please don't make me handicap myself in order to find a challenge. I'm already way under leveled for NG+ and playing near no armor fashion Souls."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/24/dark-souls-3-ashes-of-ariandel-review	"I think if you are not into PvP this DLC will be a bit of bummer due to the PvE content. The Arena is a welcomed and much needed addition to the game. 

In Regards to the PvE content it's certainly among the worst From has Done. However it is still pretty cool, the new spells are a bit of a mixed bag but the new weapons are Sweet. The new enemy types like the Milkwood Vikings were certainly for me more challenging to deal with than anything in the base game. (Weapon art spamming gits).

Optional Boss is pretty meh but Sister Friede is the Highlight of this DLC for sure.
A mix of Ornstein and smough, Priscilla and Lady Maria rolled into one. 
I think most of the time was spent attempted to defeat her than going through the levels. Cool Boss and Exhausting to fight.

Seeing as these are the last bit of content From is doing for Dark Souls possibly EVER. I just expected a more meaty send off."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	"What i wanted to see was a realistic WW1 game full of the unique and incredible feeling my great great grandfathers felt, lived and fought for, i wanted to see soldiers charging from trenches into enemy lines coverd by artillery fire, tanks and airplanes, what i have seen is a more like WW2-modern combat style full of blacks and women (russian army) wich in reality would be less 1% than the actual forces and less than 1% death, yet in the game there are 25% women in the russian army and over 50% blacks in the british american french and german armies (even the cavalry is black for the germans), also the weapons are far form historical accurate, instead of using real weapons of ww1 they use prototypes and weapons that were not even used in actual combat. The gameplay was extremly fun in the beta for me so i bought the game yet the game began to be extremly repetitive nothing new and if you want something new you have to pay more and more cash.
Good Job for destroying history, destroying the respect you should have shown to white males that died in the war (omg so offensive statement) and destroying one of the best ever games you could have created."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	"This may seem like nitpicking but the facial character model for T.E. Lawrence is atrocious. Looks absolutely nothing like the man. Ruined the ""Nothing is Written"" mission for me."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	"Honestly, this game was actually great when it first launched. But right now it's... Absolute trash! I'm not sure if DICE
consciously put stubborn cretins in charge of this game to kill it ASAP or they simply don't realize how incompetent they are, but this game was going downhill from the get-go. Patch after patch, every single one of their updates was slicing off a big chunk of player base. Their ""moment of glory"" happened two months ago when they decided to ""fix"" something noone ever asked to fix - the netcode. According to devs new netcode should punish everyone with >100 ping. WHY? Why would you ever punish your own players? For what reason? They also fvcked up and that update screwed up EVERYONE not just high-pingers. Your shots are randomly not registered, you can teleport around the map, all kinds of bugs are happening every single game poisoning the game. Any other normal dev team would've reverted that patch ASAP and apologize, but this team is only making things worse trying to fix their fix for months already.
The game is on it's deathbed right now. It's been 8 months since the game launched and the only new content is a couple of ""new""(rehashed) guns and a few generic maps that have 0 players. I have a minimum of 200 ping to the closest server where I can actually find enough player to start a match. Next DLC is released in august so there won't be new content for a while and I don't even think I will be able to play it since the game is pretty much dead already."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	"The PC version of this game is a waste of money and time. If you have got an i5 or lower you are forced to play on the lowest possible settings in multiplayer, and even then it struggles to keep up with 60 fps. If you want to play this at decent settings, you are forced to buy an expensive i7. 
The gameplay also sucks. Every pistol is stronger then other weapons, there is a serious lack of weapons, a few different per class, and thats it. 

DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PIECE OF CRAP!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	To this day I still try to compare any battlefield to battlefield bad company 2 and unfortunately nothing will live up to the excitement of the 2nd game of the series.  That being said, Battlefield One has been the closest to the benchmark.  The big different between the two is that Bad Company 2 had such a better progression system.  My knock on BF1 is the lack of available guns.. Not much separation between the guns..  and that some of the later guns are poo..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	I love this game it is one of the best u need to get it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	This game is a waste of time ...time being the operative word Fucking thing take forever to load and play ...second the game play is terrible and the pistols outdo any other fucking weapon .....this game is a waste of time..... 2/10 max 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	This game has more bugs than a lot of Alpha Tests I have participated in. Don't waste your money.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	That is anachronistic to represent segregated black units in combat roles - Blacks served in supply units during the war, and the great majority never saw combat, while some did, to focus on the extreme minority is obviously political and pandering in nature..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	@LikkerdySplit yo famalam, you might wanna look up your WW1 history. many blacks served in front line combat, not with white american troops tho cause you guys were assholes at the time, they served with the French
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	Would this be hard to jump into the multiplayer at this point? Thinking about buying the game, know I'm late to the party 😭
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	@Liberalredneckgamer I just picked it up on Monday and there's definitely a learning curve. That's how it is with all Battlefields though since it's 32 v 32. It just takes 2-3 hours of play to finally start getting the hang of it and then you'll be fine.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/21/battlefield-1-review	"@Liberalredneckgamer i just started playing last week, it's pretty fun if you don't expect to be the number 1 guy every match. i don't care if i suck lol.

beware though -  there are way too many hackers - sometimes the second i spawn i get killed instantly"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	Hmm the review has me doubting a purchase , but the demo on PSN has me loving it. The car felt real and everything felt great but the review kind of says the opposite. So I'm perplexed that the review here and my opinions of the demo can be so different
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"I couldn't put my finger on why playing this didn't actually make it feel like you're sitting in a car, but I think it's got something to do with the artificial perspective shifts Luke describes and the fact that it feels more like you're wearing a big sumo-like ""car costume"" than actually sitting in one in Drive Club. The car frame appears to be directly tethered to the player's view, when in fact it should feel like an object you sit in and that reacts to the road rather than just to your ""camera."" Games like Eve Valkyrie get the cockpit look and feel right. It just never clicked for me with this one."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	Eve looks great on psvr and you can see things clear far way I think the problem is driveclub not being optimized for psvr well let's hope GT turns out well
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	I dont trust ign too much on racing games reviews. Racing games take the right person to test for certain aspects racing fans look for and i dont believe anyone at ign are true racers
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@gamersbitchtoomuch I don't mean to single you out but I just want to stress that racing is my favourite genre. Have you read or watched much racing content on IGN over the past five years? Because I've written a lot of it and I'd certainly hoped I'd made it clear I'm an earnest fan of all kinds of racing games.

If it helps, here's an old shot of the custom cockpit I built for myself and the one I made for my son and daughter; it's an old pic (they're painted and have decals now) but it's the only one I have on my phone. We take racing games very seriously at my house, I promise!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	@Luke_Reilly_AU @gamersbitchtoomuch dope rigs. i was basing off of the few reviews ive seen from others. my opinion was just different
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	Did you play this game in 3rd person view behind the car at all? I found that the best way to play, especially online.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@Luke_Reilly_AU @gamersbitchtoomuch
That is ridiculously awesome"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	That's pretty epic, also I would like to say that I think the only other sites I trust for Racing Game reviews are Top Gear and Jalopnik, keep up the good work Luke :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	And.......this is why PC is the only place for proper VR.  the PS4 just isnt up to it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	@Cinematic30fps In all fairness they started off with the handicap of trying to make a VR game out of a decidedly average racer in the first place... for all it's good looks the original game was bland and uninspired.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	@TTDog666 And here's another
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@swiss34 Another true comment... sure... and another comment from yourself aimed solely at people who say negative comments about anything PS4... which hardly add anything to the conversation.
I played a ton of Driveclub, got the platinum trophy and worked through some of the expansions... it's a dull racer at best... so calm yourself down and maybe look at your own posting habits before attacking other peoples."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@TTDog666 I like to pick out the weeds, and they are easy to spot on IGN.  People who solely have nothing positive to say about the PS4.  As a mod you are a weed more visible that grows taller.  My comments are nothing but retorts to those poisoning this community. Question my posting habits all you want, you are so transparent you can't even see yourself.  

Plus I call BS on your Platinum.  Who would spend all that time on such a ""dull racer""?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@swiss34 Yet you claim to know so much about my posting... but have failed to check my gaming history or my PSNID (same name as on here, save you having to think) to see for yourself.

All you're doing is making yourself look foolish."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	Well Driveclub was always an awful game - and still is (and yes I have it). I was really interested to see how this would equate to VR however as the PS4 just doesn't have the power to run AAA titles in VR. That's not bashing the PS4, I own one, but it's just a fact that the PS4 wasn't made for VR and doesn't have the horsepower to run stuff like this and make it look how I think many people will think they'll look. I've owned the Rift DK1, DK2 and the retail CV1 - and VR is incredible - and for simple graphic titles the PS4 should be able to get it done, but something like this requires a ton of power to run at a good framerate. I'd be interested to see what they could do with the PS4 Pro on this title, I'd assume it will look better and run better - but the problem is that it's still Driveclub and that game stinks since the handling is garbage and the game is boring. But still in VR pretty much everything is amazing - so it has that going for it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	I really hope Driveclub VRs graphics aren't a real representation of as good as a racing game can get on PlayStation VR. Racing games were one of the things I was looking forward to the most, but one 5 minute run on the demo was enough for me for DCVR. Hopefully GT will be much better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	@thebadjesus I'm not bashing with the PS4 by saying this but the PS4 just doesn't have enough power to run what you think of as AAA titles. I've owned all the Oculus Rift's since the first DK1 - and on a PC with a Core i7 6-core processor and two 970s in SLI, Project Cars doesn't even look all that great and it doesn't even run well - and that's probably at least 7x the power of the PS4. Believe me in VR you always want performance over looks, if not you get motion sick very quickly. I'd take much more cartoon looks for better draw distance however, one of the great things about racing in VR is a sense of depth - if the sense of speed is correct you can judge how fast to take corners just like in a real car - meaning you can turn off all those racing lines even for tracks you don't know. It's very cool in person. Back to your point however while the GT group is amazing they're not miracle workers - the game might look good on the PS4 Pro, but the PS4 version will probably be in line with this - but regardless of looks we know it will play 5023212x better than Driveclub.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@bigrod69 @thebadjesus while driveclub vr might not be graphically great - thats a long way from saying ps4 cant do good looking vr - eve valkyrie is stunning though perhaps not a very challenging genre - but rigs... now that does looks great with mechs and arenas all with great lighting and shadows, textures and shaders and its probably the best vr game out there right now and its a full AAA game

i admit i've only tried the demo for driveclub vr and it was graphically disappointing but so far its the only game i've played on psvr thats been that way and even though it didn't look great - the cars handled well and i could judge cornering perfectly just like in a real car - something i've never mastered in a racing game before - so never know either with a bit more optimisation or the ps4 pro it could become a good game"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	I have both original version and VR version of this game. This VR version only reminds me how great of the original Driveclub is. So I drop the VR to play the original version, and never touch the VR version again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	@Takechiyo You should play more racing games, Driveclub (and I own it too) is a terrible racing game. Terrible physics, terrible driving model, just a very boring game to play. If you have a PC or XB1 pickup Forza Horizon 3, that is a great fun to play game. Driveclub however was a huge disappointment and didn't do much to hold me over until GT finally hits.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@bigrod69 @Takechiyo i disagree with you the original driveclub is actually a pretty good driving game - cars handle far better than in forza 5 (not got any of the others as it put me off them it was so bad - felt very little connection between my actions and those of the cars and graphically was very sub par compared to driveclub) and the vr driveclub the cars felt spot on for cornering - need to hook up the steering wheel and pedals and would be amazing but not buying it jsut yet and not faffing around with wheels for a demo

not sure how gt will compare in how they feel to drive but willing to bet it probably looks worse - vr or no vr!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@Isondead @bigrod69 @Takechiyo Saying something as brain dead as DriveClub handles better than Forza 5 is like saying your local 7-11 is a taller than the Empire State building. It's such a dumb illogical thing to say there is little reason to have any type of response. 

But anywho no, Driveclub is one of the worst handling games ever created, if you've ever driven a car you'd know how disconnected it is from reality. Meanwhile at the time it came out Forza 5 was the best handling console game ever created. I've had many many cars over the years, Corvette's, BMW, Cadillac's, a Camaro, a Mustang, a Monte Carlo SS, a 2005 Pontiac GTO, etc - I've had a ton of cars, Forza 5 was amazing as it actually for the first time in a game I felt the tires ""bite"" like they do in real life. Driveclub is completely disconnected from reality, it's basically a very boring arcade game - thus the reason it got such horrible reviews from everyone - including just normal people who have driven cars. It's an awful game with a nice coat of paint. I own a PS4, Gran Turismo is my favorite racing series ever, I'm not bashing Sony to bash Sony, but DC is an awful game, period."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@bigrod69 @Isondead @Takechiyo ah an american with american car history - no wonder you think forza 5 handles like real cars - your used to driving american car cars that cant go round corners to save themselves

that aside these are games not real world cars as such should be fun to play which forza 5 is not - and not only that its not realistic either

forza 5 a car doing 30mph can do a full on power slide that with the tiniest inputs turns into a uncontrolable donut - that is in no way representative of real cars -forza 5 cars had zero grip at any speeds

driveclub might not have been the technical simulation type of racing game - but in the corners the cars behaved roughly how you'd expect while driving - obviously the speeds in the game are higher and that taking a corner at 190mph in the real world is going to result in death most likely but thats where the whole 'game' thing comes in

and as for the vr version which i've got the demo of - the graphics suck but again the driving feels pretty good and you can time your breaking and cornering perfectly"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@Isondead @bigrod69 @Takechiyo Ah, some Eurotrash that thinks a BMW 4-series is an American made car.

Anywho, here's something for you - a Cadillac ATS handles better than any BMW I've ever driven, and car review websites will back that - not to mention my Corvette that could outhandle both of them.  BUT the reason I got the BMW and not another Caddy was because of the god awful Cadillac CUE system, which is their infotainment center disaster. The BMW's entertainment center based around their wheel nav setup works 100x better than the Caddy's touch screen disaster. But, in terms of just fun to drive and handling, the ATS was a notch above the BMWs I tested. The Corvette is a pure sports car and could obviously outperform both easily. Also so you know Corvettes have been some of the best handling cars in the world for a long time now.

Also for Forza 5 I have no idea what you're talking about. Did you play it with all the assists turned on or something? Actually if anything it sounds more like you were playing Forza Horizon, which is an arcade title. 

Anywho back to the point, Driveclub handling stinks and it's absolutely nothing like a real car - again that is the reason it got such god awful reviews. Go to a Gran Turismo forum and see what they have to say about Driveclub - it's the exact same thing I have to say. It's awful and the fact you think it's really good makes your opinion pretty insignificant. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@bigrod69 @Isondead @Takechiyo well i questioned if you really had a bmw after seeing the rest of the list

as for corvettes - there are a few of the most recent ones that have handled well - but ""the best handling cars in the world for a long time now"" is a huge exageration

as for forza 5 i put the disk in my xbox and it partially installed enough to let me start playing - did the few races it would let me - was awful - didn't mess with any settings and no it was not horizon - i never bothered finishing the install it was so bad - a total waste of money

the fact that hardcore forza/gt fans dont like driveclub is no real surprise its not a driving simulation - its a driving game and while the handling model isn't 100% accurate the changes are in the interest of fun allowing your to corner a bit faster than you would in real life but the feeling through the wheel always felt connected - forza 5 did not

anyway think will leave the argument there - you clearly dont like driveclub with a passion - i'm the same for forza 5"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	@Isondead @bigrod69 @Takechiyo Yes, I bought my last BMW on a lease - but I wasn't going to get it, I was going to get another Cadillac but their infotainment setup is horrendous. Also the 4-series had just came out, as in it was only the 2nd one the dealer had gotten and they're one of the biggest BMW dealers in the nation. The 3-series BMWs for the most part just didn't look right, I like the older ones better, the newest ones that I looked at and drove just looked trashy, very low class - but the 4-series was brilliant looking - it's a bit lower and wider than a 3-series and it had less stuff hanging off of it, it was just clean and classy. The ATS looked much better than the 3-series, but the 4-series looked better than the ATS - that along with the great infotainment system made me go that direction. Also as a side note they did not have any 435i's at the dealer, but I drove some 335i's with handling packages and some 328i's and the 428i with the M-sport package, and I must say that while the 35 series is certainly faster, the 28 series is so much more fun to drive as it's not so nose heavy. The Caddy ATS line was the same deal, with their V6 being able to throw you back in your seat my like 400hp GTO or my Vette could do, but going into corners it would nosedive - meanwhile the turbo 4 that Cadillac offers with their GM ride control setup they licence to Ferrari, well it was so much fun to drive, you could do anything in that car and it just stuck to the road. The 428i I ended up getting was similar, but not as nimble - but a tad bit faster than the ATS's I was looking at.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	disappointing, as racing sim/games could be the catalysts for myself and i presume many other track/racing enthusiasts to get on board with VR. i know of racing purists would solely a console to practice/train on racing games(cockpit, wheel ec).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"@darlok21 Racing games are fantastic in VR, but you need a ton of power to run them - the PS4 just doesn't have the horsepower. iRacing on the PC with VR is great, it runs great (if you have the specs), the driving model is great, you can drive like in a real car - as in you can ""feel"" the speed and judge how to take corners, etc, it's very impressive. Playing with a wheel and pedals it's great - you go over a hill and you actually get that light in your stomach feeling, it's amazing when it's done well AND it runs well and doesn't make you want to puke. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/driveclub-vr-review	"Shame the weather didn't make it but to be expected really with how much power VR needs. The main problem with DriveClub VR is the lack of AA and blurry image, more so than other VR games. Makes me think its running at a low native resolution.

If the PS4 Pro patch can boost the native resolution and add AA or bump up the res over 1080p and use super sampling, then it should look a lot better and improve the experience loads. The actual gameplay itself is still more than fine though and the price is fine, as I have the season pass on the standard game, so the discount is welcome."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/100ft-robot-golf-review	Dont worry. The makers of 100ft Golf will redeem themselves with their next title. Its called; Reboxing VR and Selling it on Ebay. Its a how-to game, and its projected to sell to everyone with VR. So 11. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/100ft-robot-golf-review	@myhomie88 Well the Vive, which is by far the most expensive VR, has sold 140,000. I'm 99.9999% sure you haven't even tried it. And so far the projected PSVR sales is 6 figures as well. Maybe stop being a douche and open your mind.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/100ft-robot-golf-review	"The idea seemed really cool and not being a ""true believer"" of VR, I truly hope that this game was going to be the shinning star of the early VR titles...reading this review I guess my hopes were dead wrong."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/20/100ft-robot-golf-review	Do you also have high hopes for one day meeting the real Mickey Mouse?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	in my career mode, I'm the number one contender for the NXT championship and every time an NXT takeover papper view happens the number two contender always gets the title shot and i face the number three contender
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	"I hate the reversal system. I preferred the more arcadey feel of the older games. 2011 I miss you. oh wait... My PS3 is still here :P

I Don't know. I think it was 2K16 my friend had and I was actually getting into the controls, but this one reminds me of 2K14. I just could not get that one going at all. Meh. I'll try to grind a bit more but I'm not hopeful at this point. Never been a fan of the 'realism' movement to begin with"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	wwe2k17 in career mode the CPUS get way too many reverses and blocks on special moves and the player doesn't get enough reverses. I was facing Samoa Joe and he blocked my spear attempt three times and I only got 5 chances the entire match to reverse and he got 25 reverses.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	"This game is terrible and I thought it would be better. To be honest, every game after WWE 2k14 are all trash. Keep your money and buy other games instead. It doesn't worth your money. Another thing that I want to point out is the only appealing thing about this game is all the legends that come with the game. Sadly, it's all locked, meaning there's no way for you to play them unless you do the stupid missions. The way you select your wrestler for the match is the worst part. You have to go through every wrestler in order to get to the one you want. The style that the creator of this game is going is fucking wack. If you think you guys are making the game better then the answer is ""NO."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	Worst Jogability ever!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	This game is not good infact it doesnt even come close to Smackdown 1 or 2 and here is why. The game is boring, linear and way too grindy than it should have to be the AI seems to know how to reverse everything even when there whole body is red and the story is just reused old trash from previous games. Unlike all the other sports games that WWE is trying to compete with it hasnt changed anything and is in fact missing features that people liked from previous titles. The same linear engine needs a good overhaul and the story needs a rework as fighting Zack ryder who is at contender rank and my guy at rank 6 me winning 6 matches in a row vs him and only him is way to off putting and boring for me and even after winning 6 matches I still was at rank 6, The whole NXT story is trash and doesnt work. The online features work well and the other features work well but in no way is this game classed as a good title infact its probably worth at 6.5/10 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	"I scrolled down a little and hear people state that it's either too easy or not fair in the way you can lose.
This game is good, it's no smackdown 1 or 2 on the ps1(an all time favorite wrestling game of mine) but they are getting close. There are a few things this game as failed. One being reversal, the timing is awful. There have been times I have reversed on que yet I get that annoying message that says I was too quick. Then there are times I'd go for a big boot, clothesline, etc., it's ignored by a grapple or Irish whip. The logic in that is frustrating.
Now we move into the glitches and thus game is full of them. I realize it's relatively new and i know they had testers but someone has to think they just don't care. Probably one of the most annoying glitches is the grapple glitch and there are a few. Imagine yourself doing a run out, you land your first hit then pick them up only to have them reverse the attack and they knock you flat on your ass. You miss your first chance to reverse their attack by the questionable reversing and now your sitting up and computer just continues to try to grab you but never ever does. You can't get for some unknown reason. You're just stuck watching some guy drain his stamina bar grabbing air and you're hopelessly sitting there. Your manager just stares in an eternal awe at an idiot who can't grab you and you with drool coming out the side of your mouth. Well, that's one grapple glitch, there's another where you're grabbed by your opponent and you stay in yet another forever glitch. Just ugh."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	Despite this review being a solid 8.2 I think the writer is comparing this game a little too much to the older versions. I myself have never played WWE games for the past decade but with the trial on Xbox One, I couldn't resist and I am now hooked! The writer states the career mode being poorly build compared to other versions. If you haven't played WWE games in a long time then the career mode is one of the best parts of the game. In comparison to UFC and other MMA games, WWE stands out by far to the competition. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	im rating that game 0.2 and dont get me wrong i played the wwe past games and i enjoyed it but this game is terrible you can beat your opponet how much you want and still lose
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	@beerus23 the game is easy as. to easy. I have to literally decide at the start of the match, just to make universe mode interesting, if im going to lose or not. Otherwise , Im 90% certain im going to win every single time on Legend difficulty., It should be programmed into the Ai, that they never do a move more than twice in succession, so they constantly at random, do different moves throughout the match or at least a complete random shuffle move system for the Ai. The ai is far to predictable and far to easy. I should never know what they are going to do next.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	@nyran125-tk you didnt read what i wrote but i will repeat on it you can beat up your opponent but when you pin him the count comes to 2 and then he kick out and thats pissing me off 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	@nyran125-tk and its not happend only once it happend so many times 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	"@beerus23 @nyran125-tk  I know your pain. Best way to do it, is to keep kicking the shit out of the opponent then build your finisher up, use it, rebuild it and finish on the signature finisher on pin fall. It took me a while to finally do it, 

I even had Triple H come up to me telling me to take it seriously, I wish I could press A to break out and give him a slap but it wouldn't let me. 2K games need to address that for WWE 2K18."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	"Wow.. How much did you make off this ""review""? I'll make it simple for everyone, the controls are decent, the AI is BS, the reversal system is questionable, the promo system is garbage, the face design is frightening (the eyes, OMG the EYES!). Good luck trying to win a match in career, got your finishing move ready to go? Well, the computer suddenly reverses everything you do and you can't stop it. Opponent have no life left? Will still kick out on 1. DON'T BUY THIS GAME OR IT'S HYPE!

Status: Game returned."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	@Echo3D luckily i can just download the game for PC
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	@eligzxkrek @Echo3D im not recommended i download it last night and about a hour ago i delete it 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	@Echo3D there must be some terrible players, ive never lost a single match in my career mode on LEGEND difficulty. Its to easy. I want it way more challenging than it is. I want to feel like I might lose a match if im not careful. But im 90% certain im going to win every match. So in universe mode, I have to think to myself...which wrestler do i want to win adn be that wrestler, because I know for a fact the Ai will lose. Its that easy. I have to make up my own silly rules, just to let the Ai win sometimes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/17/wwe-2k17-review	@nyran125-tk well im so desappoint on the body part in character creation and the fact that i cant make super heavywieght diva about the body part i was hopping that we will be able to adjust it insted of getting premade parts
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	 I've never played a Skylanders game, but when I played this at the preview event it was easily my most surprising experience.  It feels like playing a younger version of Darkspore, and I've pretty much decided I'll probably get it at some point (most likely Black Friday when it's cheaper).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	So you don't have to carry around a portal but you still have to carry around all the figures. Would make more sense if you could save them to your system like on 3ds.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	Sounds like the Switch version is the definitive edition.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	"Oh damn 6.8.

Well at least its got Zelda (thanks to the Wii-U)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	@ItsOnlyMirrors I think the 6.8 is a global review not just for the switch version
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	Easy to conshume?...:)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	"The creation crystal thing sounds pretty neat and being able to pay for it to be 3-d printed is cool. The microtransactions are bullshit though, but I can't really blame the devs when it's obviously making money.
I might pick it up a few months down the road."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	Zelda single handidly saved the Nintendo Switch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	@ARhollow Why do people keep saying this?? It's available for Wii U, and it performs the same on both. How is it going to save the Switch??
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	@Higg1134 True, but do you think the Switch would even sell with the abysmal launch titles minus Zelda?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	No one wants to spend £280 on a system to play sky landers and xbla games!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	2.5 million people say otherwise.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	It's expected for everyone to crap on Skylanders. I get it. If you've played the others at all, and liked them, this is easily one of the best. Everyone that I know in the skylander community things so. As a matter of fact, most of us view it as the best so far. It's a Great game if this is the type of game you like. Move on. Review dismissed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	Eh, not worth getting a Switch for. I'll wait for Super Mario Odyssey.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	No one would by a switch for this anyway since it's been out on other consoles for ages.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	@AJWesty Zelda?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	@kuczynt @AJWesty No good bundles with it at the moment unfortunately. Odyssey comes out around Xmas time so there should be some good deals around that time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	@kuczynt Not everyone is a Zelda fan. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/skylanders-imaginators-review	@P_RoD @kuczynt Now you are crazy. Everyone loves zelda. I mean everyone!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	this game is krazy fun!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	Why aren't you guys reviewing all the free content updates/maps ?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	So this game is the only really good VR game on PS4 yet?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@Richard.595 no, resident Evil 7 is the best game in PSVR. But Eve Valkrye is good, job simulator is good, Batman Arkham VR, Battlezone, PlayStation VR Worlds, Until Dawn: Rush of Blood (fantastic), Wayward Sky and Robinson The Journey are all great games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@Richard.595 ur a bit behind buddy... PSVR has a great catalogue of awesome games now.. eve was one of the first ones upon release of the PSVR
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@Runlikehell @Richard.595 I posted my comment in January and I am a bit behind? Heh
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	This game is worse then Destiny!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	This just reminds me that we need another Colony Wars game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@Jericho254 Man I loved that game...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	"I really dug the very brief demo, altho I suffer from motion sickness. I actually bought motion sickness pills for first time in my life just so I can enjoy VR games that would otherwise knock me out of commission (I'm looking at YOU Space Odyssey ;) ).
Anyway, I would love to have the full game but will definitely wait for a price drop."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	Worst 60 I've spent since NMS. This has a 20min campaign and Micro Transactions. Fuck this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	Cool game but $60 is way too high unless you plan on really digging into the MP. Wish I'd have waited for a sale.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	I tried the demo and it was very short =/ What I saw was neat, but I think I'd prefer to play it with a joystick.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@b4k42 you can, I set up a joystick and it works like a charm, much better than the controller
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@Ghoster462X @b4k42 I imagine though you're talking about the PC version and not the PS4 version...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@b4k42 @Ghoster462X you would be correct, though I thought I saw a combat stick for the PS4 not long ago
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@Ghoster462X @b4k42 What joystick did you get for the PC? I remember when there used to be so many cool peripherals for flight sims back in the day. What is a good one now?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	@Richard.595 I am using a T16000m , no need to get super fancy this works just fine. Solid construction and sensors in this unit are the same that are used in the top of the line sticks.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/14/eve-valkyrie-review	I love you, yea you!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	I'll stick with Dirt Rally. Brillint game for anyone who hasnt played it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	I like these games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"As i always say its good to have a hardcore sims but its also great to have games that are more accessible, you know pick up and play with a controller for every rally fan while still challenging yourself to get the best time on each stage.

Not sure what that part about lack of content comparing to other Rally games. I have Dirt Rally and its great but its also basic, no proper career mode and such"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@BrutalDoom I hear you on career mode and such; what I mean is that Dirt Rally has additional stuff, like the rallycross, and hillclimb. Also cars from all eras, like Group B, and '90s/early 2000s stuff. I get the feeling Kylotonn will continue to add content, but I've still got to weigh WRC 6 against its peers as it is for now. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	I would love to play this game on the Vita!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	so everything has to be Dark Souls or Forza
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"@foxhound20071980
Eff Forza."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"""sees the series get back on track""

If that's considered ""back on track"", I'm not sure I should browse IGN anymore."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"@Boge842 Yes, which on our scale means ""Good"". For mine, the WRC games haven't been good since Evolution's WRC: Rally Evolved. So yes, I do think it's back on track.

Not everything has to be a 1 or a 10, mate!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"@Luke_Reilly_AU @Boge842 Not knocking what you put here as i haven't played 6, agree with Rally Evolved too . It is amazing we don't even see games of the same calibre as PS2 Rally titles despite advances in hardware.

However you really need to look at what Dirt Rally offers as this is an incomplete retail release and doesn't deserve all the praise it keeps getting heaped on it. It is lacking locations and often what are there are very similar to each other as far as actual track layout aside from environmental effects.
it's obvious instead of making a proper full blown Rally game they were more interested in releasing a Dirt Rally 2 down the line so they can charge more instead.
This is not the decent Code Masters of old when they gave incredible value for money."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"@Luke_Reilly_AU Usually a 7/10 these days is an average game.  I don't consider an average game to be ""back on track"".  You're still missing some turns with a 7/10."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"@Boge842 @Luke_Reilly_AU Just to repeat, the 7 range here on IGN means good (again, with respect, it says GOOD alongside the score and short verdict).

http://au.ign.com/wikis/ign/Game_Reviews

I felt the previous Milestone games were mediocre to okay at best and I believe WRC 6 represents an improvement, thus it's back on track."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@Luke_Reilly_AU That just means that IGN and I no longer share the same opinion of our ratings.  So, just to repeat, I'm not sure I should browse IGN anymore.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	So ... any idea when this actually comes to consoles in North America?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	Dirt Rally > this pos
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@Descadent  Kind of agree, but to be fair Dirt Rally is a proper hardcore Rally sim, which for the average gamer may seem too hard. I have Dirt Rally myself, and it's a really challenging title, and being honest is so much better and easier with a race wheel setup.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@Descadent I love Dirty Rally! Althought I tend to call it Dark Souls Rally. LOL
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@oodoggz @Descadent  Agreed, it's not for the fainthearted Lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@oodoggz @Descadent It could barely be called a full game release though. It should have been a budget title. Just not enough content.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	"@Descadent Whats wrong with having a game that is made for rally fans in general. Does everything need to be a hardcore sim. i love Dirt Rally but im picking this up as well. Nice career mode, just pick up and play with a controller and have fun, and it can still provide challenge.

I still think Richard Burns Rally is much better than Dirt Rally. 

Its also funny that Sebastian Loeb Rally has better tarmac physics than Dirt while i have to say non tarmac stages are flat which reminds me of Colin McRae 2 which i play to this day every now and then. Plus it has a lot of content.

Speaking of classics, started playing WRC Evolved again as well."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	Forza should include rally racing in their motorsport series. They already took over indie racing, so why not take over rally as well?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@ShakeItLikeIDo3 They did, is called Horizon 3. Rally races in that game are amazing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@DeadRocky9 @ShakeItLikeIDo3  Not quite the same, but I get what you mean.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@Booyah74 @DeadRocky9 @ShakeItLikeIDo3 Yeah I got what he/she meant, an official Forza rally game.(that would be cool) But until then Horizon 3 is the closest thing we got.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@DeadRocky9 @ShakeItLikeIDo3 lol that is not Rally racing. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@ShakeItLikeIDo3 FORZA HORIZON 3 SAYS HELLO!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	@ShakeItLikeIDo3 One game engine can do so much. Rally needs to be separate as a game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/wrc-6-review	Psh, if you're looking for a good alternative, there's always Diddy Kong Racing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	"Not really sure what Dan was expecting out of this one.  The name of the game pretty much sums up what you're going to get.  As I played this demo as well, I had about 45 minutes with it.  The robotic companion in puzzle games ""theme"" is certainly growing old.  However, the games' premise is straightforward and simple.  There's not a lot of gimmicks here.  The most frustrating part of the game for me was the fact that my controller kept going out of bounds and I would get the dreaded ""red controller,"" signaling I was outside of the game's play area...which seems to be undefinable.....even moving the tower up and down to various positions didn't always help.  The best portions of the game for me was when I could place a block down slowly and with precision....then I actually felt like I was building something, instead of plopping down blocks hoping they wouldn't fall over.  I also looked around and found a Hidden Block that wouldn't have otherwise been given to me, had I not taken advantage of the 360-degree functionality.  The demo I would have given about a 6.5 to a 7.  It's not quite as bad as the review score lets on."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	I guess if it was named Call of Duty: Tumble or Battlefield Tumble, IGN would give it a 9.5
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	"5.8  How? Are we playing the same game?

Lets see here, a full game experience for 9.99 that offers creative and challenging puzzles, a bit of humor, and fully utilizes all of the motion capabilities of the PS VR? Oh yah, I can totally see how this got a 5.8.

Seriously though, this was the first game I bought and I absolutely love. ""Just stacking blocks"" is a hell of a lot of fun when you have to figure out the physics of the game as well keep the pieces under a limbo bar or fit every oddly shaped piece onto a platform."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	"Jesus. PSVR sure smells like yet-another Sony peripheral flop.
All it is is a disguised return of motion controls."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	Supermassive, make UNTIL DAWN 2 instead of VR minigames!!!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	Well at least they got superhypercube. Now that Phil FIsh is back in the game, let's hope for some Fez VR. That would seriously make me consider getting vr sooner than later.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	The Portal and Trine games are the only puzzle games I've actually ever managed to sit all the way through.  IMO most of them get tiresome long before they finish.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/tumble-vr-review	I literally just received my PSVR (but i'm at work so I'll have to wait to hook it up). Having said that, I have a son who has blocks...when I stack them it's pretty immersive so I'll stick to that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Rez in VR is always a blast. It is immersive and fun,after playing the more serious VR games e.g. Here the lie, Rez is a refreshing break.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Do Portal next ?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Is this a release or is it built from the ground up for ps4
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@ratznest Remake with VR support.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	As well as MeR
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	"First game I bought. Can't wait to play tonight! I got my VR set up (about 45 minutes), tried a couple demos, and the Rez demo brought me right back to 2001 with my Dreamcast when we used to play Rez on a projector in college. Those tunes man, that's a timeless soundtrack. I was sold on the demo (before that, lol, I'll buy Rez every time it releases), but so glad to see Vince was reviewing as this is totally a game he'd like :) Nice writeup, Vince! 
KINDA!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Give an update would ya ?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Loved this game on PS2 but no interest is playing a game this old in VR.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@loser667 The PSVR demo disc has a demo of Rez on it. Before deciding to skip a game for age, perhaps play the demo. The reviews are great and the art style feels more timeless than dated, at least to me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@DorffMeister @loser667 Thanks for the headsup.  I got Thumper and love it, but was hesitant to get Rez because I already beat it several times on PS2.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Rez up those fryers, 'cause I am sure hungry for one-
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	IGN is reviewing VR games much lower than other places.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@captainexplosion69 Maybe IGN is reviewing VR games more realistically than other places...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@captainexplosion69 Just be glad the people reviewing arent prone to motion sickness. When they are, thats when the reviews really hit rockbottom and those same reviewers dont seem to take into consideration that they may be part of the minority experiencing it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	"I love Rez. If I ever do get a PS VR, which I very well may do sometime in the near future, this will undoubtedly be one of the first games I play. This and Thumper...and RIGS.
:)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@ModSev same here.  i'll be getting both as well.  screw the vr though.  as soon as  i get a ps4 (when the neo comes out) : D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@ModSev Thumper is so good.  If you love Rez, you WILL love Thumper.  And actually, you don't need VR to play Thumper, although imo it's 100x better playing it in VR mode.  Total trance.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Am I the only person that thinks this game looks hectic and terrible? I never played it, but I won't be buying until I can play it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	It's an on-rails rhythm shooter, pretty easy to get the hang of. To me it was rarely hectic, but I got really into it at one point. I guess I can see how it would be hectic for some people. Check out videos on YouTube or something, it's a relatively old game now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@LoyolaProp1 It's highly stimulating, but neither hectic nor terrible. Get out of the comfort zone once in a while.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Couldn't be anymore disappointing........Coming out with new hardware, and NICHE games is all SONY has to offer?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	@Always_Right Yeah, it's pretty disheartening. I want to snag a psvr but it's not looking good. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	"@Always_Right see.. to me it was disheartening when the next-gen ""arrived"" and all we got were one-size-fits-most games.  need a healthy mix."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	Have you seen the amount of indies the PS4 has?? I can't stand when people say there is not enough variety of games, there is! You just have to look a little harder
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	"Sorry. I shouldve been more specific. First, I know all about the indies. Indies are prevalent on every platform (have much love for indies). 2nd I was referring to the next-gen arrival. Those first 2 years. 3rd, I was more specifically thinking physical niche releases. The ones that are in-between that AAA and indie line. AA's if you will. 

The type that were oh so prevalent in the PS1, PS2, PSP and to a lesser extent, the 360/PS3 days. And now found on the Vita/3DS (funny enough the Vita is now missing the AAAs.)

It wasnt a shot at the PS4. More at the early goings of the next gen transition. Only now are the physical niche games starting to roll out. On the PS4 that is. Sadly, very little is on the horizon for the X1 in this regard. Pretty much why I held off and stayed with PC and the Wii U. Those indies are everywhere. Those AAs. Not so much. The fairly recent and upcoming roll out is pretty much the reason that I'll be picking up a PS4 here soon with no interest in the X1. Just waiting on the Neo since I held out this long anyway."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	"@Always_Right We have two games 9.0 or higher, this one is over 8.0 and we have two other games over 7.0.

Five quality games, with two of them being great, is a solid launch.

I honestly have no idea what people were expecting."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/rez-infinite-review	"@FanboyPsychologist @Always_Right
It's just a bunch of kids who can't afford the hardware, trying to rip down a fun system and fun games to make themselves feel better. Every launch of new hardware is like this. Happened back in the day in school during the SNES/Gen and N64/PS1 launches, and happens today. Except now all those kids who used to just complain on the bus, now have internet access and act like know it alls in a public forum. Having a career that allows you to buy every system really negates any reason to get all defensive like they get. Let them be."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	Yeah, the story line is confusing, maybe its not supposed to make sense.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	Just beat it. I enjoyed it but man was it confusing as hell
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	I played the demo, but not full game yet.  I understand some players experience nausea from VR, but reviewing the game based on a personal nausea experience seems not needed.  Stick to the game details itself.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	I loved the visuals, more in particualr the surreal elements that work so well in VR, But I pretty much felt lost throughout the whole experience, the narrative didn't gel with what was taking place. There is a multiple ending element to the game also, but you will have to replay it from the start to see it, not that I have, because I dont think I have the patience for another 4 hours of slight disappointment. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	I could not enjoy it unfortinitly. So far this was the only vr game to make me sick. Never had any issue with motion sickness until i tried this demo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	"I'd give it a 6/10

It's not THAT bad although I also had to take breaks. VR Sickness is person dependent though, it's not ALWAYS on the developer. I've had people try this game and NOT get sick. What VR games make you sick is different for everyone. 

That being said the graphics are kind of nasty. It's like someone smeared Vaseline on Sin City. 

Dual Stick controls in VR is poison. They should have made it so you can stand/swivel chair and use your head exclusively as the camera. 

At the same time though, VR sickness is something you can build a tolerance to. After level 3 I stopped getting nauseous. It only happens because your brain thinks you're moving even though your body tells it it's not so what you get is internal confusion. Some developers use comfort controls (teleportation) to fight this but that doesn't work in stealth based first person horror adventure games. 

Also, just because you weren't intuitive enough to understand the deep meaning behind the symbolism doesn't mean the developer doesn't understand their own story. A post they made on the PlayStation Bog actually talks 13 different horror inspirations behind they different aspects of the game and specifically call out what influenced what. Just because YOU didn't get it doesn't mean it's not there to get. I got it just fine. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	It makes me wonder what RE7 will be like in VR. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	Pretty darned good, Imo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	"The game graphics do leave more to be desired but the experience is good once you get into it. The thing with VR is that its not like any other game play experience you can get from a TV or monitor. Being fully immersed in a game is night and day compared to looking at it on the TV so its weird to hear all these folks trying to compare the ""graphics"" when they should be comparing the ""experience"". Drive Club VR..yes the scenery graphics takes a hit but the experience of being in the car far outweighs the shitty graphics...and shitty graphics can be fixed. Like it or not VR is the future of game play. Sure its a bit hit and miss at the moment but as some have said here, Version N+1 or 2 will make playing on a screen totally redundant. 

As for the PS4 pro, anyone who thinks this wasn't brought out to improve VR is crazy. Sony can t come out and say as much as it would risk alienating existing ps4 owners but what they are essentially saying to developers is..""here is your path to take your games and VR experiences to the next level""...I'd be dumbfounded if all game developers aren't writing patches right now to take advantage of this.

My two cents of course...;-)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	I couldn't agree more
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	I played the demo. I actually fell off my chair. This game is freaky. I don't get scared by scary movies but scary VR is a whole different level.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	"Get anything besides this crap.

1. The grahics are shit, the trailer is really a horrid lie. Trust me, after playing you'll ask if you're playing a crummy upscaled 3DS game. The graphic in this aren't worthy to be on a PS3, let alone the PS4, the fact that it's VR is no excuse, and in fact the horrible graphics no doubt add to the motion sickness.

2. Horrible camera controls. Two options: You ""look"" in a direction and it slowly, (I mean SLOWLY) turns you to face that way, in this mode pushing the ""look"" stick on the controller fades to black, and forcibly turns you, it's like a teleport effect. You can also turn the head steering off and look faster with the right stick, BUT when doing this the screen constricts as you move.

I honestly don't understand why? Why implement shite like that? I've played a ton of the VR games, what's wrong with 1 - 1 head tracking, or using the stick alone to move??? Nearly every game in Worlds did this, and I didn't get sick at all. (I also have a pretty decent tolerance, I can read in the car, never got sick on a boat, etc. Yet this is the ONLY game I've felt so sick on. Not even Until Dawn on the rollercoaster of doom did I feel nauseous."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/12/here-they-lie-review	@stolenunder I only played the demo but yeah... this game was noticeably a step down from the other games I've played
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	Yeah but the force awakens sucked
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	I liked everything except fortifying your surroundings... that happened FAR too frequently. If you have the X1 S, the 4k enhancements make the game gorgeous... or downright disgusting, depending on where you are.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	Meh, I had to force my way through the campaign on this one.  I just wasn't feeling it.  The new characters didn't do it for me and they're constant banter got old.  At least Marcus was in it.  And the rinse-and-repeat game-play just doesn't work for me anymore.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	Its weird that Xbox franchise games seem to automatically get a little extra score from IGN. I have not played this game but I guarantee you that it is not better than Uncharted 4 because I have played the other GOW and it isnt even close.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	@bengalhoel I have played both games and all i can say is that you can't compare these two. Gears of War 4 was so much fun i didn't want to stop playing but Uncharted 4 had me bored sometimes. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	Gears of war 2 was the best, it's been going downhill since.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	Can you play Horde mode on split screen co-op?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	@dagomo yes
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	I loved Playing this franchise. Still do, but I must say this one is just a money maker for developer. It is still fun killing stuff, but it is not Gears of War I remembered. I was full of emotions with Dominics story, and Marcus and his problems with father. It is fun to see old Marcus again, but I really feel there's missing something ( better story maybe ).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	@Larpee Truthfully it is on par with the first game. Gears really picked up for me in 2 and 3 as everything started coming together.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	Amazing game so far,better than the others,graphic blow them out the water.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	It felt like the game just came to a screeching halt. I was honestly shocked when the credits rolled. Its a really good well made polished edition to the franchise. Some minor annoyances include the NPCs knocking my out of cover and also my target position randomly changing when i go in and out of cover. I never had these issues in the previous games. Minor annoyances but it is was still a heck of a lot of fun while it lasted. I am glad I only paid 25.00 for it though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	@orcflesh2075 I paid $35 and 100% agree.  Beat it yesterday and for me I was pretty disappointed.  I might be done with the franchise.  I pretty much see exactly where the story line is going..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	@1track @orcflesh2075 I am a day 1 gears of war fan since day one I agree the storyline was horrible but the mechanics and the online are amazing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/11/gears-of-war-4-review	@Cortesbeast @1track @orcflesh2075 The story was a little weak.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	Does this one have those insufferable assholes form the last game in it, you know those worthless characters Lara felt obligated to save instead of leaving them to their rightful gruesome fate?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	It was too short and ends abruptly with a not so difficult big Baddie.  Now, leading up to the final battle is a real horror show.  There are back to back to back to back to back to back... you get the idea - battles that obviously take health and ammo to get through, and no place in between to replenish.  It's too fast paced too much to do, so you really can't enjoy it or engage, you just run jump and shoot for an hour straight trying to stay alive.  The graphics aren't what you'd expect for 2016, either.  Oh, and it is locked down with software regulated crawling and crouching, so you can't sneak up on anyone as you want, it does it for you or leaves you standing in the open and gives you no choice.  Over all it's not that great.  Too linear, bad story line, too short, limited controls, lacking graphics.  I'd give it a four out of ten.  Far Cry 4 was better than this, if that helps you any.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	"not really a great game....and def not a 9.3....

1. Cheesy story with poor pacing and anticlimactic revelation.
2. Terrible and shallow villain.
3. Poor voice acting.
4. Terrible fighting mechanics and difficulty level. Stupid AI that can easily be killed in 2 hits without taking any significant damage.
5. Final boss ridiculously stupid and easy.
6. Poor attempts at emotional depth that don't really register or stick.

The tombs and weapon upgrading were somewhat fun and kept me entertained for a bit.

Game is like a 6.5 - 7. Starting to really believe IGN sold out to these big corporations because they give every crappy game a 9 or a 10 now."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@Davezig @mikmiro Yeah, they should because he nailed it.  And he was being nice.  I'd give it a four.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@mikmiro Shooting is horrible
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	"Just finished it. Amazing game. As good as the 2013 'Tomb Raider' game. Not something I say lightly as that game was easily one of the best games I've played in the last 5 or so years. 

Baba Yaga and Blood Ties were both pretty good also. Tried to give Cold Darkness Awakened a go, but truth be told it didn't hold my interest after about 10 minutes."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@SidewaysBigM I absolutely loved it as well. I can't believe some people disliked it so much. To each his own, I suppose.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	Right guys, I don't trust sign reviews so whats the real deal with this game, is it worth buying?  I love the old tomb raiders in their day, thought the last reboot was just meh, so unsure whether to get this.  Is this more combat oriented like the reboot or more traditional trying to solve puzzles in tombs? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@GlesgaBoy87 There are a lot more tombs which are all larger than the first game and it is more open worldy and RPG like but underneath it all (combat, crafting, collectibles) it is quite similar to the first reboot. I would say if you didn't like that one this one won't change your mind even though I personally loved it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@GlesgaBoy87 I loved it. If you didn't like the reboot, you wont like this. It builds upon the foundation of the reboot.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@chopstickwhoyoudo @pinkincide3  completely agree with pinkincide3, I loved the first game so much I played through it three times, bought Rise, couldn't even finish it, bored me so much and level design was nowhere near as good
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@Jontonius1995 @chopstickwhoyoudo @pinkincide3 oh man give it another try.  The first game is a masterpiece but this really is a strong follow up.  once time catches up in the story and there are no more flash fowards, the game opens up to some really amazing stuff.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@pinkincide3 I liked 2 a bit more because there were more tombs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-20-year-celebration-review	@pinkincide3 I'd say the first had a more imaginative story, better npc characters with better voice acting, and yes better level design. However, while on my first playthrough of Rise I wasn't all that impressed - except with the new tombs and puzzles - on second play I got completely obsessed with it and ended up with 100% completion and most of the other trophies. And I loved the Blood Ties dlc: added a lot of depth and background to Lara's character. So overall I'd probably rate Rise (ps4) a fraction above the first one. Also Lara has a lot more facial expression in Rise - 2013 Lara seemed be in permanent botox-freeze.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	I am just starting this game as it was in my back log and I am really impressed so far. Story and voice acting are superb. The city looks fantastic and the soundtrack might be the best in any game. Graphics look great on PS4 Pro and a 4K tv too. Gameplay is definitely not the star of the show but it is more than serviceable as a vehicle for delivering an amazing story. Having a great time so far.

I've had it since day one and through multiple playthroughs only encountered two glitches, neither game breaking."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	@TheRisingSon  I played on day 1 and I had a few. I was supposed to steal a boat and when I got there it wasn't there. Nothing game breaking. I stopped playing because it was repetitive but just started playing again and I'm liking it. What did you think of Andromeda?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	To sum up this game: Just at the beginning I was shooting at the police in a crowded place and in a blink of an eye everyone disappeared. Glitches like this are scattered all over the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	So I'm super late to the party but I got around to playing the game late and it took a while to finish. And man, what a fun ride it was. The best story from a game in a long long time coupled with some great action set pieces made for a memorable experience which more than makes up for the sometime boring and repetitive game play. Just stick with the story missions and ignore the peripheral stuff like raising takes for rackets and this is an unforgettable experience! Also the voice acting is just phenomenal! Lincoln, Donovan and father james deserve Oscars for how well they are portrayed and I'm super psyched by the extended interaction with the irrepressible Donovan hinted in the post credit cut scene. All in all an easy 9 for me with perhaps the best story experience since the last of us.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	Haha funny. I finished the game today.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	@BeknIghted  I started playing again. I bought on day 1, played for awhile and quit. Now I'm back at it and I'm really liking it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	I'm sure glad I didn't pay too much attention to this review.  I am LOVING this game.  I am also a little under thirty percent finished, although I have been playing for HOURS AND HOURS.  Perhaps my perspective as a normal player is different compared to these whiz-kid reviewers  who go zooming through games to make their media deadlines.  Yes, the missions may seem repetitive, but they play so wonderfully -- a little stealth, a lot of blasting, with ammo and weapons always readily available -- that I wish the game would never end...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	IGN has been dropping the ball on their reviews. I no longer trust them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	who encounters with graphic issue is probably playing the game on ps4. If you play it on PC with 144hz you'll see it's almost better than gta v . So don't complain because of your system . Game's graphics are spectacular
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	"Mafia 3 on PS4 is a good game. Apart from the graphics.
Visually the game is very last gen, about the same level as Saints Row 3. Draw distance is very short, and far away detail is obscured by fogging. Yes, fogging, the kinda fogging we used to see in N64 games... Also, the quality of light and shadows is very poor.
The game is also very buggy, even with the 3.6GB update. The hero and his allies constantly get stuck to the environment, requiring restart of missions.
This is all a great shame, because apart from those ugly looks and bugs, the game is very good fun. Good gameplay, solid missions, and the big world is fun to explore. And its also fun to just walk around and listen to the npc chatter, which is very well written and acted.
As it is now, I give the game 6. If they update the looks and iron out the remaining bugs, then I will give it 8."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	"Im so glad that I rented this game from RedBox. Because had I not, I would have be extremely upset at myself for wasting money.
I really enjoyed the story however the gameplay just seemed a bit repetitive and clunking. I felt like all the guns shot the same or not too far. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/10/mafia-3-review	I've enjoyed the game other than the ridiculous number of crashes I've experienced. It's really sad that they've been unable or unwilling to fix it. I haven't experienced crashes this frequent with any other game this gen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	so i got this game for free on ps store without psn+ and i am enjoying it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	http://jp.ign.com/thetomorrowchildren/7088/review/  japan ign give it a 7.3. japan kinda loves the game while western folks hates it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Another mediocre game for ps4, shit, when will the big guns arrive, this is definitely the worst generation for Sony.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Imortu.San Greatness awaits. :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Imortu.San dont you have your own opinion???
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"@Imortu.San @Imortu.San  I know this is an old comment but damn man you need to either get educated or troll better.

So let's break that down, anything over an 80 score on Metacritic is considered ""great"" or like the sarcastic responder, ""greatness awaits.""  So how much greatness awaits a PS4 owner (one of the 50 million plus which breaks even the Wii's record)?  Well you have to go through 176 games before you reach a score of 79 on Metacritic.  

If you can play through 176 games completely during a console generation then more power to you but that's by far not worst generation.  Not to mention that the PS3 didn't get it's good games (Last of Us, GoW 3, Uncharted 2 and 3, and more) until 4 or more years into it's life, PS4 is only 3 years old.

Hmm how many games on the Xbox One are 80 and above?  109 :/  I would count the PC (only has 15) but it's not a fair comparison because not as many PC games get reviewed.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Wow IGN, took you a whole friggin month to review a game and tell us it's not worth our money. Serially? Every other site had thier reviews up already.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Lol these comments disappoint me. If its not call of duty its not good. Get some better taste in games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Dethera Thats just the majority of idiots who jumped on the gaming bandwagon and only play 3 games, COD, Fifa and GTA.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Idk why I’m so interested in this game. Thank goodness its free
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"It's made by Q-Games, so I expect it to be pretty good. Honestly, the weird aesthetic alone would probably keep it interesting.
Unfortunately, though, I do not own a PS4."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@orzFingers It does look rather cool , nothing else like it. I like that aspect.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	I was pretty excited for this game so I signed for the beta as soon as it was possible. Then I played it and found it boring as hell. Yes, it has a cool aesthetic but it's a job simulator.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Who knew a marxism simulator would be boring?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"New Sony made IP - check

Another mediocre exclusive - check
Nothing new here..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Sladey1601 Enjoy your 3 games a year on xbox dude.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	So much irony when Sony release 1 or 2 games a year each spring then nothing till next spring, even Sony themselves admit their releases are 'Sparce'
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Sladey1601 its weird because almost every year they produce the goty and most xbox games of the year are multiplatforms. Check it out for the past 5 years youll be surprised. Just look at ps4 sales most people understood youre just a little slower than the rest of us.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@olivier1806 @Sladey1601 This dude is too slow to realize Dragon Quest Builders just released at the same time as this and got an 8.9. XB1 gamers can't comprehend having options within one genre.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	More releases then the Xbone son
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Yea because that was made by Sony wasn't it. Shows Sony give nothing when everyone got to throw 3rd party games into the mix other than talk about first party games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	3rd party releases? Yea lots of them because Sony make 90% crap as this article once again shows. At least Nintendo and Xbox first party titles are worth playing
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@rizzchit @Sladey1601 That's why i download the ones they give you each month with xbox live Gold :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Sparse
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Sladey1601  I was going to say are you bored already from playing Gears of War 4 but.... that's not even an Xbox1 exclusive anymore.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	I've got Forza Horizon and Gears to keep me happy, unlike Sony games Xbox One games have lasting power and not ready for trading in 10 hours later but I bet your bored waiting till Feb at least for a Sony to release something worth buying. Speaking of non exclusives, I don't see any Xbox games on anything but MS devices, both run on Windows 10 and share the exact same eco system to the point you only need 1 purchase, which by that logic when the Pro comes out there will be no exclusives on PS4 either as 2 consoles play the same games, one better than the other, just like PC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"@Sladey1601  So happy that you have to go to a ps4 exclusive game review and post your nonsense comment in order to justify your purchase, which probably came out of your parents wallet anyway.

P.s that game you traded in 10 hours later sounds a lot like Quantum Break."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Justify my purchase? I own all 3 consoles, just the PS4 side is lacking in actual first party titles worth buying. I haven't bought anything on my PS4 since Uncharted 4, and for the next 6 months theres still nothing to buy other than multiplats like FFXV (probably get the PS4 version) and BF1 (which any multiplayer game is an instant xbox purchase)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Ter3340 @Sladey1601 It is for me currently until they fix the windows store where i am :) . Can't download the PC version at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Aaaaaaand another similar game released at the same time with a Super High score (Dragon Quest Builders) ... check. That's what it is to be a PS4 gamer. Options.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Options? One shite game and 1 3rd party minecraft clone? If you want options you have both Gears and Forza Horizon 3 just released which are both excellent and worth everyone's money. Quite a difference in releases
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"@Sladey1601 Ah, so now is the time of year XB1 gets is 3 releases per year. Meanwhile PS4 has been rolling in exclusives all year long. And now you can add a good 20 VR games to the list. Wow, XB1 is so shitty, LMAO!

Uncharted 4, Ratchet and Clank, MLB The Show 16, Street Fighter 5, Paragon, The Last Guardian, BlazBlue: Central Fiction, Alienation, Shadow of the Beast, Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir, Salt & Sanctuary, Gravity Rush Remastered, Valkyria Chronicles, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth, DOA Xtreme 3, Stories: The Path of Destinies, Amplitude, Dead Star, Headlander, Kill Strain, Star Ocean: Integrity and Faithfulness, Darkest Dungeon, The Tomorrow Children, Dragon Quest Builders, No Man’s Sky, World of Final Fantasy, King of Fighters XIV, I am Setsuna, Abzu, Bound"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Isn't it funny when Xbox Exclusives are only ones from Microsoft, but PS4 exclusives are from any tom, dick, or harry and passed off as Sony exclusives. Most of that list is either released and scored less than 7 or are multiplats. How about you take out the ones NOT made by Sony and see the true reflection of that list. Then compare them to what Microsoft have released and realise Sony has given us pretty much feck all this year, just like last year. And there might be a good 20+ VR games too just a shame they are all absolutely dog shit and to play them you need a PS3 quality VR headset that costs the price of 2 PS4 consoles.... I'll pass on that
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"@Sladey1601 LMAO, it's hilarious watching XBox fans doing mental gymnastics trying to come up with reasons great games they can't play on XB1 aren't really great. It's because they're third-party now? LOL!

But let's go ahead and take a look at the games from Sony, since that's what you want: Uncharted 4, Ratchet and Clank, MLB The Show 16, The Last Guardian, Alienation, Shadow of the Beast, Gravity Rush Remastered, Kill Strain, The Tomorrow Children.

That's 10 games. Only one of them scored less than 7/10 on IGN. You're just pitiful, lol. You have no argument to make.

Add to that, Street Fighter 5, Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir, Salt & Sanctuary, Valkyria Chronicles, Headlander, Darkest Dungeon, Dragon Quest Builders, Abzu, Bound, Dead Star, Amplitude, I am Setsuna all scored higher than 7, and many of them over 8 or 9.

Come to think of it ... really only like 2 or 3 out of 30 games scored less than a 7! LOLOLOL! You lose so bad it's crazy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"Strange because when I look on meta it says a completely different story...
http://www.metacritic.com/company/scea
Then you look at both Nintendo and Xbox.... (note Xbox has released 11 games between now and this time last year, and only 2 scored less than 80). Sonys last decent game was in May, Uncharted 4

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Sladey1601 OK, if Microsoft has XBox has released 11 games, name them. Name every one. This is going to be funny, lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"Gears of War 4
Forza Horizon 3
Recore
We Happy Few
Ori and the Blind Forest Definitive Ed
Quantum Break
Killer Instinct Season 3
Rise of the Tomb Raider
Forza 6

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"@Sladey1601 This shit is golden!

Is We Happy Few even out on XBox? Anyway, it's neither published nor made by Microsoft. It's a third-party game. Wow, dude. Wow.

Gears of War 4 isn't out yet.
Rise of the Tomb Raider isn't exclusive, and it's not made by Microsoft, even with the B.S. ""published by MS on MS platforms"" crap.
Forza 6 was released over a year ago.
Killer Instinct Season 3 is DLC, not a game.
Ori was released Last MARCH! LOLOLOLOLOLOL!!!!!!
ReCore is third-party. You can't claim it's first-party when Armature just made a PS4 game ... that's better! LOL!

In the last year, MS has released Forza Horizon 3 and Quantum Break. That's it. Wait, that's not true. They also released COBALT.  What's the score for that? LMAOOOOOOO!!!!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Game, set, match
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Ha
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	"We happy few has been out for a while, and if it's 3rd party how come it's not on PS4 or any other console?
Gears of War 4 is out and is a excellent game.
Funny how Tomb Raider isn't exclusive and you mock the published by MS, but you list about 10 games that I could have said exactly the same to you about. Good for one but not the other...
Forza 6 was less than a year old and I was listing games out within a year so it's perfectly valid
KI Season 3 is a game and DLC. I can play just Season 3 without owning Season 1 or 2 so it's a game in itself than dlc
Ori was released last march, but the definitive (remastered and a lot more added) came out a few months ago and had its own review.
Recore is an Xbox Game, and if we're to believe it's a 3rd party game because you can also buy it on PC (from the windows xbox store only) then pretty much all of your previous list is null and void because that's how Sony gets their exclusives like SFV, etc.
Lastly, if you want to base your scores of IGN and not meta (funny how you don't use meta, because the majority of the score your claiming to be good exclusives absolutely suck) then Xbox once again trumps the PS4 line up"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	Lol dude you are lookin like a fool. Just give it up don't dig the hole any deeper
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/the-tomorrow-children-review	@Sladey1601 Dude if you are happy with your Xbox , Good for you. Are you sad that most of the 360 population switched over to ps4 ? Deal with it. No good sony exclusives? Meh, opinions differ. Not much options on ps4? Tell that to my gamelist of 400+ strong ^^. If you can actually enjoy your games rather then your console of preference you might lead a happier life ;)

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	 Great game for anyone's collection. This is the perfect go to if you are burned out on another game. Very easy and relaxing. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	Prettier, but smaller than Minecraft.  If you've played Minecraft before, you may feel claustrophobic.  Listening to the same soundtrack over and over won't help either.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	This game is amazing. They got my 100€ as I bought both versions. Kicks Minecraft big time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	If I never find minecraft interesting.  Should I still give this a try? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	Not a fan of minecraft at all. Purchased this after high praise and I'm hooked. The game really opens up after the beginning quest but it's a very good game imo.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	"Great review. Great voiceover.
It was interesting to have an adult review a game (not a manchild). Considering a lot of gamers have kids, it's great to have reviews for games like these consider that aspect."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/07/dragon-quest-builders-review	@RobSmithUTB @Apfelschteiner Let me echo that sentiment Rob, this was a very well-written review. :)

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	Dont agree with this review. I just played this today and though i was skeptical of the vr, it blew my mind. No challenge or thrill? Did the reviewer play more than the first stage, or piss ass easy? I played normal and though didnt find it too hard, had a blast! I did beat it in one sitting, but with the fun factor and the price, my friend made me a believer. Ill be picking up the vr and this game payday.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	"I can't agree with this review.  Hands down one of the best games I have played.  I give major props to the length of the game, I can't imagine how difficult it was to put all this together.  The game had me scared over and over.  I thought the game play was fantastic.  Same with sound, story line, the works.  

The one thing I did learn from this review was not to take the reviewers seriously.  I mean she wasn't even close.  God bless."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	I think this game is awesome so far. I don't normally like horror games, but it came with my PSVR so I figured I'd try it. I don't startle easily, but it has made me jump a little bit a couple times. I had to stop playing because it freaks me out too much lol. I think this game demonstrates what PSVR games are capable of very well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	I think this review is a bit harsh, this is the most fun I've had on a 'light gun' style game in a long time, it seems like most people on Metacritic (Users and critics) gave this an overall positive rating as well. I must admit I haven't played the original 'Until dawn' so I can't really critique any narrational aspect in this franchise, but as a VR experience I found it really intense and for a tenner I really can't grumble. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	Fake review. Just like we have fake news spreading like syphilis on a college campus, we now have the disease of fake reviews.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	fuck you for not letting me watch your video. dumbasses.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	"I know I'm late to the party, and reviews are just someone's opinion, but did she even play the game before reviewing it?  

I have RE7, Battlezone, Star Wars VR, and Batman....this is easily one of my favorites. 

This game is a great way to show what VR can do.  It's not supposed to be a AAA game, it's an arcade rail shooter.  That's it.  And it excels at that.  

What's wrong with the bosses?  Seems they are right to me.  

I guess I could agree with your score if this had been a full price $60 game, but at $20, what are you looking for?  Easily worth at least $30+.  

I'd say 8/10, only thing keeping it from a 9 or 10 is there should be a little more variety with the different paths.  Maybe a smaller boss if you take the wrong way.  

How let's get House of the Dead VR going.  :)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	I played the demo, THE DEMO, twice and got scared both times playing it. Now I'm hyped for the full game and I always thought IGN was a terrible review company, but now I'm sure of it like when they rated RE7 a 7.7. I don't know if they were trying to be clever, but they're giving great games bad names when they do that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	I just got my PSVR, finally after months of it being sold out everywhere. Just like the media reports fake news. IGN and others have started writing fake reviews. This game is great and just as scary (so far) as Resident Evil.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/until-dawn-rush-of-blood-review	I don't really understand IGN reviews. They give Call of Duty games that are like the same game every year and at price of $60 9/10 reviews but they give a game that's $20 and something new to the table shit reviews. I feel like it's unnecessary to treat Rush of Blood like it's a $60 game. If it was $60 and short, then yeah the game deserves that review but it's not. It's a $20 game that gives people opportunity to test the waters for the VR.. IGN give me a fucking break, you gave Dead or Alive Beach Volleyball for the XBOX a 9.2. Do developers pay you to give good reviews to terrible games??? -__________-  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	I don't see the point of Thumper without VR. Hell, I couldn't even play the game without the headset on.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	" This just came out on Xbone - so you felt the need to put  up the same tweaked review from 2016 with a summary about the VR experience?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	@BERT0503 It's just a shame they don't get to experience it in VR. When you play this in VR, it takes on a whole new level of awesome.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	@Pete2106 @BERT0503 Yeah, Phil Spencer said VR was coming with Scorpio but that's another Xbox One idea down the pooper.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	@Pete2106 @BERT0503  VR really does change the experience.  I got lost in this game in a way that I don't think I could have otherwise thanks to VR.  Completely in tune with the movements and audio cues - just flowing in the moment.  It was phenomenal.

WOOOOOOOOOOT?!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	Fun game --- definitely not the same after playing it in VR and then trying to play it without.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/thumper-vr-review	I am awful at this game. But hey, it's sweet.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	After this I'm really considering buying the PSVR. Also because there are bound to be other good VR titles upcoming I suppose, if not already out there. Any suggestions about getting it now or waiting? If you're a troll and you know you are.. don't bother replying.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@MoJaKh Wait. It'll probably go down once the initial curiosity dies down, and the fad starts to die. That's if you even still want one. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Warpchaos @MoJaKh Yeah I was considering that but some of these titles are just too enticing to wait you know
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@MoJaKh @Warpchaos Meh. Most of these are just glorified tech demos.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Warpchaos @MoJaKh well maybe not all but some atleast look and sound great. I think i'll still wait a month or two
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@MoJaKh @Warpchaos Yeah, you should wait. There are so many bugs, anyway.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	I picked one uo a month ago and love it! My friends and family all have big smiles on their faces each time they visit. The only problem I have is not able to buy farpoint with the aim controller. You know Sony never does a price drop on their products before 2-3 years. Thinking back to the psp and vita. To me, it's worth it. Good luck with your choice, my friend.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	I am going to love this game. I could see myself losing hours to this shit lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	I'm ready for Ace Combat 7 to come out so I can see a dog fight in VR
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	I ordered a psvr from Amazon last night. Can't wait to use it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	whattt i cant find any for sale even on amazon
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Sonic10158 you might be waiting a while - probably be lucky to get it before christmas now
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Sonic10158 I ordered one from Amazon as well, should be here in a few hours actually. I'm definitely picking this up, rigs, battlezone, and maybe Batman VR just to let friends and family try out VR when they come over. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	upon first look of the article SuperHyperCube, for some reason my mind went back to the late 90s Sci-fi film Cube.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@twerkstaloak Well the sequel was called Cube 2: Hypercube.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	Best game on PS4
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	IGN needs to step it up and review a good game like Rigs or Eve
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	"I present you the power of PSvr...look how its raw power handles the cpu intensive process of......colorful lines and cubes?????

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Sad_But_Truth A good game is a good game... also.... not all games look like this. What kind of gamer are you? Shame. Shame on you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	So I'm assuming you buy all the 9.0 games, no matter what they are, just because it's a good game???? You don't have to post an answer...we already know it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Sad_But_Truth He's right ans you're wrong.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@midian_9 @Sad_But_Truth he's not a gamer, just a shill. Spends hours a day trolling PSVR articles with the same nonsense. Would be sad to observe, if it was actually worth the effort to feel for him.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Sad_But_Truth Buying good games just because they're good games? Oh, the horror.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@Sad_But_Truth what are you 4?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	got mine last night, i really dont get all the negativity with it, tracking and etc. IT IS AMAZING!!!!! and works perfect for me!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	@chachiboi2 Hoping and praying that mine makes it to the UPS store today for me to get off early in time to pick it up after work.  It's in my city but if they deliver it too late for me to be able to pick it up then I'm going to have to wait until tomorrow.  Pile of games with no way to play them until then.  So incredibly excited though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/superhypercube-review	Today. I will be playing this today. THE EXCITEMENT IS REAL!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	London Heist is amazing! It is so fun with the move controllers doing the little things like manually reloading ypur weapon, picking up a cigar and lighting it with your other hand. Picking up a cell phone and putting it by your ear to listen. If there was a game like Skyrim or something this vr could take off. I promise you can not have an opinion until you try it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	"Im gonna wait for one of my friends to get suckered and buy so i can try it.  I got suckered into buying the kinect so im done with this ""new"" way to play games."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	Should be a free download or for $5 from the playstation store..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	"pffft the usual tech demos... seems to be a trend with VR ""games""....."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	@SickSantaClaws Things nice and short, because they know people will quickly get bored with it after 15 minutes. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	Unless your playing resident evil ... long and awesome in VR
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	Meh, reviews r overrated. My PSVR is sitting at GameStop w my name on it. Cant wait to play Robinson The Journey, London Hiest, RIGS, Eve:Valkyrie, Paranormal Activity, RE7, Allison Roads, Final Fantasy 15 and some.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	I really do hope that people do pick up the VR products early on. The problem alot of new tech has is that we, the public, overhype it to an unobtainable level expecting the first games out to be on par with current gen experiences. yes there are examples of people who have modded games like battlefield to work with rolling 360 degree treadmills and realistic gun peripherals but your average studio cant make promises like that, which is why the first games we are seeing are mainly on rails or limited in scope. To ensure VR reaches its potential it needs corporate to see that it can make money, otherwise it will not be adopted in future
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	What the hell has Studio London been doing for the past five or so years? This is the only games they've released recently and it's just a collection of five tech demos. And, from the sounds of it, not even a very good one. Sony's first-party studios are known for being really solid, but I'd say they're clearly a weak link. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	"Just bought PSVR (will get it next week in my home) :-).

There is also a 18 game demo disc :-), London Heist is cool but those other games are also nice VR experiences/games."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	"vr gaming shit? what a shocker.

i suppose tbf this is more a demo than anything."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	Obviously u don't own one. I thought the same from videos but purchased it to try and the family and I love it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-worlds-review	I wish it included actually ping pong.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	So it's a really expensive piece of crap that you keep in the cupboard and only bring out once in a blue moon to impress some tart you've managed to drag back to your Pad in hope of getting laid.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	:\
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	Is there a way to mute the game sound on the PSVR earbuds and only use earbuds for chat? I can't figure out how to do this. When playing with friends online, it's hard to hear them talking. On my regular PS4 headphones I have the option of chat only, but not when using the PSVR earbuds.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	I'm surprised by all the positive reviews after purchasing the PS VR. The reason being is that I already owned one of the cheap VR headsets that u can use with your phone from Amazon. I thought the cheap $20 toy was so neat that I couldn't wait to try PS VR. BUT PS VR is not even that much better than the cheap headset! The graphics on the demo disk are the same and it's not like you can play full ps4 games on it yet. Unless you just have the money I recommend trying a cheap phone headset for VR first. PS VR games are like extended versions of those apps right now with a controller
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	My headset is arriving next week, I'd really love to see a Yakuza VR spinoff since most of the mini games would fit great in a VR setting.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	"From what I heard and read is this. It's a cool experience but the games are really short, not all that good yet and make you motion sick and therefore the price is a little to high for what you get.
Both the ps4 pro and the VR headset itself also seems to be having some issues of overheating and games running at a lower frame rate than the original ps4 a day 1 edition might not be an optimal purchase because of this.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	@TimetravelerZero  Actually, I've had no problems with the PSVR experience, and only one game made me ill, and that was Scavenger's Odyssey, but that had you twisting every which way! Most games are short, but the ones that make you feel like you 'are there' make up for it in immersion. Many games like Resident Evil 7 can 'easily' be vr compatible, which means AAA VR games are on the Horizon. Just played Beginning Hour in VR and it truly is amazing in VR.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	id love to see a telltale game on psvr, some type of shooter, and a game like the sims (no, I'm not joking) 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	can anybody tell me what the benefits are of running this thing on the pro verse the PS four 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	@gkcx2002 I have the PSVR and the Pro and I honestly see very little difference in performance. The only real difference I see is quicker load times for the demo disc. Aside from that, not anything to write home about.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	@gkcx2002 probably little difference. i tried it on both the standard and pro
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	"Hey guys.
I have recently got the PSVR and absolutely love it.
So much so in fact that I have set up a YouTube Channel dedicated to it and its games.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/playstation-vr-review	I own Playstation VR and must say that my most pleasant surprise is Eagle Flight from Ubisoft.It is a full fledged vr title with story mode as well as 3 vs 3 multiplayer for only $40.The free vr movie apps in the playstation store are excellent and I hope youtube supplies an app for their 360º videos soon.Overall very happy with my Playstation VR and the best is yet to come without a doubt.Honorable mention to The free jackal assault vr experience given free to all by Activision.They need to make a full game because the experience is an awesomely fun tease.Looking forward to Star Wars X- Wing VR.Eve Valkyrie is fun but Star Wars is..Freaking Star Wars.I do not feel like I overpaid for my vr bundle.If you think $500 is too much to have a virtual theme park in your living room them by all means wait.I waited 7 months and was not disappointed with my preorder.Only game I have difficulty stomaching is Scavengers Odyssey.Other than that everything else is very playable for me.Users of vr must treat vr like reality for certain games like Battlezone and Eve Valkyrie.If you spin your vehicles in a circle back and fourth or over and over expect a real world sensations in your stomach like you would in real life minus the g forces.Play smart and you will have a blast.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	This review is off in many ways.  For one she does not even mention the music, which is incredible.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	@dcast75 Without a doubt!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	"Finally finished it.

This was one of the best games I've played in a while. Probably my favorite on Wii U (I have BOTW for the switch so doesn't count). It's up there with Mario 3D world for me. Clever, pun filled dialog the whole way through, and if you use the advanced controls, the gameplay itself is a lot of fun. Huey ends up being a pretty great character. Everything about this game was on point! 9+ at least.

You fight a steak... literally...like the meat.... nough said."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	@HelloSparkle Fun game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	"Just discovered ""Paint Hunt"", what a fun minigame.

And, it's in the latter part of the game, but any Classic-Mario fan has got to play the Green Energy Plant level."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	@Loqu That was one of my favorites!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	 I've mostly stopped reading reviews all together before playing games. They can shape your view of a game and how you'll sub-consciously judge it, before even playing it. Hearing other peoples critical opinions can be disconcerting before trying to experience a game for the first time. I have really enjoyed this addition to the Paper Mario franchise. I have played all of 'em!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	@Bummer.Man I think longtime fans enjoy it more. We know what to expect and know that with each Paper Mario game there are new surprises.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	" THIS GAME IS GREAT, VERY RELAXING TO PLAY. I FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT SUPER MARIO SUNSHINE.

I have played all the games in the Paper Mario series and I am thoroughly enjoying color splash! There are many winks and nods to TYD's charms that remind me of why I love Paper Mario. Beautiful and colorful scenery, fun gameplay mechanics, great music and snappy dialogue. However, Mario will forever be ""The Great Gonzales."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	@Bummer.Man I really enjoyed it too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	Just finished Piper's story. Melancholy turned somber, but it was great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	Now 3 big stars in, and still think this review is criminally underrating the game. It's fantastic; please don't let this review from getting it. If you like Nintendo quirkiness and polished game play you'll love it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	The thing with Paper Mario Color Splash isn't the main story isn't really the big focus for me, I think it's bread and butter (in terms of story) are the mini chapters for getting the mini paint stars, this is some of Nintendos best writing. There were times when I genuinely laughed out loud. The obvious story is saving the Prism Fountain stars, but I think the mini stories along the way that makes the jouney to save the Paint Stars a complete joy
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	"The dramatic rendition of ""Row, Row, Row Your Boat"" in Fortune Island is genius."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/paper-mario-color-splash-review	"Just finished the Lost Sea Pirate adventure, really cool. This game just keeps changing it up.

The whirpool resolution made me laugh so hard."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	You have to get a bottle of whiskey and then go play tumble or headmaster vr for the PlayStation vr. It's epic .worth my money plus I love watching Netflix on a 200inch vr screen it's so fly

I ended up totally in the world and acting without a second thought as to how I would do it.

Having said that, this is not in any way, shape or form a 7.5 if you compare it to similar scores for other games.

I mean it's like IGN have a different scale all together for VR games.

It's fun but it's limited."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	"@gamer4f42d9304c162 Forget the number rating. A 7 means ""good"" the reviews are not meant to be compared against all other games. You can't compare a fighting game to a racing game can you? If you need help understanding how the reviews work, contact IGN. I'm sure they will help you."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	"@pa_amb_tomaquet @gamer4f42d9304c162 Well aren't you a smart a**e!

The point of a review is to help the reader make a decision about where to spend their money. In this case they are saying this is a good way to spend your money despite the fact that it is a shallow, short, limited experience that is more novel than actually being a good game.

Maybe it shouldn't be compared to other more traditional games, but if this is an experience worthy of a 75% score then I obviously have different standards to most people.

This is the game you load up to get your non-gamer friends to experience full VR for the first time. It will have no other longevity at all.

Also this is a cut down experience from the Vive because of PSVRs limitations which suggests the Vive one deserves an even higher score. It's just nonsense.

The game is a 5-6 tops and mainly for the novelty factor."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	These graphics look like something from ps2. Wow 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	@Tankbusta04 Is that the best you got? Funny...one of the biggest games in the world right now has the graphics of a windows 95 game. Maybe you should learn what stylized visuals are before running your mouth lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	@Tankbusta04 That's a very youngster reaction.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	I was reading some stuff on this game and apparently this version isn't as fun as the PC/Vive version due to the inability to move around the areas like you can with Vive.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	How many VR games are IGN gonna give a 7.5?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/job-simulator-playstation-vr-review	"I think the concept of this game is going over people's heads. It's in the far future and robots do EVERYTHING. so they are simulating what they think it WOULD be like if you had a regular job. Which is hilarious. and tons of fun!

To me, Job Simulator is the Wii Sports of VR. I show it to everyone that is curious about VR and everyone understands it right away and loves it. Sure, it's not an epic 80 hour adventure, but it is a highly polished experience that helps people ""get"" VR."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	I loved this app. It's not a game. It's a music visualization app. It's worth it because you can play your own songs through a USB flash. This app allows you to enjoy your own music with amazing vr visualizations. Imagine sitting in the middle of a collection of winamp visualizers. That's harmonix music vr. Imagine being able to sculpt in 3d and watch it react to your songs. I am disappointed by this low review.

I don't know if that is why I enjoy it so much. I find the game so relaxing and dreamlike. It's like hey lets take a magical journey through time and space
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	Just so everyone knows, you're sort of supposed to take this game on drugs. There's a reason they call it the trip lol. Just know it's way better than a 3.5 when under the influence.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	"I thought the Easel part of the demo was fun and I'd love a more full featured 3D drawing app/game, but the rest of this (based on the demo) was pretty idiotic.

For a couple of buck the Easel would be fun to draw in, but I don't think I'd even bother with the other 3 parts."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	"looks and feels like a boring tech demo....  is there actually a ""killer VR app"" out there yet?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	@SickSantaClaws Yes, it's called VR porn.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	@SickSantaClaws Best so far is Rez Infinite and Star Wars Battlefront X-Wing mission, but they're both short.  There isn't a full-featured game out yet.  Most things you play for a few hours.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	Thank you Ryan, I was going to pick it up but I can tell from the video footage that the game probably isn't for me at full price. I'll pick it up when it isn't $25.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	@ERiceJB It's $15, always has been. It was a mistake on his part.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/harmonix-music-vr-review	@Symdawg @ERiceJB  That makes it easier to swallow, 5 months later.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	Nearly 2 months on and the review still isn't finished. Wow that much be a lot of multiplayer to work through.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	"So I own a bar arcade and own two PSVRs and most of the available titles.
Battlezone is by far the best. The graphic style allows for easier vr. The ps4 is cranking out 120fps to make 60 in each eye. As a launch title using this style allows them to make a smooth playing game. It looks very clean and even better on a PS4Pro. They achieve scale on a terrestrial environment like EVE does in space.
That is a highlight. Smooth. Drive club will make most people sick and RIGS is just not there yet (aside from the ridiculous hour training). The tanks hover and slide which keeps your stomach in place.
The map is a bear. Yes, there is a straight path to the last level. Take that route by yourself and you are doomed. If you collect enough credits working through the map, you will have a well beefed up arsenal and tank.
Single player is only good to unlock weapons. That's about it. It is meant to be multiplayer. Then you can heal/revive teammates, target artillery for teammates, and survive. Having multiple tank classes mixed really cements the team aspect needed to dominate.
The AI does something I have rarely seen done well. It will track you and fire shots in the direction you may possibly evade. It knows where you are and tries very well to predict where you are heading.
Keep the faith, the are releasing updates and I think a real campaign."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	The greatest thing out now, and the reason why VR is the future of gaming... I had my huge room surround sound on (screw the headphones). This was better than any super arcade system I ever experienced... AWESOME!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	Hey IGN....I think you forgot to finish reviewing this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	@Bobbythebb eight days later.... I'd have to agree.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	"back in the 90s, sony had this tank game that looked extremely similar on pc. You could play it with other people while waiting for que or raids in everquest.

It was an epic game. Hopefully this is like it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	@B_Will_D I remember that game Tanarus... You're an old man like me lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	Game is very fun in VR. Can't wait for my headset to come in so I can put more time in other than what I played at my co-worker's place.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	i want this one cus it looks like tron
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	Wait, this is a $60 game? Wow... I thought this was like a $15-20, that's what it should sell for on the PC. How do they have the gull to charge $60 for a shallow game with limited graphics? Man they are just really sticking it to PS4 owners, of which I am, but I was planning on getting this on the Rift, but not at that price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	For the love of IGN please finish BATTLEZONE review!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	@HAMMERSTICKS  I don't know if they can hurry it up because the game launches on Oct 13th and they're waiting to test it online with other humans.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	"Damn how much more time does the reviewer needs in order to get this 3 hour game review out there???

and judging by the comments, there are ""lots"" of people looking forward to it...lol"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	@Always_Right How many hours is Rocket League?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	@QNoir @Always_Right what does that have to do with anything?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/battlezone-vr-review	"@SebTheGreat84 @QNoir @Always_Right
His point is that it's an online game, meaning that it's about repetitive online play, not necessarily about how long the single campaign is."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	"played the story, cant call it a game as such as it doesnt feel like a game, after which i dont feel like doing all the riddler crap.....so much more could have been done here, all this dizzyness reduction is codswallop, we have driving games. we have flying games and rollercoaster games.....this game just cuts the best bits in a lazy half assed way....
.this blinking to the next point is a huge fail.....huge batmobiles and bat jets and we can only look at them??? come on!!!.....as an introduction to vr its passable but this is way too diluted, many of the free experiences are a lot more fun and playable."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	 OMG if Rocksteady didn't make u feel like Batman in the previous Arkham games this one will just make ur dreams come thru, unlike the RE7 demo which made me so motion sick. They kept this game limited in movements on purpose so u won't feel sick and the controls are done so well. Just wish they have more DLC for it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	The visuals are amazing! everything is so detailed, this without a doubt is the future of gaming.holding and building 3-d puzzles. Watching people fight in front of you. Forgetting that you are in your living room it's all amazing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	your review is very exciting
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	Not a Batman nut - love the movies and the Arkham games but never read the comics .... Loved this though. Especially the sewer cage scene at the end! Jumped out my skin!! Sounds boring but solving jigsaws in 3D is surprisingly cool. One major worry is file size with these VR games. This weighed in at 9GB ... Its really only 4 scenes and the movement in it is point and click so its not like a scrolling virtual city. Think the dream of a virtual city to explore is still a long way off. Amazed by this though!! 8.5 for me!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	Played half hour so far. One thing that disappointed me was the exclusion of travelling by Bat Vehicle. After playing all the demo games the best, the ones with most potential were the tank game and the space dogfight style game where youre in the cockpit. Feels amazing looking around and seeing the control panel and windows etc .. Picked my vehicle in the Batcave, rotated it around then opted for Batwing... closed my eyes .... THEN ... I magically transport to an alley!! .... WHAT HAPPENED TO RIDING through Arkham IN THE FRICKIN BATWING!!!! A massive oversight. Apart from that really enjoying what ive played so far.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	"terrible review, dont listen to it

one of the best VR experiences, enough to get my friends to buy their own PSVR"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	What a shallow and lazy review. Dancing in front of a mirror was the most fun you had? Really?! How about getting to see through the eyes of World's Greatest Detective? Ugh. Seriously F you IGN and double F you Dan Stapleton!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	"VR is awesome...the experience of being Batman is awesome... but I have a VERY specific complaint about this game.  You're in the bat cave and you get to select a vehicle.  You get to see these awesome vehicles and feel the excitement of ""holy crap I'm going to get to drive the Batmobile in VR...this is a dream come true"".... then the screen fades to black, you hear an engine roar and you arrive at your destination.  WTF Rocksteady... holy Bat Blue Balls "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	@DCTsmash hahaha, that's pretty specific
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	For all the nay sayers, you need to experience VR before you dump on it. I can tell you that I took the risk of it without playing it first. I can say whole heatedly that it is 100% not a gimmick and is absolutely the future of gaming. Videos cannot even replicate a fraction of what its like to be in the VR World. It is an experience like no other. They nailed it, all they need to do from this point is fine tune it. The PS VR and games I have purchased were worth every single penny.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/05/batman-arkham-vr-review	@Noxiic78 Any tech that the U.S. military finds useful will be the future.  Motion controllers still ways to go but the visual aspect of VR feels very mature already.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	I love these episodes. And Colorado is the hardest stage yet. I think they were trying something different here. And IGN doesn't get that. Also a very good story.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	"I am new to the Hitman franchise. Right now I am playing Absolution on 360 and loving it (Except when my save got corrupted. Now I'm backing my saves to usb.).

From what I've read Absolution is about an 18hr game. I like to take my time, so I'll probably have closer to 23-25hrs. Even 18hrs with massive replay is totally worth it.

That said, how many hours from the start of the first episode to end of this episode are you guys averaging so far?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	@cosbyspuddin79 I think the average number of hours in this game will vary greatly. You can really dump 30 hours into one level if you want to explore all different scripted hits and get inventive with some of your own. Or you can just look at the opportunities in the menu and breeze through the whole thing in a few hours if you want. This new game, and most other hitman games are better than absolution.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	@cosbyspuddin79 Play Absolution offline if you do not want another corrupted game save. It took me 3 attempts before i figured out its when it communicates with the servers it wipes the data..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	"@mrs1nister Thanks for the tip. I was actually looking into that, but I just went with backing my saves up to a usb drive. 

It was just one area that was giving me that problem (Dexter Laboratories mission where you assassinate the one legged scientist). But, I'm still backing up my saves just to be safe."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	I can't play this episode or the game at all anymore. Since the update that came with this episode release, all the text in the game and menu regarding opportunities and intel is jumbled. Just a bunch of glyphs and empty spaces. Not starting the whole game over and wiping save files, they better patch it somehow.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	Loving this game so much, i can put around 10-15 hour per episode so safe to say its packed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	This is to me one of the hardest missions to do (IMO). Anyone know where the scarecrow disguise is at?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	This is the last episode, right? Now I can wait for the physical release and buy the full experience on sale.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	@allstar738 This is what I would like to know. I appreciate the episodic approach to games, and in-fact would sometimes prefer it. However, I want the Netflix version of this one. Just give me the lot, and let me play it when I want.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	@allstar738 Japan baby
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	@allstar738 It says right in the review that one more episode is coming.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	@allstar738 Not likely going to be on sale for a while. Actually kind of a clever way for them to avoid price drops ~ a year into release
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/04/hitman-episode-5-colorado-review	probably the easiest one so far, pick up a sniper rife from your smuggled loot box, climb the water tower and fire away, you can kill all four targets that way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	Just finished System Rift.  was a good time. Always fun listening to Prichard and Jenson trade words.  Game play was fun as always and looking forward to whatever is next with the prequel dlc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	Square Enix, software butcher, slicing games into payable slices.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	I think everyone is forgetting the scene where you use the cure to save someone.  The options are use, or save it for later.  However, the game ends 2 minutes later.  Glad they let us save it for later, right...  If that's not blatant enough that the game cut into pieces like a dissected frog then I don't know what is.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	Bah, Deux Ex... I'm so pissed.  I want to support the developers so much, but Square pushes me further and further away.  I've beaten the main game twice on a borrow, and honestly the only reason I haven't bought it is because it did exactly what I feared and got publisher raped.  Now the DLC will go unplayed by me, and maybe I'll pick it up when the obvious Ultimate edition that comes out in a year goes on sale on steam for 10$ four months after that, but hey maybe I'm the only person that sees the pointlessness of purchasing new games now days.  Seriously, I hate being one of those gamers, but if they are gonna screw me, then I will screw them.  Sorry devs, I know you had an amazing game that would have been worth 60-80 bucks for 3 years if they'd let you do what you dreamed, but I gotta chump out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	"You played through the game twice? For free on a borrow? And you're fucking complaining?
It's like ordering the fish tacos and eating all of them only to gripe about how terrible they were. Then when everyone is getting up to leave, you tell them to hang on a second because you want to put in a takeout order for another plate of fisb tacos...and then complaining about them again."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	"@HolyUzuki Well you aren't alone. I haven't borrowed it or played it yet. Given the bad reviews of the missing ending, I plan to wait for a full story before buying. Hopefully they won't cancel the series as a result of their own stupidity.

SE: We tried to screw over the customer base and they didn't fall for it. Instead of fixing our mistake well just stop and look for a franchise with a more gullible customer base."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	"Games been out for a month and we're already seeing oodles of DLC. 

I think I'll wait for the GOTY edition next year."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	@TomatoTom probably a good bet, the dlcs are not even integrated to the main storyline.  They are standalone with a barebones Jenson.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	I believe SE are awesome developers but awful publishers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	@MD_Master Eidos made it, SE published it.  But yah they are awful.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	"Just finished this rather short DLC.  I will admit it's well done, fairly challenging with a decent premise. But it is definitely not worth $12.  I feel ripped off.  This should have been $5 or better yet included in the main game where it belonged.

With Deus Ex: MD, Square Enix have proven themselves to be a bunch of shysters  The main game was half as long as it should have been and really had only one explorable area.  It should have been called ""Deus Ex: Prague Divided"" because you're stuck there for 80% of the game.  And now the DLC's are in effect adding in what should have been in the main game.  Palisades Bank already featured prominently in the main game.  It was only natural to include the Blades mission later in the game (since it is a bit more challenging than the main game PB mission).  System Rift didn't even bring anything original into the mix.  At least if they had set it somewhere else (say Hong Kong, Shanghai, anywhere really) you could give it points for location.  But no, they threw in a new 1x1 square block area of Prague and set it there, with no ability to travel to any of the other areas.

All in all, these DLCs set a dangerous precedent that now Game Devs don't need to sell complete games anymore.  Just lop it in half and sell the other half as DLC.  I am sure their profit margins on DLC are significantly higher as well (ka-ching $$$)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	@tannhausergater more than half the gaming publishers model their games like this. It's your choice to either live with it, play games only suit your standards or quit gaming. Deus Ex MD is 13 hours long, that's a pretty good benchmark and your rant on content is probably not justified. (I havent played the game yet)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	@Drakrami @tannhausergater Yea it always gives me a chuckle how people get pissed about games getting chopped up and sold separately, when the people doing the complaining are supporting the trend by continuously purchasing the things they hate.  It's like nightclubs & bars... why does a bud light bottle cost $3.50?  Because we keep paying the asking price.  Hell they could make the DLC $40 each, and people will still pay.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	"@Dustyn.Barlow @Drakrami @tannhausergater I don't think the analogy fits here because ultimately we are at the mercy of the publisher to be forthright about how ""complete"" a game is.  Usually in an RPG game hours or other ways to describe size or length of the game are selling points.  But I don't recall any mention of even 13 hours being advertised (if I did, I would not have bought).  As a previous DE customer I assumed a decent length game as I would with any RPG or story-based game.  Instead they sold us a partial game and jacked up the price on the short DLC.  

You are right about one thing: I don't have to pay, and believe me I won't come DE: ?? or whatever the next one is.  I'll do what others are doing and wait for it to hit the discount bin.  Eventually the masses will catch on to what's happening too.  It's pretty blatant in this case.  Fool me once...

Contrast this with Witcher 3, or Fallout 4 where the DLC's are an afterthought because the main game is so long and worth the money. To use my own analogy, that kind of DLC is more of a cherry on top of a delicious cake, which is totally worth the $$ because the cake left such a great taste in our mouths. :) But in the case of DE:MD we are being sold half a cake for full price, and being sold the remaining slices at an exorbitant price."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	@Drakrami @tannhausergater Witcher 3, DA Inquisition, Fallout 4, all full and complete games not chopped into pieces for said pieces to be sold as DLC so basically, you're as full of the brown stuff as they are.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	"Honestly, I was just a little disappointed that you only really get one main area to explore through in the game besides the 1-mission only areas where you fly to and back again.

In Human Revolution: I loved going to a whole new city in a whole new cultural setting.

The game definitely has replay value, but just felt kind of short and limited to me."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	"@Jamesisnt I agree.  It's the flaw in the ""Jensen's Stories"" models in that they don't ""augment"" (pun intended) the main game but are standalone. Which sucks not only because you can't explore (like you said) but also all your stats and augs are reset."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	It's not greedy if the original game had enough content to start with. I would understand if the main game was left small as a result but Prague was huge with plenty of content to justify the price
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/deus-ex-mankind-divided-system-rift-review	its pretty obvious this was taken out of the initial release to be added in later for more money in DLC sales. disgusting.

Next two week on IGN : HERE'S WHY WE LOVE THIS LATEST CASH SINK FROM BUNGIE AND WHY YOU SHOULD BUY IT NOW"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	"This expansion was not needed at all.... And it isn't a good one either....

First of all story and I mean main story... 4 mission is what your getting... ok what about the new gear.

IT IS RESKINED YEAR 1 GEAR! Unlike taken king with new models and new gun models this expansion, is all of those models reskined. Awful. Archons forge? Is fun but you need a certain item for it and it's drop rate is awful so what else? You get a raid with re-skined guns from all of the factions and the raid gear isn't worth it. Iron Banner gear? Sorry no it the reskined iron book thing that is better because you can equip shit that makes it look better! The only good gear that isn't reskined is trails, and let me say the trails gear is fucking awesome! Better than last years by far! ( I think you should rock lasts years helmet though). Weapons there is only a couple good new ones but you quickly find most people using last years stuff. Skeleton keys are great droping artifacts, cloaks,bonds,marks and strike specific loot thanks to this skeleton key I got my hands on that fucking cloak of tankis. Otherwise this 'expansion' was not needed and charges you £25 or 30$. Which is not worth it as taken king was 40$ and has way more content gear quests and missions and the raid was awesome. So do I think you should buy it no... save the money onto destiny 2. All you're getting is

Reskined year 1 gear."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	"@ATrustedReview ""Godly"" Taken King?! Are you fucking me right now? That was the most boring expansion I've ever played on a video game. There was literally nothing to do after you beat the story and raid. In Rise of Iron, there is plenty to do after the story line. There are new Plagueland quests every week. Bungie is actually keeping Rise of Iron fresh and plus the hard raid just came out so I don't understand how anyone can critique an expansion like you just did when it isn't even the fourth reset. You are so wrong and blind about Taken King. Lots of people even asked for reskins of year one weapons. If it wasn't for those people, we probably wouldn't have gotten Iron Gjallarhorn or the Iron Gjallar Wing. By the way, the King's Fall raid is the most hell-inducing gameplay in modern gaming. Spelled TRIALS not trails you illiterate shit. Know your facts before you rate a game. Rise of Iron was the thing that everyone was waiting for. The Iron Banner gear was amazing, everyone loved it. Archon's Forge isn't supposed to raise your light effectively, but it will raise it. If the only thing you're doing on Destiny right now is Archon's Forge, then God bless your soul. Archon's Forge is a social event, so it's the same thing as killing a fallen tank or some sort of boss. People are using last year's items because some of those weapons or armor are fucking godly. Oh and by the way, this ""expansion"" is a new fucking year so get used to it or sell the damn game. It hasn't been out since the first big update and you're already hating on it. I can see you being a titan user (noobiest class, I thought that you wouldn't know that)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	@DGriffin02 @ATrustedReview Did you really say noobiest and go after this guy for realizing this expansion was fucking boring and completely not needed? You're a fucking moron and if you ever talked to me like this in real life I would put you in a hospital room for your family to pull the plug on you. GO TO HELL!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	Seriously horrible game. Seriously amazing gameplay.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	Awesome Game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	O come on, its better then a 6.2 when did u turn into gamespot?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	@Korol67 opinions you know how those work? everybody doesn't agree with everything 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	@Korol67 If that dry ass Taken King was like an 8.0 then this shit should be a 10 in my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	they better carry over all my loot and armor so that i  can upgrade it in Destiny 2 - Ive put in enough grind to get to tier 11/12 and I don't want to grind to find my perfect armor pieces gain
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	@elmogunit They aren't... It sucks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	"IMPORTANT NOTE to everyone complaining: YOU DO NOT HAVE TO BUY THIS EXPANSION OR WASTE YOUR TIME PLAYING SUCH A ""BORING GRIND FEST WITH NO STORY"". Okay, that said I came to Destiny late, tried it on release but had no reliable/capable Internet connection, now I'm hard wired on an xbox 1 and I love it. The RoI is pretty weak vs 30 dollars, nothing essential about unless you're looking for a fresh carrot on your stick to chase. But I love the game, grinding is fine, love getting kick ass gear and mowing down fools and pulling off rock steady head shots from clear across the board. Personally I despise PvP and don't touch it and am perfectly happy making due with re-skinned jerks until Destiny 2 drops. I enjoy it, my boys enjoy it if you don't then move along to a discussion about a game that you do enjoy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/27/destiny-rise-of-iron-review	@chainchomper most of the people who hated it bought it year one when it was a bare bones bore and they are still burned. the game was cut up into pieces when it was clearly a full game cut up for more money. which sucks because they game had good gameplay it just got boring as hell quickly

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	They need to hire a UI designer and revamp that abomination they call an interface. Are they so blind that they cannot take inspiration from all the top games that came out in the last 5 years. While we are at it, why not also add higher resolution textures like Skyrim did. But other than that I really did love this game on PC, it really draws you in and you just forget about the graphics. Just fix the UI and control system! Make the battles like Total War or Dragon age where you can pause to issue commands! I hate use F keys, too awkward to reach while in battle.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	"@scipio1st  I played the shit out of this game on PC and once the Viking content came out I lost myself in that as well. Such a good game, can't wait for Bannerlord.

This and Crusader Kings 2 - two games I could legit play forever."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	Even though i havent played this, im still anticipating the next one. I have the pirate version/mod but havent tested it yet
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	@Tomas1980 Unfortunately for you, that's one of the worst Taleworlds games. It's very buggy. Pick up warband, play some vanilla and then a mod like Prophesy of Pendor when you have experience, you won't regret it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	"@K0zha_ @Tomas1980 Yeah i heard, but i actually enjoyed it for 42h... I think some other game distracted me from it.
I really hope that M&B 2 is coming soon, it has become one of my most anticipated games "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	"I thought the controls were very easy to master, though I do find myself frequently skipping over notifications because I pushed A to move at the same time they appear. Still I'm loving having the option to choose between playing it on the pc or on console depending on what I'm in the mood for.
Sidenote: And seriously, ign? This is mount and blade warband..it ain't gonna look pretty and it doesn't have to."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	"I can deal with the poor graphic's and I'm sure I'll be able to master the controls, its rated really good on Steam is that because of mods 

I want to play it even though it looks awful in the video"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	@Shibua It's an amazing game even without mods. The combat is challenging, thee politics are complex, and it really does feel like you are a peon in the fairly sizable world. The graphics are about the most sub-par thing about the game, which doesn't really detract from anything.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	@theavenged95 And if you can max the graphics out on PC it actually looks pretty good.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	"@Shibua  Mods help, but the game alone is legend. I won't like I've cheated a bit and became a one man army with a few companions (to send them out for right to rule). Put on some audiomachine, load up a game, proceed to hack my way through armies and slowly rise to become a King.

One thing I really do love is how once you get a Kingdom and you can assign Lords you see them roaming the map which is pretty cool."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	Just get it on PC, literally a potato powered by a hamster could run it, and the mod support is well worth it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	So I still don't know if I should purchase it. This review was all over the place. It's good, it's bad, this is good but this is bad, the graphics are awful but the rpg elements are great. The 6.8 rating doesn't make a good case either.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	@JimmyC0341 If you want graphics, ignore it. If you want a deep and satisfying RPG, I would recommend the PC version, as it includes mod support, and you can run it on anything short of a chromebook. It has a great political system behind it, plus the game does a great job of making you feel like you simultaneously don't affect the world, and cause great ripples between the dynamics of the different kingdoms in key conflicts and political moves.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	@theavenged95 @JimmyC0341 Well said! That's the sort of review I was looking for. Thanks man! Well said & well done
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/22/mount-blade-warband-review	Tale Worlds should have marketed this game as an Indie title, then most of the reviews would have been 8 to 9! Put on your hipster clothes and glasses and experience the beauty of this magnificent work of art. But seriously I love this game! I couldn't get into it on PC, but now since it works with a controller on PS4 I cannot stop playing it! Fantastic game, can't wait for Mount & Blade 2: Bannerlord on PS4!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	"I got a question, I just played the NBA live 18 demo and it started out with a tutorial game where I controlled all the players, then went into the ""one"" mode where it only let me control one player (one I created) is that normal and mandatory to only control 1 player in the ""campaign""? Is it the same for 2ks my career mode? Thanks!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	I love basketball. And when I see a game with this terrible of an online experience, it disappoints me. When you have a lineup with 8 diamonds on it, you could expect to make at least 2 threes a game. But of course when 2k makes the game, that won't happen. Shots wont go in, there will be constant turnovers, and players will play like they have never touched a basketball before. They seem to have no clue as to what is happening around them. My last complaint is the Blacktop mode. MyTeam Blacktop is extremely unfair. I will choose one of my diamonds to be part of my team and draw two golds. Now there is no possible way to win against a player who chooses a bronze and draws a pink diamond and an amethyst. It just doesn't happen. I wish that the drawing was easier to get a decent player. I am very unhappy with the online part of the game. However, the modes that do not have online play in them are spectacular, such as MyCareer. Overall, this year's NBA 2k was a disappointment for me, only because of the online half of it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	THIS MAN RUBIO CAN MAKE A 3 POINTER BUT I CAN'T BRO YOU'VE GOT TO BE KIDDING ME BRO
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	Terrible game! I have got Myplayer to a 95 overall. I now can't upgrade him anymore because 2K17 is made so you have to play mypark till you get to superstar level then you can go back and get your player to a 99. What if you don't play mypark? And for those who have played mypark you know getting to superstar level takes a ton of time. This isn't a well thought out game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	This is the wackiest 2k ever. Da controls is messed up. Shooting da ball is terrible. I'm glad I didn't buy it this year!!!! Remember it's a game not real life. Mycareer mode is trash. How yu want me to play with a 55 overall player. He get lucky just to make a shot. Im not spending real money on vc's if thts wat yu think
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	"After playing this on Xbox 1 for free play, I am really glad I didn't buy this years Game.. this shit is terrible, 2K12 is still the best game they made. The shooting is lame and the defense is all over the place no control. And the music I listen to so far was R&B yea cause that gets me pumped to ball it up,
It seems like what they did with this one is made it easier to play which is lame.. this shit feels like NBA Live which is weak as shit. Disappointing"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	The rating that gaming articles give there really not even apart of the 2k community
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	"I found this game to be simply terrible. When playing the best team in NBA history, the 95 Bulls against any other team, the bulls can't make a shot and Michael Jordan looks like a bad high school player.  They really screwed this game up. Meanwhile the Golden State warriors team can't seem to miss a shot. So bizarre since the Bulls, Pippen, Jordan etc could destroy any team today.

I'm confused."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	@tmitchem That's some straight up bullshit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	animation isn't the greatest, starting the whole career exhausting. I'm so tired of seeing these stupid videos or Kobe and other crap just to play a game. This alone knocks its rating down to like a 2 for me. Why do I need to watch a years worth of videos just to play the game itself.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/nba-2k17-review	Need to fix the rating how can you be a sharpshooter and ur three point stop at a 92. Need to be at least a 95 it's freaking sharpshooter that's all he supposed to do is knock down threes. Second fix the steal animation when the ball get poke out why is the one that loses it can react faster then the one that poke it out. Come on 2k
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	I know it's a bit late, but whoever thinks that a fucking story mode in a football game, makes up for the unbelievably shitty gameplay should not be writing a review for fifa. Btw the journey was mediocre at best, got hella boring after a while.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	"I have been playing this game since 2011. And i have been a big fan of fifa. But fifa 17 is one hell of a disappointment. I played fifa 16 and it was great, since i played fifa 17 it was a big different game in a worse case.
The teammate bot when you play offline pro is absolutely terrible. They always pass to opposite team or move to the bad position and loss possesion.
The movement of the players are one absolute big disappointment.
And i will be trying PES for the first time this year."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	The last thing that I'm going to do is to buy fifa. Played fifa 15 with only rare gold players, got to div 1, i didn't even have special card, all u needed there in fifa 15 is only skill, therefore, raged cuz others had better(pay to win). Then few years later fifa 17 released, and at that moment, all has changed, the opposite of fifa 15, spent 441 hours to get to div 2, almost every lost is cuz of over rated teams (88+) agiants team with 82 rating.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	"an ""occasional lack of match sharpness""??? are you kidding me. Ive tried so hard to like this game but finally deleted it from my ps4 and threw my $60 spent in the toilet. im going back to fifa 16 its so damn bad"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	OK. Played hours of this. The goal line technology.. when does this get used cause NEVER seen it ! - sorry.. I know when it's used but do you have to turn it on or ... what!?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	Don't ever buy this shitty game, the only good thing is the graphics but that's it.. very buggy, and absolutely SHIT , trust me , it doesn't worth buy it.. too many glitches especially if you want to play in ultimate team.. completely rubbish. Fifa 16 remain the best for me!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	this review is too great for this s**t game, 8.4 is a note to high, at least you have the balls to give 9.5 to PES 2017 who is by far a better football game then this total crap s**t, hope EA Canadistan studio to go bankrupt as soon as possible, because they prove year after year canadiSTANIans don't understand this fenomen, it's like for them a studio from a central african country will start to make hockey games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	I decided to sit out on Fifa 16 since I heard it was such a turn around from 15 and was horrible. I loved 15 and the previous ones but 15 was probably my fave in recent years. So, I decided to pick-up Fifa 17 because of the new engine. Now, is it me or does this game feel a bit slower paced on the field? It just feels literally slower when players run and their reactions and whatnot. Also when you take shots, it just feels off. Not as smooth and fluid as Fifa 15 on shots and in gameplay in general. Is it just me or are others pretty much having the same experience/opinion?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	This game is absolutely awful, I have yet to find a positive thing about it. It is an excuse of a soccer game. The mechanics of this game are horrible, it is extremely slow and boring compared to previous FIFAs. On PC, if you do not own a controller, it is next to impossible to play due to the garbage passing and tackling mechanics and AI controls. They have added virtually nothing new to this game. EA is a lazy and greedy company which only cares about making money off of FIFA points on ultimate team and cares nothing about the other games modes. I would say this is one of the worst FIFA games of all time, nothing but garbage. Do not buy this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	Fifa has improved significantly this year, if you can't see that, you either don't play soccer or you don't play fifa enough to write an article about it. this is by far the best simulation of real soccer. ask a soccer player, winning eleven was awesome but fifa took over ever since 2012. PES is for casual players. Fifa is for futballers
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	@JRjitsy I've played Fifa since the first game in 1994 and this one is no better than last years? I'd say the tackling is the worst it's ever been and it completely ruins the game, Hope they fix this for next years game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/21/fifa-17-review	Yeah keep on spewing crap out of your mouth as if you own PES 2017. FIFA is trash. Boring and unresponsive football.

I've been playing it a hell of a lot and its not getting boring. That's all I have to say about that.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	I actually think that Horizon 2 was a better game. Horizon 3 doesn't feel as focused. H3 tries to be everything to everyone instead of focusing on what makes the series work. Yes, it's pretty, but it has a lot of issues. Game of the year? Not to me, but then I can't think of a game that deserves to be able to advertise that it was branded GotY released in '16. Can we actually not have one this year?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	This is the reason why I want a Xbox
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	Is this REALLY that great of a game? Honestly, I think it's mediocre, but the problem is that all the other racing games recently have been horrible, so this one stands out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	@FortyZombies Yes it is. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	"@FortyZombies Nah you probably just suck at the game, and your bias opinion is showing. You ever think about that?  Because this game stands the test of time and can compete with any racer from any gen.

What type of racer fan are you. More arcade like or sim?  Because if its more arcade like then I know exactly why you don't like this game.  Because this game blurs the line between arcade and sim physics.  That sims physics is what turns people off from it.  Because lets be honest. They suck at driving games with a more realistic physics base to them."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	If there ever was a racing game to win GOTY, this would be it. Excellent game, always kept a smile on my face while playing it.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	Anyone who bought it and enjoyed it. You know, people who actually enjoy playing games and not hating on everything they don't play.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	I own it and play it on both PC and Xbox One and it doesn't deserve game of the year. Not one bit.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	Just the 60fps makes it worth it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/20/forza-horizon-3-review	In fairness, 1080p/30fps hdr costs £200. A maxed out 4k/60fps is costing at least £800- £1000+. There's a massive difference there, your not even getting a £200 pc that plays it at all

Also, where the hell is Bayern Munich? I couldn't find them anywhere and now the entire Spanish league apart from Atletico and Barca is fictional now so more editing to do.

Sorry Konami, last year you were much better than FIFA in my opinion but this year FIFA have killed you. You really need to step it up next year and get all the basics right first before you start making it all about the spectacle. If PES 2018 shows no improvement then you really might as well just stop competing with FIFA. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	Look how in gameplay clips the controller never dribbles around too much til keeps on passing the ball again and again. It shows you how much there isn't such intuitive dribbling or ball controls the FIFA titles offer. The graphic looks nice but that's about all you get with PES titles these days, and not much substance. How the ball flies when shot, how the ball hits the net when scored, they all look so pre-motioned and generic compared to how it is in FIFA. The actual file sizes differ like 50GB to 7GB as well from FIFA to PES, the recent FIFA games are simply packed with more. Other than the evil scheme that is FUT, FIFA takes the win all day over PES for the past like 6-7 years really. Konami really needs to step up their game..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	I hate pes for only one reason it is simply so easy plus you can't override pass or shooting or anything and when you attack and any defender touches the ball he takes it in fifa you can still struggle I know it is hard game for nooks like all of you but I gotta admit maybe pes is better than fifa but I can't play a game like that easy and don't give you all control of the game play plus free kicks and corners are better in fifa
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	@Mouarfm50 i agree they killed PES , i used to love it but not anymore ,i still play it but dont enjoy it . one of the main reasons is when the def take the ball from the attacker the attacker just stop moving !! i think konami should give up..and btw i hate FIFA so dont call me a fan boy
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	im a big PES Fan and i cant understand FIFA .. but this game no way 9.5 .. should be 7 or 7.5.. its 2016 and the game looks like form 2000.. plain , gameplay is laggy online and offline , players act stupid really stupid sometimes , atmosphere is really bad , ref still  bad , missing teams even OF cant fix .. sad konami . i wish i saved my $
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	Not having license to most teams is a huge disappointment!! Seriously fake team names and kits?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	Yeah but is it as good as The Witcher 3? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	Still enjoying this beautiful game. I had the ref booking a cpu opponent for diving! The refereeing and the AI is absolutely fantastic. Gameplay is the best. This is the first time in years am delaying buying FIFA. Am not sure if I really want to this year with Pes 2017 playing this good. Will see.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	This game is just TOO SWEET!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	wow..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/pes-2017-review-in-progress	I played Fifa17 at a friends. It might be the video but Fifa17 graphics look much superior. Only comparing to the video here though - so no fair comparison. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	I actually loved the terrible survivor A.I in the 1st game, it really made for some very funny moments and made the game feel like a B movie (in a good way).  Loved having to hold their hands and drag them through zombies or having an old woman climb up on your back
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	lmao the graphics comparison video did nothing for me. not a significant difference imo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	"Err the Ninja outfit lessens the aggro from Zombies to the point you can just waltz past them. The other outfits in DR2 also had special buffs, the Psycho one gave bladed weapons bonuses, the Jock one sports weapons got bonuses and the Soldier one added gun bonuses.

So not just cosmetic or fleeting. At least know what your reviewing here."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	"Did they improve the attrocious AI of the survivors from the first game?
I remember it being a hell of a lot harder to save them from themselves than the actual game.."

Big mistake."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	@salviatti sadly they didn't improve the survivor AI, still a pain in the ass. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	IGN does not know how to rate these remaster collections. A 6.5 is a disservice to the quality of the games themselves, the unbeatable value and potential newcomers. You don't rate a set like this as if it were a new release.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	@SA87 From actually reading the review itself i don't think the guy had ever even played the originals. He doesn't know about the costume buffs for DR2 or the fact the original had the hit delay on the sledgehammer that he's calling a bug.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	Agreed, I've read acouple and I don't think they get it either. Rereleases are great if you missed them the first time. The extras are..well extras.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	Yawn. At this rate they will have remastered the entire 360/PS3 catalog in the next year or two. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	Then why did the Bioshock collection receive such a high score? It's the exact same thing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	why review a game/games again?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	"@acampydude Good question, especially if they didnt change anything besides visuals. In a sense its the same game which means reviw score is based on age and nothing else.

So this should apply to every remaster thats 5 years and older."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	The 2nd is the most fun and craziest
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	@ValhallaOutcast First one is still the best.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	Off the Record is an expansion? I thought it was just 2 with Frank West.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/dead-rising-triple-pack-review	"@EmperorKoSGolbez Yeah it is 2 but ""what if frank was the hero"" and a few other changes likr who the traitor is, kills a few other NPCs and one boss you find out has a connection to a certain other boss from the first game. Also the story dialogue rewritten to be more about frank being a washed up has been that needs Zombrex than about Chuck being a wondering loner who just wants to save his daughter."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/bioshock-the-collection-review	does anyone know if this added streaming support yet? to work on ps4 specifically. So silly they wont let it be streamed from consoles themselves 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/bioshock-the-collection-review	"Lol, this reviewer is a moron. Complaining that there's ""no new content"" well, of course not dingus. This is a remaster. you obviously have never played these games prior to this collection."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/bioshock-the-collection-review	"@Metallevile The obvious dingus here is yourself becasue as the first Bioshock CLEARLY demonstrates, you can add new content to help spice things up for people that have already played them before. Just becasue its a remaster doesnt mean you can't include new content like the director commentary reels. The fact that so much attention was payed to the original and barely any was paid to Biochock 2 and Infinite was disappointing. I agree 1000% with that aspect of this release and I have been a HUGE Bioshock fan since the original. This review is spot on. 

HD remasters do not have to be just about updating the graphics. Anyone not understanding that fact is in fact a moron themseves. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/bioshock-the-collection-review	While I love bioshock games,I'm disappointed with IGN for not mentioning that bioshock 1&2 crashes sometimes also bioshock infinite has terrible stuttering frame rate issues through out the game.This is a poor remastered and bioshock infinite is a disgrace with the frame rate how it is.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/bioshock-the-collection-review	"After playing BioShock 2 again I have come to appreciate it even more. It has the best gameplay out of all the BioShock games and the story really resonated with me this time and echoes some of the issues going on in today's world. Do yourself a favor a don't skip it just because it's considered ""the worst BioShock"" by the masses. And yes, Minerva's Den is just fantastic and goes down as one of the best pieces of DLC in gaming history.
FUNZ FACT: Minerva's Den was priced $10. Burial at Sea offered a comparable experience (maybe slightly longer) and was priced at $30.
One more FUNZ FACT: Horse Armor which was ridiculed as the worst piece of DLC of all time was priced at $2.50. Today $20 skin packs are a thing and most likely in at least one of the games you choose to play."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/13/bioshock-the-collection-review	Bioshock is the best game ever made imo. I am really enjoying playing through it again, I had forgotten how much I enjoyed everything from the art direction, to the voice acting, even the hacking mini game is still fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	"Just got the Definitive Edition for 20$, it's pretty cool so far, but I can see already how it can get boring after a while. 
First time actually testing Play Anywhere, I might end up playing more on PC if the loading times are much shorter. 
Looks like a good 7.5-8 to me so far!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	The score is about right. It's an ambitious game but certain things do not fall into place well. When I first started the game, I felt like things would have worked out better if the screen was closer to the player. Also, when it comes to combat it tries to do what games like Vanquish do but it's not perfect. You get the feeling that if they would have had some testing with some random gamers before finishing the game they may have refined their ideas and created a better game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	63 on Metacritic.  Microsoft can't compete with Sony or Nintendo with exclusives. They're in a different league.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	@Pcgamer212 Yeah, looks like great first party titles is not their priority.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	Take Rey from Star Wars, throw her into a 3D type Megaman game, and you've got ReCore. I agree with much of this review though I'd still rate it a bit higher, possibly a solid 8.0 for sure. Backtracking towards the end to find more prismatic cores in order to finish the game is the only part that takes away from the whole experience. But everything else is beautifully done, this is old school platforming and exploring done right - which is what ultimately makes it all worth it. I've played my copy equally on PC and Xbox One, and PC is definitely the way to play if you've got a decent rig, it looks better and loads faster. X1 isn't horrible compared to PC, it holds its own fairly well outside of loading much slower and slightly less details, but yes you do notice the few differences. I got this as a digital download for $20 bucks during Black Friday and it was well worth it at that price. I look forward to an eventual sequel someday.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	Love this game, feels like a modern take on an old-school NES/SNES platformer. Great pickup on Black Friday sales too!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	Agreed, picked this up during Black Friday for $20 bucks and just got around to playing it, it sucked me in for three days straight until I beat it and found most of the prismatic cores. Enjoyed it way more than I thought I would.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	I really had high hopes for this one. I love trying out new IPs. And this is usually in my list of games. But come on. After all this hype this is the best we got. Another broken game. If at least the objective system would direct you in a way you can follow we would be able to continue the campaign. After a while that you have been running in circles with no idea where to go, this game gets put in the bottom shelve. Too bad I really believed they had a good chance with this one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	@JASONJBEAUPRE what hype?  virtually no hype at all for this game.  Plus, how do you guys let hype ruin game after game after game for you anyways....seems is if you guys would learn some self control.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	"Eh, playing it, it drags out the same tired old stories Inafune has been telling. Replace the characters with Roll and Rush, don't even change the character personalities, and it's a straight up megaman game. It even has the same ""misunderstood loving robot creator"" with the ""robots gone rogue due to AI/special robot"" from the Megaman X series.
I can't play the game without seeing how derivative it is from Inafune's older works, and it just makes it disappointing. As I pick up audio logs and listen to the lore in the game, I just wish more and more that Inafune would come up with something new for a change instead of dragging out the same tired old story to retell it from another angle."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	How can this game have a high score? The game is broken. Im stuck on a mission and I can't progress becuase the objective system is broken. I have to start a new game after grinding to build my bot up/

Problem number 1: You said in most schools ""across the globe,"" but the source you provided was for schools in the United States only, and high schools at that.

Problem number 2: Your exact reference, that of a B- being 80 to 83%, is, as quoted by your source, ""a grading system used by three different colleges in the United States. Other schools use different systems, so this is by no means universal.""

You really should have read your own source more carefully.  In any case, I was referring to colleges."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	"@trevor_moe @Tierborn @SolidAshes

lets get to the bottomline for you 70 - 79 is a ""C"""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	"The fact is that were not sitting in a school when were playing video games so there's no reason to use that as a basis for scores. If you think 7 is average the that makes 60% of all games 'below average' or crap. And then only 30% above average. 5 is in the middle of 10 which means it should be considered average and below 5 is less than average and above 5 is above average.
Anything else doesnt make sense mathmatically. However that doesn't change that people would like to see atleast a 7 or higher to spend their money on a game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/recore-review	"@Tierborn @trevor_moe @SolidAshes  Those are some easy classes for a C to be that high.  In any case, my high school and college had a C at between 60 and 69%.  At my university, all my classes were curved, so a C+ was usually the grade you got if your percentage was the class average.

IGN has their own grading system as well; games are scored ""amazing,"" ""great,"" ""good,"" etc. first, followed by an appropriate number.  In this case, a 7 score means it's a ""good"" game according to IGN.

Why people ignore this, I don't know.  If their schools issue grades as yours does, that might be one reason why, but grading systems are less universal than either of us thought, so who knows."

In the college I went to, a 70 was right between a C+ and B-.  In my university, a 70 was a C- in some of my easier classes, and an A in my fourth-year math classes.

Trevor, you are trying WAY too hard.  Grading scales are static, and may have some variation if you are grading on a curve, but 70%-75% is not a B in any way shape or form in the US.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	Mutant League hockey: best hockey game ever. Runner up: nhl hits
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	One of the worst games i have played... as much as EA would deny it there is soo much ice tilt in this game they did nothing to fix any kf these problems the only thing they do each year is improve graphics,rosters, and add aome stupid little creative thing... the worst hockey game i have ever played
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	Very bad game. The shots are not realistic at all they are like 10 year olds shooting a puck. It is embarrassing to how hard the shots are in the real NHL. You can pretty much dangle through a whole team which is unrealistic. They never really hit the team play spot where you need to move the puck around with the AI. Hitting is good. Game pace in Head to Head is embarrassing. It is very slow to the point were its boring. You can very rarely beat a player wide. For example Drouin, one of the fastest players in the NHL. He is very good in real life. You don't notice him in this game nor his speed. Same thing with Larkin and Mcdavid. It is almost as if it's in slow motion
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	NHL 2016 was horrible. Did the same dev team make this one?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	Looks good, can't wait until this gets released on the Nintendo Switch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	you forgot to mention the horrible goalie controls
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	Now bring it back to PC so I don't have to play NHL rebuilt :-D tried modding 09 to the same level as NHL 04 Rebuilt this weekend kept crashing and dieing! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	"The only thing I do on this game is play EASHL and drop-in online games. Overall, I think it's really good. It's mostly enjoyable to play, which wasn't always true of previous versions. Here are a couple of things I don't like, though. Keep in mind that I do like the game, and I'm not here to bash it. It's more like some constructive criticism for EA.

First thing is, the drop-in system is kind of junk. I love that they tried to make it better, by forcing you to pick forward, defense, or goalie before you enter the lobby. That was a good idea, in theory. I will say that it seems to cut back on people that pick D and really want to play offense. You don't really get ""stuck"" with a position you don't want. However, if you pick F when you go into the lobby, you usually end up in a lobby with 3 forwards on each side, and no defense or goalies show up. Then everyone quits at the last minute. To get into a game of 6v6 you'll be better off going in as a D-man at the start. Otherwise, you won't get into a full game, and there is a high probability that your game won't even start.

Secondly, one of the things my friends and I have done on every other version of the NHL franchise is play 2v2 with our online created players. For years we've done this! It's always fun to battle for bragging rights! With this new drop-in system, there is no way for us to play 2v2 against each other with our online created players. The only way to do it is to create 2 EASHL teams that can challenge each other. The problem is, we are all already on the same EASHL team. So it's just stupid to have to keep creating a new team every time we want to play 2v2 against each other. I can't believe they made this impossible in NHL 17."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	"This game is frustrating. The Hut is terrible as you can't allow your players to heal or substitute the goalies when they are fatigued. 

all in all - not impressed at all. 5/10 - brutal NHL addition. Happy I played my brother-in-laws first and gonna buy Madden 17 instead. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/09/12/nhl-17-review	"""With NHL 16 having accomplished its mission of righting the ship after the NHL 15 debacle""- I had to laugh at the first line.   NHL 16 was a disaster, only marginally better than 15.   The removal of customizable attributes basically alienated 90% of the gaming population, you can see on ps4...the PS NHL population used to be upwards of 30k on any given night.   Saturday night primetime there was only around 1250 people playing.   Having to unlock all the half decent stuff for either club and player is too damn long.   While I agree with having unlockable stuff...the prestige thing is just asinine.   Only a VERY small handful of clubs will even unlock 75% of that stuff.   Make it less about wins and more about games played, and lose the prestige stuff.

BAP is broken as usual.   Your player even as a CHL player should be able to execute the most rudimentary maneuvers such as cornering without losing the puck, which he cant.   Penalties are embarrassingly unbalanced in CPU/human ratio.   Trying to back check while constantly not only being bumped but full on checked by the CPU opposition and not having a penalty called is absolutely terrible.  Meanwhile, if you even remotely graze a player you get called for interference, which is even more than maddeningly frustrating.   In the defensive zone, its like you are constantly killing off a 7 on 3 because at least two of your AI teammates CONSTANTLY throw the puck back into offensive traffic, or turn and skate it right to the opposition in the corner.   They refuse to utilize a breakout at all.   IF you manage to get a pass out of the zone, AI defense is basically like a Berlin Wall with a 20 foot reach.   They poke from about 12 feet away and not only does the puck get force pushed off your stick, it then magnetizes to theirs defying laws of motion and physics.
    Pokes from way behind you not only dislodge the puck, but again zip right to the defending player.   Shots are blocked from behind you somehow(Not even close).   You can still tell when your opposition is going to score, when every defensive maneuver you perform kicks the puck right back to the attacking player.   Seamless puck pickups STILL dont work at all.   9 of 10 times the player will get knocked down, your player just freezes while the guy gets back up and picks the puck up.   The forcefield bubble pushes you off of hitting players when you have them lined up.   the ""late backcheck"" neg feedback seem to appear too quickly. And they need to lose the ""bad line defense"" feedback BECAUSE it is not my, nor my line's fault that the goaltender lets 4 beachballs in a game on floaters even a tyke player would stop.

One thing they did get right was the skating, to a degree.   Pivoting and stop starts are like skating through glue and ridiculously slow compared to the lightning quick AI.   Overall the skating is more fluid and momentum based which I like.   The gameplay itself can feel like actual hockey with a touch of scramble to it around the net.
Im on the fence with it...Ive played more BAP than anything, and Im usually an EASHL guy, but there simply arent enough online players to recruit from sadly.   Id give it 3 Gordie Howe elbows out of 5.   Much to improve for next year.   That's my honest opinion"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"Why are the reviews from IGN Italy and the US so different?  I can't read Italian but they gave it a 9.5.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"It may be that the Italians are a bit more biased toward their own? I have put quite a few hours into thr PS4 version of the game and tend to strongly agree with the reviewer.
As a simulator it's actually brilliant but in the game department it is sadly lacking and as a result I would probably score it no higher than 5/10.
Additional to the reviewers comments regarding the AI and rules implementation, the career mode is bland and uninspiring leaving your only options for racing against AI to be race weekends and quick races. Due to a limited quantity of cars, ""same class"" quick races end up with vehicles not even closely competetive, stacked up to race each other. You can thus choose prior to the race if you want to win or lose.
Though the engine and tyre sounds aren't bad, Assetto Corsa can learn a thing or two from Project Cars in this department.. This shortcoming also detracts from gameplay fulfillment, which is the only reason I am unable to experience an immersive experience in Gran Turismo 6, which by the way has appalling engine sounds.
On the plus side Kunos seem far more committed in continually improving and polishing their product than Slightly Mad with Project Cars, the latter which have stopped support more than a year prior to the release of their next game in the franchise."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"I feel like I should give my 2 cents on this seeing all the comments. I have been an avid racing game fan all my life, Gran Turismo was my favorite series back in the PS1/PS2 years and Forza quickly came to replace that for me.

Now I bought Assetto Corsa on PC a long time ago (since it had a lot of hype for a PC driving sim) and I thought it was pretty fun for doing a bit of hot lapping with well represented factory spec cars, but it isn't anything that wasn't done better in Project Cars, a game that I really enjoyed but thought could never live up to a game like Forza.

The problem with these games is how they aren't very compelling to play. I mean at least Project Cars has a fairly decent approach to a career but it felt like there wasn't any real purpose in playing through it besides whatever enjoyment you get from it. 

What I really don't get is all the comparisons with Dirt Rally and Forza 6. Both of those games are nothing alike. Dirt Rally is a hardcore rally sim with only a handful of cars, really basic tuning, and it isn't any fun to play if you aren't racing. I like it for a rally racing fix but there is a reason why I have poured hundreds of hours into Forza while I have only played Dirt Rally for a small fraction of that.

Basically, get Forza 6 if you want the deepest racing game available today, the depth of it's modifying and tuning presents opportunities for people who like to build and tune custom cars that nothing besides Gran Turismo 6 can even touch. If you want a hardcore sim with cars that feel, handle, and sound realistic get Project Cars, I enjoyed it a lot more than Assetto Corsa on my PC. Assetto Corsa is simply a very niche racing game that can only appeal to the most hardcore of sim racing fans who only use a racing wheel."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"The reason it's got such a flogging on consoles is that it's single player mode sucks massively and it has no private server options... as a PC player of this game, I've over 1000hours online and probably 10max in single or career mode.

Awesome physics won't count for anything when racing shitty bots or doing hotlaps that you can't compare with anyone else. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	AC has the handling down, but it's featureless, the graphics look last gen, and its wealth of cars makes Project Cars look like an embarrassment of riches.  After all the development I would have thought they would have worked out a decent presentation by the time it made its console debut.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"I am a huge fan of AC from the very beginning on PC, and actually I even played its prequel. I still play it as my main game since then. And you know what? The review is spot on.

I managed to go pretty far in the 'career' mode, but it is way too frustrating. Believe it or not, the AI has made huge progress, but the physics are still broken when collisions are involved. With the really fast cars, I usually restart a race at least ten times before being able to actually get into it without being kicked out in the first lap. Cars don't fly out of the track at the slightest bump in real life, especially if you bump in a car in front of you.... This is the worst aspect of this sim. Makes racing a pitiful experience, especially compared to the old GTR2 on PC.

However, I still play it: there is nothing out there where you are that close from the real thing when driving. Due to the complexity of the physics engine, even the slowest cars are interesting fun to drive, unlike every other car game! If Kunos could turn this magnificent car simulator into an actual game, it would be absolutely awesome!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"A 6? Really? The most accurate and realistic racing sim that's ever been released and you give it a 6? Meanwhile score the Forza Horizon games close to 10?
You're not a real sim racer, you only played the game once it hit consoles."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"@PrivateJoker17 Physics aren't everything, remember. If this review was only about how realistic the driving emulation is compared to real life, the score would be very high, and Forza Horizon wouldn't do as well. When judging the game on its overall merits, however, a lot more comes into play.

According to your presented logic, games like Mario Kart, Outrun, and F-Zero should never have had the audacity of being released since they're nowhere near as realistic as Assetto Corsa, but all of these games were received insanely well with players because of how fun they are. Likewise, the Forza Horizon series has always focused on fun over realism, and the games in that series excel at that.

Yes, Assetto Corsa has realism down, perhaps even better than iRacing and all the others, but there is more to the success of a game than realism. I'd love to see the development team update the plethora of issues plaguing the rest of the game and make something that's truly as fun as it is hardcore. :)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"@PrivateJoker17 You read the text, mate, or just the number at the end? I stressed several times the driving experience is largely peerless on consoles but it's derailed by AI issues, half-arsed presentation, hamstrung multiplayer, and much more. Put your toys back in the pram and stop pointing fingers at strangers and making assumptions about whether their gaming preferences are ""real"" enough for you.

And of what relevance is Forza Horizon to this discussion? Does my love for Crash Team Racing disqualify me from enjoying F1 2016?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	"hate to say it, but could it just be that this game is not for the reviewer...based on this from the article - "" if I’m not within striking distance of the lead group after a couple of laps I’ll just restart. If the AI wallops me off the track, I’ll restart. If I fluff a braking point and spear off into the gravel, I’ll restart"""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/31/assetto-corsa-ps4xbox-one-review	@ewells32 You're taking that out of context; I choose to restart because Assetto Corsa is unimaginative in its career progression (podium or piss off, basically). Games like Project CARS and F1 2016 have way better goals, where you can fight for a whole race in the middle of the pack, come home with, say, a top 10 finish and still meet your team's realistic goals.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/26/worms-wmd-review	This game is pretty much broken at this point....framerate drops to 5fps constantly....which shouldn't matter much in a turn based game, but it does because it slows the game down so much.  What used to take 10 mins for a game, now takes 45!  The AI is so bad, worst ever....there is an annoying delay inbetween turns, 95% of the time during a game it is the game just switching to the next player.  Maybe they will fix it, but I don't know....seems like they just took the worms 2 engine and added textures and effects it couldn't handle....or they took the worms 3d engine and put a 2d game inside of it.  I have never experienced such a bad running game with this simple of graphics....its sad really.

In this case it's purpose is to not upset their market base or feel backlash of the many anime fans. This game is boring, it is literally the same exact thing over and over repetitively. The stages aren't even creative. It's like being locked in a room with titans and executing the same moves over and over to defeat them. Once you got the system feel of locking on and hitting just right.. that's the entire game!

I loved the anime, but this review score is solely to displace fan's backlash and preserve their market. (5/10) If you don't agree, fine. This is my opinion after playing and again I love the series. I guess after spending $60; I expected more to the game play and story line, or at least some creativity besides one locked in area after the next for my hard earned cash. Maybe a little more fan fare? Maybe some interesting story points that weren't covered in the anime? A new character with back story? Varied mission that had different objectives? Nope, none to be found. (5/10)"

Only lazy people would pay cash instead of unlocking them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/24/king-of-fighters-14-review	so i just bought this game... but every match i get online is laggy as hell. its not my connection either... i been playing madden 17 online all week

SNK vs Capcom: SvC Chaos"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/24/king-of-fighters-14-review	@StBatricks @BASSPHUQ Actually they didn't, that game was made by SNK.  Capcom made Capcom V Snk 1 and 2.  Personally I like Capcom's version MUCH better, SvC chaos was a mess IMO.  So yeah, I was asking for Capcom's 3rd version.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/24/king-of-fighters-14-review	@StBatricks @BASSPHUQ No not really, I don't think you understand so I will clear this up for you.  As long as Capcom's name is first (CAPCOM vs SNK, and not SNK VS Capcom), then Capcom was the developer.  I assumed you understood that, you can google that anytime you want.  I was simply making a comment about liking Capcom's version better, do you understand now?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	"Haven't played an F1 game since it had Murray Walker commentating (2001?), so can't really compare this with any previous versions. I've been playing Forza, Gran Turismo, Project CARS, Assetto Corsa and a few others in recent years.
What I can say though is that this is the most realistic racing game I've ever played, and actually makes the ""racing"" in Gran Turismo look like a children's fun fair ride."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	"F1 2016 perhaps has the best handling I've ever seen in a racing game. It is really hard to play with all the assists of and with manual transmission; but the game earns the right to be hard, I've spent hours on Time Trial mode before getting into career to master the handling without any assists. It feels like Dark Souls games in a way, the long learning curve is addictive and rewarding. Once you start learning how to handle the car, you really start to feel as if you are a F1 racer. Codemasters have brought easily the best F1 game ever made.

It's not perfect though, the graphics are extremely dissapointing. It's weird to see a bad looking racing game in 2016. The graphics is not even adequte in F1, it's just bad. I can only imagine how amazing it would be for F1 2016 to combine this top notch gameplay with jaw dropping graphics. My second issue with the game was the missing historic cars, pilots and circuits."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	Best racing game ever. the feel of the car is so realistic in the turns and cornering...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	This is best best racing game I ever played.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	"At least the game has good racing this year. This season sure don't.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	Got the game yesterday (Xbox One) and, while I mostly agree with the review and the greatness of the game especially in career mode, I'm a bit disappointed by the graphics. There is a lot of screen tearing, even when I am the only car on the track. Is this something that a future patch will be able to address?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	I assume you're talking about the PS4 version? I've noticed this too. It's not terrible but can be distracting.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	How does this game compair to project cars?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	@Njdgamer You mean commercially, or in terms of the gameplay package itself? Because they're not really all that comparable; the F1 series is a focused simulation of the action and strategy of a single form of motorsport. I know Forza in particular is very good at covering a broad range of racing categories and it features F1 cars - and some awesome historical ones too - but you can't play out an F1 career, on all the current tracks, etc. For mine you really need to think of stuff like F1 2016 as a sports game like FIFA as much as it is a racing game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	@Luke_Reilly_AU @Njdgamer I never heard of this series.I'm new too racing games as a whole.Most of the games I've played over the years were either rpg or fps.Bethesda being my favorite for both.Back to the original question.I meant in terms of sales.I should've been clear.It seems like a very good game in its own right though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	@Njdgamer If you want to compare a Codemasters product with Forza then it should be the GRID series not the F1 series. The F1 series is dedicated to F1 alone and doesn't cover all the various other disciplines like Forza or Grid does. Forza is clearly better than Grid though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	@Egok @Njdgamer I see.I also thought grid was good.I just started playing Forza because xbox 1 gave forza 6 for free.It's the best race car game I ever played.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/23/f1-2016-review	Has this got co-op career? Best part of the pre-f1 2015 games. Didn't get last years for that reason alone. Getting immediately if it's in this year.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/19/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review	this rating alone makes me lose faith in ign reviews. this game is a 7 at best. controls feel slow and non responsive. its like they tried TOO hard to make it unique instead made it almost unbearable to play. too much focus on unnecessary crap floating around in the environment  and not how the game handles its self. i dont care if i can pick up a traffic cone or a bucket its pointless. focus on my character doing his job. the hacking is HORRIBLE worst ive seen in any game. aggravating with no instructions as to how to even do it. best bet is to resort to ign for codes for each door which is annoying and interrupts game play. overall. glad i didn't pay for this pos or i would be demanding a refund. and far as being optimized for pc.. 1080 runs as smooth as 4k or should i say as jittery thanks to tons of garbage bein rendered
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/19/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review	I bought and finished this game when it launched on my standard PS4 and 1080p set and I absolutely loved it. I recently returned to this game this time on my PS4 Pro and 4K set and wow what a difference. The game uses dynamic rendering which results in a resolution between 1800p-2160p. Along with a variety of graphical improvements and HDR I was really impressed with the visual upgrade to this title on Pro. Having an awesome time revisiting this title.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/19/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review	"This game is $15 on Steam right now, but the Steam reviews are divided. This IGN review says he loved it.

Sure enough, I ran on DirectX12 at Ultra and pulled 17-23 fps. On a 1070 and 16gb ram. What a flipping joke. I lowered the graphics settings to High, and now I'm pulling 47-53 FPS. What a joke."

The issue isn't so much, it doesn't run at 60fps, it's that it jumps from around 60 to 43 to 27, etc. It's game breaking at that point.

Also, there's no excuse for the developer at this day and age for this kind of thing to happen to a new(er) machine."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/19/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review	I wonder why IGN review is so different from user reviews, even now it is $10 on steam I still don't buy this game

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/19/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review	I picked this up for 20$ and just finished it. Gotta say you are a dip$hit not playing it. Excellent game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/19/deus-ex-mankind-divided-review	@joe5yellow It's worth buying now that most of the major bugs have been addressed.  It still doesn't play nice with non-AMD and non-Radeon rigs, but that just means that you can't auto-config the graphics settings.  The big problem that is still outstanding is the DLC.  The episodes are good, but overpriced.  But the weapon packs are SINGLE USE, which means you better keep a copy of the save file if you ever want to use those premium weapons again.  Put it on your Steam list and grab it when the price drops.

Cyberpunk Stealth-Action RPG Goodness. - Dont get to say that often.

Great Intelligently written story- one of the best in the AAA space for sure.
Immaculate level design, making me wish MGS V had more of this than it's B-tier open world design.
New Abilities are Awesome.
Side Missions are excellent, though would of liked more.

The negatives come down too the fact that the game is certainly shorter than the last. I would say the Main story is a good 7-10 hours Less than the First one. It's more self contained and easier to follow but would of liked more.

Lack of Boss encounters but even when one shows it doesn't feel all that epic.*This probably it's Single biggest weakness in the series*

Occasional but Noticeable Frame-Rate dips on PS4.

Ending for me was a bit anti-climatic, felt rushed and left a bunch of loose ends, which I can understand they wanna make a sequel and DLC etc but the ending did feel like content was chopped off."

I want a FULL game and I'm done with ea games I will only pay for a quality product that delivers...it's why my last current gen game was halo 5....and I stopped playing it after a few weeks it didn't deliver a quality product in my opinion.  Nothing has I think gaming needs to take a break wait for some new tech that will revolutionize gaming in an amazing way....instead we just get watered down crap.  Most so called current games that were once called next gen which was a joke none of the games looks all that much better than last gen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/18/hitman-episode-4-bangkok-review	@davidsworld3 We are in an ERA where gamers care mostly about FPS, resolution, and how realistic the games graphics are. With the original xboxs and PS2, Nintendo 64 and etc. we still had that mindset but gameplay was the number 1 thing on that list. You don't need crazy tech to make a great game, you need quality gameplay to make a great game. It is very simple but we care how shiny things are.

A lot of people on these Hitman comments seem to think they have pretty accurate crystal balls and claim to know what's in the best intrest for these developers (like they actually give a fuck about giving them advice that'll make them more profitable).

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	Worst Madden NFL game ever made
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	I haven't bought a Madden game since they basically bought their way to NFL exclusivity. I loved ESPN 2k. With that said this game yet again reminds me why my love of EA titles is slipping further and further into the abyss. Control scheme sucks, play calling sucks, AI sucks. I got tired of receivers constantly dropping passes and RBs not running actual routes. And don't even get me started on the alleged defense in this game. I will be returning this one ASAP.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	IGN has always praised Madden more than it deserves.  This video review repeatedly says this year's game is improved, even calling it the best version since 2005.  Funny how the rating was higher last year and the year before.  I stopped looking after that because IGN has no credibility.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	Madden will always be one of my favorite games to play
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	Greatest madden ever made but one question....why are the best receivers on each team are mostly lined up on the left side, especially on simple formations...Im used to seein the best recievers vs the best cornerbacks! I loved puttin Antonio Brown on Leon Hall or Julio Jones on Josh Norman, now i barely see that....is there a way this can be changed back to how it used to be? Thanks for a great game by the way!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	"This is a complaint about Madden 16 and 17. Am I dreaming or is Madden playing the game for me. Today was my first time playing multiplayer online using Madden 17. My experience has been extremely unenjoyable. Like 16, for some reason when I am the Miami Dolphins, my controls seem to be ""taken over"" by the computer. For instance, my running back Jay Ajayi takes off running after the ball is hiked but, on many occasions, I am not controlling him. He makes his own cuts and jukes. He also gets tackled when he feels like it.

I thought I was imagining this, so I put it  through the most obvious test. During a game where I was getting blown out by Landry Jones of the Pittsburgh Steelers, I hiked the ball and did nothing more. Jay Ajayi gets through the holes running ten yards a carry. Do I like the fact that he can run like that? Of course, but it is no fun when the QB is also out of my control.

This happened several times, especially towards the end of a game. My QB has thrown to guys that I did not select. Better yet, he is moving around in the pocket, and into a DE without me make that sort of move using the controller. Again, this occurs on both years and I am thoroughly upset with this gameplay.

Plainly, it shows the biasness of the developers. They will claim that they have a really complex algorithm at play in the engine. I highly doubt it; so much of this game I find replicates the players as they are on the actual field. Jarvis Landry is not dropping pass in traffic 75 percent of the time."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	Does anyone really like the pay (more) to play Madden (ultimate or whatever?) spend lotsa money to improve your team? blech.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	So I've been playing madden since the early 90's and I have to say that there are some flaws with the game that just irritate the hell out of me. first, the run game is trash. the running back runs into the blocks or he runs into a crowd of defenders. the WR's cant catch diving or catches in traffic. most WR's in the NFL can do these things sometimes but I have yet to have a WR catch a diving catch. this last patch update was trash too. all they did was beef up the defense and did nothing like fix the run game or WR catching. there is no way that a CB can read what play I'm running which leads me to the next thing, the way the game makes you turn the ball over just to keep the game close. I can have a guy wide open for a catch and all of a sudden the game glitches and the defender is catching the ball. the broken play aspect doesn't work right either. a broken play is when the defense rushes through the O-line and the QB has to take a sack, well in the game it happens on normal pass rush, then when by the time you realize it you get sacked and automatically fumble the ball. this last patch didn't improve anything, how can you enjoy the game if you cant even do the basics or you'll have an good first half then in the third quarter you can barely move the ball then in the fourth quarter everything just opens up. there's no consistency. EA made the game one sided if you like to play defense your good to go but if you like offense you better know the playbook you using or you're screwed. EA focused on to much flash and not enough football, doing jukes, stiff arm and all that other stuff isn't necessary all the time especially when there's no defenders around and it slows them down. there's just too much showcasing going on and not enough football being played. oh and what's up with every time the ball gets swatted from a receiver the ball goes flying in the air just so the defense can intercept the ball, and how is it that a DB can catch better than an elite WR like Julio jones, A.J.Green, etc. EA knows people is going to buy madden but they need to get back to the basics of the game and stop worrying about all the flash. watch some real football games and see how much madden doesn't reflect it. madden 17 needs a complete overhaul because some of the stuff that happens in the game is ridiculous and nothing happens on its own, the game controls how you play and it should be the other way around.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/17/madden-nfl-17-review	@nit34 ahaha I just dropped the game in the shredder. First Madden I've purchased since 2003 so I was expecting... I don't even KNOW at this point, but everything you said is true. The issues wouldn't be so glaring if I were playing against a human opponent but against the computer the game's outright bizarre tendencies are far too pervasive to overlook. After I threw the ball to my tight end and saw it pass through his hands, drill him in the facemask, and wobble to the ground for an incompletion (for the 3rd time that half) I knew it was over. Again though, I'm sure the game would be a blast online against actual human beings, but against the computer it's like Tecmo Super Bowl with shinier graphics and half the fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	"Looks like more of that ""games as art"" nonsense. Will skip this and get the next call of duty"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	I tend to like 'artsy' games, really liked Journey, but after finishing this one I felt very unsatisfied. It plays mostly as a tech demo for 1) It's programmatic undulating cubic backdrops and 2) It's programmatic puzzle piece assembly scenes. Neither present any new variety as you play, so I feel reviewers have been getting way over distracted by them. Gameplay is very limited, it's largely a crude, linear platformer in the sky, with crude controls to match. Most of the time the level design removes any real chance that you'll be challenged or fall, but in the one or two places requiring skill, you'll tumble repeatedly. Lastly, it fails at the one thing it could have embraced - the dancing mechanic. It's useless. Swap in prancing for a run animation, toe walking for normal walking, etc. and you've got this. It's very superficial. So without any real gameplay, a glazed over trope'y story, and nearly no variety or challenge between levels, this one falls flat. Save your praise for experiential games much better than this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	This game is going to be utterly gorgeous through PSVR! I can't wait to play it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	Bauhaus..the band or the art movement?  It would be dope if the game was set to a Bauhaus soundtrack.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	Peter Murphy is god!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	Bayonetta can also move gracefully...Lara Croft too...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	@ocasey80 @SYN1STAR Gigity gigity goo!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	"""It’s like an M.C. Escher painting colliding with Bauhaus?"" Seriously? Does any real gamer know this comparison without Googling it? Art Majors aside...?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	I'm somewhat familiar with the name MC Escher but not Bauhaus and I really doubt most people are, that sentence does sound pretentious as hell I will admit lol. That's what I have come to expect from IGN reviews now though. Short, almost cryptically pretentious reviews without even basic and pertinent info sometimes like even who developed/published the game, number of players, general game length, etc. Gone are the days of informative multipage reviews of substance.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	@CRASSCRYBaBY old fogeys know bauhaus
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	@SYN1STAR Could be taken as pretentious, I guess. But I've always kind of appreciated that IGN writing is almost academic quality and reflects people who are educated, not just stoner gamers who think Seth Rogen is the Shakespeare of our time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	@ocasey80 @SYN1STAR Although I agree that I do appreciate that element of some IGN authors, certainly not all come even close. In fact, it is really just Sliva. And that being said, it is nowhere near academic quality of writing. It is still very much a journalist style of writing (which is not necessarily bad, but academics understandably have much higher standards). 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	@SYN1STAR Knew who Escher was (you'd probably recognise his work too) but have no idea who Bauhaus is. Did seem like an odd comparison. Surely easier (and way more relevant) to compare it to two games? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	@SYN1STAR Video games are a hobby enjoyed by many of various walks of life. I certainly know who both are, and I am not an art student, but art interests me. If you don't know it, then you should appreciate that Sliva has expanded your horizons for art and aesthetics. Having to Google something and learn about it should be seen as somewhat of a gift rather than a burden. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	@SYN1STAR I knew what it meant and im not an art major. Although i did take a couple of design courses in college. Bauhaus was an art movement in europe before ww2. MC Escher is a household name though, like Picaso or vincent van gogh. If you've never heard it, you're probably stupid. Go get yourself checked out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	"@SYN1STAR yup. I absolutely adore Bauhaus ( the band and the design style) and i was a film/ dance major :)

This game was made for me <3"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	Peter Murphy does well as a solo act as well but Bauhaus is king'
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	I'm not sold on the gameplay but I'd love to see what the art team from this game could do with a big budget. Hopefully it'll do well and we'll find out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	I was intrigued by the graceful character animation at first so I bought the game, but less than 20 minutes in was already bored. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	Damn, it looks intriguing but is the gameplay that simple? That is also kind of what intrigues me about the game: the graceful movement of the character. I almost impulse bought this. Luckily I am still hooked on hyper light drifter which is phenomenal.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	"@CRASSCRYBaBY it is very simplistic.
Her animations are great but very limited as is the gameplay."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	That's a shame. Gameplay seemed intriguing but it's hard to get a read on what it's like mechanically from videos.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	"""It’s like an M.C. Escher painting colliding with Bauhaus.""..... Shut up"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/15/bound-review	I have to say that my personal thoughts are that I thought it was good. It is a gorgeous and emotional platformer. Even though it does stumble a bit, I think it manages to maintain its grace.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	Loving the updates :) i've got my own base now and the exocrafts are great fun.  Hello games rocks amazing what 15 people can do :)

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	It has frozen on me a handful of times, but it is also after having let the ps4 go into power save mode and picking it back up after powering it on.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	So many broken Promises in this game. It should have never been released until they added everything. This isn't worth the 60 Dollars.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	I just bought No Mans Sky this weekend. I have heard a bunch of issues. I see great potential for this game to become great. Every game I see that is pushed out is always rushed. When people play it crashes or there is no room on the servers. with all new games there will be updates and DLC's. I would like to see more options to where you dont have to worry about running out of space in your inventory. I have played games that were over in 2 hours and i was like what the heck was that. I feel this game will get better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	Not to mention when you DO make it to the center after all that time NOTHING HAPPENS and you start over! Simply amazing. Hopefully the ASA investigation makes Sony honor ALL refund requests because I'm a little pissed they blocked me on the live chat support simply because I asked for a refund. Load of shit in my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	was his succes built on fake publicity?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/12/no-mans-sky-review	This game is shit just like COD,Destiny.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	Just played it, amazing game, except the controls weren't my favorite
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	Bought this on sale for 10 bucks and also picked up Metro 2033 and Metro Last Light for 7.50..... I bought this for the eye candy and am not expecting very much. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	"Overall, I really enjoyed this game. It did get a bit slow in the middle, but the final act was great. Great artwork, great soundtrack and a joy to play.

I think the 8.4 score is spot on."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	This game brought back memories when I use to play Ecco the dolphin as a kid. Swimming around and just enjoying the beauty of nature under water. I highly recommend this game to everyone. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	@Sir8bitgentleman  I was thinking the same thing! I used to spend ages on the very first part just swimming with the pod
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	"Looks like more of that ""game as art"" nonsense that has polluted gaming"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	"@keytarhero Polluting gaming?  Hardly.  You don't have to play it, so it doesn't affect you in the least.  If it were really polluting gaming, that wouldn't be the case.

Think of it like this:  Gaming is an entertainment medium, yes?  Same with movies, TV, music, plays, musicals, operas, books, etc.  As with each of those other mediums, games can be very diverse.  Some may be visceral, some beautiful, some may make you think, others may make you feel, yet more might just make you bored.  The point of a game isn't always going to be the same.

You might not like games like this, which is fine.  It's not made for you.  Enjoy the games that are and don't worry about the ones that aren't."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	Toxic gamers are really what have polluted gaming
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	@keytarhero  like Journey polluted gaming?  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	I loved this game and thought the controls were great. I'm an oldschool player though and always invert Y. I also got the story the first play through so I think I was able to enjoy it more. It pretty much tells you everything you need to know in the end.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	I like the game. It's beautiful, but the controls suck!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	@Pokeparkranger Agreed, both with mouse or controller :/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	After finishing this I think I would have gone with something in the 7s. The game is very slow, even for a exploration game. It doesn't really feel like it hit it's potential until the very last section. Then suddenly swimming, turning and leaping from the water is a ton of fun. The main game just needs a little bit more speed to it. It's a very relaxing game and I like searching for the various sea life and collectible in the water but in the end the experience is a bit lacking,
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	I like what I see but the lack of depth in gameplay, the short playing time, and the lack of any significant story make it not worth $60 to me. I may pick it up when it eventually goes on sale.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	@blueboy07 to its credit, Abzu is only $19.99 currently.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	@blueboy07 Just bought it for 10 dollars on xbox summer sale.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	"Ok, I made myself finish it after getting bored in the first hour. It took less than three hours total to get to the end, acquiring half the available trophies too without trying too hard.

I have no problem with a short, calm, exploration-focused game. But:
1. The controls are terrible and *never* became comfortable (despite what this review claims). I tried all variations of Normal/Inverted for both camera and player controls, and tried hardest to make the default work, but it's all just terrible.
2. Boring. Not calm and relaxing for long, because you'll be bored, then frustrated. Not going to meditate when it's the tenth repetitive meditation spot and you're wondering how much longer this inanity goes on and how much this game cost you...
3. Mostly inscrutable story. Or else I did understand it, but it was shockingly basic.

I'm sad I bought this--it made me angry in the end. Journey I loved, but this failed."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/01/abzu-review	Having said that...the scenes with the whales and the giant school of fish were genuinely awesome. Just not nearly enough to carry the rest of Abzu.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	Playing this now. Absolute gem.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	Out for X1 now. Highly recommended!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	One of the best games I've played in the past 10 years. Very original with great graphics, fantastic sound, and some of the best internal lighting I've seen in a game. This game is super fun. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	So really no XB1 release?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	"@ThatGuy048 Pretty sure Sony paid them off as part of their version of ""summer of arcade""."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	I'm about 4 hours into Headlander and I'm loving it. I thought I was completely burnt out on side scrolling platformers but I really enjoy this along with Steamworld Heist.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	Why is it that every 2D game is compared to Metroidvania these days?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	@easy_target77 Because of the genre.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	oh another side scroller gets an 8..smh what a surprise
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	The game looks terrible.  I watched the trailer and it just didn't suit my tastes.  Shrugs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	So, did Double Fine just stop releasing games on the Xbone?  Last thing I saw was Massive Chalice.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	Well, gotta go where the audience is. Plus, they have a pre existing relationship from the Grim Fandango exclusivity
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/headlander-review	@SillyWalker55 Nothing to do with audience...has to do with who pays them more for exclusives...  Even with GF, Sony was a big part of making that happen so again, $$$.  Which is unfortunate, considered MS was the platform (Windows) that bred DF in the first place.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	I've had more fun with this game than most other games i've played.  Me and my 8 year old play this as a 2 player game.  He controls the little critter across the screen while i contort myself so he can get across.  We've been having a total blast playing this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	Keep on seeing a lot about how Microsoft is burying the Xbox ones Kinect. The Kinect offers a crucial hands free navigation for my entertainment center. With Xbox one s out now and seeing there is Kinect support is okay with me but they sure as hell better release an update that will allow me to plug a microphone directly into the Xbox so I don't have to have a headset on and plugged into a controller all to tell my Xbox to change channels or turn the volume up. They should release an official navigation mic
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	Congrats on your engagement to Marty, Lucy!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	this game would've been really cool like 3 years ago 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	It sucks because the Kinect was really fun at times. There still is a lot there imo.  They just couldn't get it to read our bodies that well.  I still love the Kinect Sports games.  I still love the Move sports games too.  Frisbee Golf just never gets old.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	Its interesting, but the one game for Kinect that I had such a great time with was this one - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5cuYYm0AHc0
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	@ewells32 That's not just my favorite Kinect game, but one of my favorite games on the 360. There were parts that I had to stop playing because I was laughing so hard.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	@FAIL_TR0LL @ewells32 Exactly.  It was one of the few amounts of highlights that did come out for Kinect
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	I bought this game to play with my boyfriend because his idea of gaming is candy crush. He has only ever completed this game and Portal(at my encouragement). I told him I got a game he would love. He tried it and quit. I went to work and get a text later saying I just beat FRU! It was so fun! I just completed it myself and it's challenging and fun. So give it a try. Never disconnecting that thing because I like voice commands
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	@got99problems Did you two try the  unlockable Bonus co-op mode too? I thought that was a neat addition including that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	Hey they are finally figuring out how to make games for the Kinect. Too bad I'm not into this game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	"Fru is absolutely fantastic and everyone should play it. It is a great example of why all of the asinine anti-Kinect bias that has plagued this industry for the past few years is vexing. We need variety, and in an otherwise stale industry, Kinect provides that.

That said, Fru is not an anomaly. There are more than two dozen Kinect games on Xbox One, and many of them are worthy of recognition. Some of them are absolutely superb (Fantasia: Music Evolved, Dark Dreams Don't Die, Dance Central Spotlight, Fru, and Xbox Fitness [RIP], for instance). Some of them are very good (Fruit Ninja Kinect 2, Kung-Fu for Kinect, Kinect Sports Rivals), and many more are good (Zoo Tycoon, Peggle 2, Shape Up, Blue Estate, etc.)

And this list of noteworthy Kinect games doesn't include the excellent Kinect Xbox 360 games that should've been ported to Xbox One, such as Child of Eden, Kinect Party, Gunstringer, and dozens more."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	"Child of Eden is on Xbox one. How do you use Kinect on that and peggle 2 though?
Edit: mixed Eden with light and now I understand."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	@got99problems You could use your hand to aim the turret and fire in Peggle 2. It wasn't much different than using a controller, though, compared other Kinect games, where motion controls greatly improved the gameplay (e.g. imagine playing Dance Central with a controller), which is probably why most people don't even realize it is a Kinect game. Nevertheless, it's a good game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/25/fru-review	"Completely forgot about this game.
One of the more Unique uses of Kinect."

Think of it more like a turbo-charged 3DS that can also be played respectably on your TV. Being able to play a full-fledged Zelda game during my lunch break at work... nothing compares.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	"@Alphonze-tk Definitely how people should see it. I've had someone compare the console to the PS4 and X1 while the Switch completely matches the description of a handheld console.
My reply was ""If comparing the PS4 to the Switch is valid, that means you must compare the 3DS to the PS4 as well."" and the guy just stopped."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	"@Alphonze-tk @twerkstaloak and thats exactly what im doing ...lmao
 "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	@Alphonze-tk @twerkstaloak Somebody gets it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	@jel0 @Alphonze-tk Thing is though, that's not how Nintendo have marketed it. They have marketed it as a home console you can take on the go rather than a handheld you can hook up to your TV.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	Now how to take my pc with me on public transport... lemme know when you've got an answer bud.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	@equinox9  Ever heard of a laptop? ;P But yeah, would be a bit difficult to set up a mouse in transport.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	@twerkstaloak  As a mainly PC gamer (GTX 1080's in SLI) I am loving the Switch so far! I really enjoyed Stardew Valley but IMO I had a hard time playing on PC. It's a game I'd like to play in bursts on the go. This is were the Switch is going to be perfect for me!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	"@twerkstaloak 4k... is Overrated, this is coming from an avid PC gamer myself.

1080p and 1440p is still where it's at to get respectable frame-rates."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	Sloppy port of a good game...C'mon now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/20/i-am-setsuna-review	its gorgeous on the Switch and a perfect rpg on the go and really shows off the switches beautiful screen! As for the frame rate this is one of those rare games the FPS doesn't even matter because it's a static camera so you can hardly tell the difference in the game. Nor would it make a difference
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	This reviewer obviously didn't play for any significant amount of time or he would know that this is a broken game. SQUAD has been saying a patch is on the way since it was released. How can you give a 9.0 rating to a broken game?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	this game is truly fun I don't have a pc so this the only way to play it Ill give it a 5.3 due to the constant crashes and every reload lags a lot but fixes it self but on a good notw once you figure out the controls and mechanics it become a fun game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	"I want to know why the review doesn't mention the fact that you literally cannot select an object to build without hovering your finger over the X button and mashing as fast as you can (and then immediately deselecting it because you couldn't stop in time).  I would mention all the other bugs reported, including vanishing save files, but I never got the chance to experience them, because I literally cannot do anything.

This game is utterly unplayable as is, and there is NO update in sight.  I paid $40.00 dollars for this?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	Sorry. I was very excited about the concept of this game for the PS4. But this is for PC not a console. It's a very poor port. I had to sit on a chair in the middle of my living room just so I didn't have to strain to read through all the Training material. (At the largest UI font setting.) The game is laggy too often and already crashed once on the first day. To frustrated to continue. Disappointing. I would really avoid getting this game on the PS4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	No way in hell I'm paying $40 for a game that was under $15 for the longest time on PC. It got some attention and they jacked the price up to $40. Plus with the horrific PS4 performance, it's not worth it. I really want to play it, but not at the asking price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	"This is an irresponsible review based on many hours with the PC version but a cursory look at the PS4 port. Until the developer decides to patch it, both the PS4 and XBox versions have these breaking bugs that make it unplayable:
1. Cannot set navball waypoints, so entire classes of missions are inaccessible
2. Game crashes often
3. When the game does crash, your save file may be corrupted and ALL PROGRESS IS LOST

This game may deserve a 9 on PC, but the PS4 version is poorly ported from the old 1.10 KSP code and is just unplayable. Seth Macy you should be ashamed."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	@ubikkibu What does this game control like for the PS4? How do you even build spaceships?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	This game is truly amazing. however not for the impatient or stupid. Ive spent over 500 hours in this game on PC. And have barely scratched the surface.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	Get this on PC only . MODS are so fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	Do I have to see the astronaut character guy in game? lik I dont know why but looking at him pisses me off a bit

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	Your quickness to fly off the handle and make ignorant attacks suggest that you already play it

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/18/kerbal-space-program-ps4-review	The in game text is tiny!!! Cant read it sitting on the sofa.. need to put a chair right in front of the tv.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	"What drove me insane the moment I picked it up was the freezy, jerky graphics that provide about 100 feet of draw distance. At one point, I lagged (I say lagged, but i was playing a local game, mind you) past a zombie and a MASSIVE building popped into view where there had been wide open sky just a couple steps away. Terrible idea in an apocalyptic setting to not be able to see the ominously looming safe haven in the distance. I literally have no idea what's around me. EDIT: Forgot to mention the zombie animations that make it difficult to discern if they are laying on the ground stunned, or dead. Kicking it while it's down? ""Harvesting"" it? Just gotta wait for a HUD popup. Realism at its finest.
Besides the graphics (arguably subjective), the controls for console are abysmal. Period. Too much interface for controller use.
It's a very customizable game that has a ton of potential for me, but The Fun Pimps developed a LAZY AF port, and Telltale Publishing just rode out the money grab.
Do yourself a favor and AVOID the console version and get this on Steam."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	 After watching the 1 Week gameplay video/review, I know why you hated it. You're terrible at gaming. Watching your stats and belt throughout the video, you have no idea what you're doing. It's a relentless game with a steep learning curve. If you're not good at gaming, don't play, and don't review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	Sure, it's a steep learning curve, but that's not the problem. I got this on console, and knew immediately something was wrong. The controls are difficult and the graphics are terrible. This seemed like it was developed for the PC and I was right. It's a great PC game that turned out to be a terrible, LAZY port. The belt is difficult to use, and there's way too much going on with the interface for sticky thumbstick controls. I thought my game was freezy and laggy, which led me here to confirm it. This review is spot on for the CONSOLE VERSION.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	This game deserves to be reviewed again. Of course critics' reviews will be different than community sentiment; However, there seems to be no correlation to reality whatsoever. The 9.0/10 steam rating is a sure fire sign of an enjoyable game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	@xxMASTERV8xx  this is a review of the console port, not the game on steam. if you read the review, the reviewer even says the game has been enjoyed by PC players for years, but the console port was launched buggy and broken. the 4.9 was deserved
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	4.9 was too generous
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	This review is perfect.  Fanboys will defend this game to the end of time, but the lack of direction within the development team is sad to say the least.  I'm not joking when I say it's been over 8 months  since this game saw a content update, and they still  won't give a release date.  Does that sound like good business practice to you?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	"@jmthomas  I'm fairly certain their business practice is just to pay people to do ""Let's Play"" videos so more suckers will buy their never-to-be-finished product for way more money than any alpha is worth.  I sincerely hope they prove me wrong and eventually finish the game since the concept has a lot of promise, but I don't think they will."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	I made an account just to comment on this. This guy is obviously an idiot. The review is just flat out inaccurate. How does IGN put up with reviews like this??
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	@ConcernedGamer768 The PC version is very-nearly unplayable with graphics that look like something out of the late 1990s even on the highest possible settings.  Zombies somehow have more reach with their rotten arms than you do with a club, knife, or even a sledgehammer.  Melee is a completely untenable option for survival (which I will grant makes some sense, but flies in the face of all those katana-wielding fantasies I had).  You can crash it just by choosing the wrong menu item when trying to start a game.  GOD MODE doesn't work, which I'd think was essential for debugging at the very least.  I can't imagine that any console port would make this game any better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	@JTBlum @ConcernedGamer768 Are you sure you know what you're talking about? I have over 200 hours invested into the game, it's actually a lot of fun when you give it a chance. The God mode doesn't work like you would think it would, but if you learn how to use it, it's actually a neat feature. Again it is a cheat mode so you can't base the whole game off of a cheat mode. If you don't like it then don't play it simple as that, as well if the graphics were an issue why did you buy it? Never had the game crash on me because of a menu option either.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	"I don't get it, the game is still in alpha and they release it on console... bad decision, especially since it still has bugs on pc, the game was released in 2013! You'd think they would have fixed them, but other than the bugs the game is addicting, we got a server, found a military missile silo/ bunker and have set up shop. The exploration and survival is sooooooo surreal lol. If you want to play the game, get it for pc, even though it's buggy sometimes and still in alpha, it's seriously addicting. finding items for crafting and fortifying your base is serious fun once you get it all set up...  wear a headset or play with stereo for the absolute best experience.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	This is a very bad one sided review. I decided to try this game on xbox because the actually gamer reviews were really good. The game has so much depth and you just get sucked right into the world. Survival is key and with the clock ticking it really gives alot of hard choices to make. Do you scavenge for that food you are desperate for or do you fortify  the base further as you are getting close to day 7,14 ,21 etc. You start with really rubbish tools and you to grind towards higher gear which is really rewarding, upto day 14 you do nothing but try and survive by improving your stats, weapons and base. After that you move onto things like building minibikes, cement mixers , lead battery lighting and so so much other things. The time really flys when playing this game. The graphics are certainly poor but the game play is fantastic and  if like me you grew up playing mega drives and N64s then the graphics really arent a problem. Highly recommend this game to any rpg lover. Bacon and eggs anyone  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	"Xbox stinks!
GREATNESS ONLY ON PLAYSTATION BITCHES"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	 Give the game a break it was being made since 2013 and it was made on the Unity engine so give it a break.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/13/7-days-to-die-review	@Zombie_Slayer30  Well now there is a brand new one that is made on UE4 called dead matter
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	I don't know if I'd enjoy this game so much if I was new to carmageddon but to me this is EXACTLY what fans of the original were hoping for. I'm having a blast and I really think this game deserves at least a 7/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	it's a good game initially, but when you realize that it's virtually impossible to destroy opponent's car without a power up it loses it's charm. the main point is to collect as much power ups as possible, not to destroy other cars. This worked differently in original carmageddon.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	"I dont know about you guys, but I am having lots of fun with this game!!! I do not care about the graphics, I just wanted a game that I could play occasionally in between my Fallout 4 sessions and waiting meanwhile my wife gets ready to leave for dinner or something similar :-)

I guess this game will be appreciated more by people like me who used to play this game 15 years ago purely because of the mindless mayhem of each race...

Also, what can you expect from a poorly backed kick starter project,? At least we got to have a decent game that is really true to its roots...

Possibly the reviewer focused on any other elements of the equation except for fun factor... IMO this game at least should be a 7..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	"Very enjoyable game - Soon as you start you are right in the action!

No down time, No text reading, No silly side missions

It's simply Action & Carnage!


Great game!
& it was only $70 (Australian Dollars) - so I was very happy with that.
Nearing the end (currently at level 15) I became curious of what others thought and was quite shocked that people reviewing the game often gave it a low score but people in the comments often praised the game saying it was good fun."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	@RTSAvalanche I got it for about $20 us very early on and all the previous carmageddon games were thrown in for free as well. When is max damage released on PC though as i haven't seen any word about it and it's meant to be free if you have carmageddon redo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	"A game doesn't have to be super in depth or complex to be good. Just because you've gotten older and don't find this stuff fun any more, doesn't make this a mediocre game.

""...accurately recreates the feel, structure and sense of humour of the original quite well"".
So it's a remake that checks all the right boxes for fans of the original? Great. Mission accomplished. What more did you want from them?

Now go back to playing your ""grown-up"" games with storylines and character development and leave games like this to people who just want to have some fun."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	@deathmetalgod Its a mediocre game to him, though i cant either see the appeal
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	I liked 3 a lot, but this seems a bit off. I feel like I'm driving on ice. The cars need more grip. I liked a lot of the maps, though some modes could shrink the boundaries a bit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	I will hold back on entering ign again till they bring cons and pros back...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	@LuMaximus I would guess that it has been removed because stupid people thought that thats where the deductions came from in the score
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	@Tomas1980 @LuMaximus but... that... is... where the deductions come in from........ stupid.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	"@JuCstin @Tomas1980 @LuMaximus not really.  Hence the ""there are no cons!  why didn't it get a 10!?"" comments."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	Watching the video makes me really miss Destruction Derby on N64. It was one of the best games no one ever heard of, and I was the ambulance king. It also makes me miss Burnout 3: Takedown on Xbox.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	@Kirigaya_Kirito No ones ever heard of? It was a huge game at the time and the fact it got 3 sequels would suggest it sold pretty damn well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	@stephen_alex_walker I was not aware of that. The N64 version was the best one and Nintendo never got any of the sequels.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	Thats because the 64 version was a sequel. I think the 4th game. 3 on the ps1 and pc, then this on 64.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/12/carmageddon-max-damage-review	"Seriously, man...sounds like you just don't get the game at all.  This game is pretty freakin' awesome. I think most people play it for the sheer destruction and being able to do absolutely amazing stunts. The physics are incredible, the huge maps are awesome, and being able to squash peds is a joy in and of itself.

Horrible review...doesn't look like you put much into it at all.  It almost sounds like you reveled in every snarky little comment."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	I'm about halfway through. The controls are great IMO. Maybe my favorite part of the game actually. It feels properly floaty and slippery. I have no problem taking out swarms of enemies. Some of the puzzles will take multiple tries, but never felt cheap to me. The laser puzzles I didn't LOVE exactly, but they weren't a deal breaker. Maybe the reviewer just isn't a very skilled gamer? 8/10 for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	"So it's a 6 because he really hated the controls, otherwise seems more like a 7 and I LOVED the music in the review.

Cool, I'll definitely buy this and Abzu in a couple of months, I like that developers are trying different stuff like underwater-based games, we need more stuff like that, and games on the sky/clouds, on the Moon, good experiences with a heavier focus on exploration instead of sci-fi action or shooting."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	Got it for free so I'm playing. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	"Couldn't disagree with you more about this Marty. I felt the movement alone in this game was satisfying enough to want to keep playing. Is there a secret standard for reviewing indie games I'm unaware of? It seems you guys pick and chose which indie game is a piece of ""art"", and which is just another mediocre side scroller. Are we really playing these games for groundbreaking gameplay mechanics, or are we playing them the story and nostalgia? I could listen to the ambient music and narrator talk while watching paint dry and enjoy that because of the vibe I get from the game. So, when you add the gameplay loop (mediocre or not) I think it's just right.... Anyway God strongly dislikes you!"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	I'm not going to take issue with the score or somebody's feelings for a game, that's subjective, but I will take issue with the criticism of the controls. There's nothing wrong with them, the sub has just the right feeling of floatiness and inertia you'd expect from controlling something underwater, I don't have a problem with the controls.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	A 6, are you freaking kidding me?!? An easy 8.5, what an amazing game, LOVE IT!!! User reviews please!!!!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/11/song-of-the-deep-review	"At this point it's time for IGN to consider about reader's/users rating. Now I know that a review is a certain individual's opinion. For things like gaming which is quite subjective. 

Now for making an educated guess regarding purchase decision, It would be better to have a collective opinion of both the reviewer & the community. Now just because Community disagree with reviewer doesn't make the review obsolete. They both can co-exist. Just need a bigger sample for making any kind of decision."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	I have a quick question as a returning player to Division. I've only just come back to the game after I stopped playing it about 3 to 4 months ago (had too many games to play at the time). I have managed to gear up so all my gear is 229 and currently level 28 in the Underground. I have seen that you can get items with a gear score of 268 but you have to do the Underground in Heroic mode, however when I choose a Underground difficulty I cannot see Heroic Mode, do I need to be level 40 to see it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	Easily one of the worst DLCs I've bought for any game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	"I don't get it. The Division and Destiny get ripped for the grind (although curiously IGN praises only Destiny. 9/10 for TTK which isn't better than this DLC at all) but what the hell do people expect. The core mechanics and leveling content for both games are great, exceptional even. Do you think it's reasonable to assume the devs are able to churn out massive amounts of story content to compliment gamers' insatiable appetite? Gear grind is how end game works for online games.
Also, the amount of free content added to The Division along with the DLC, since release, amounts to a lot more than Destiny had in its first few months, not to mention there was more to do right from launch"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	"@lost.at.sea I am heavily inclined to agree with you, but Destiny had its perks and downsides. Early on, yeah, not a whole lot of end game content. You had the Vault of Glass (the only raid in Vanilla Destiny) and the occasional Iron Banner event which wasn't so hot either, and was the only premier PvP event before the release of Trials of Osiris. It got better with Year 2 and more releases, but with Year 3 on the way, it will probably get better.

The Division got a lot of things right, and to be honest, with them complaining about all this stuff, all I can think of is, why complain about it? So you've seen the environmental hazards a lot... good, that means you know how to deal with them. So you get matched with lower gear score players... good, chances are you are the first person they've match made with in the Underground and you have the privilege of showing them how to do things right the first time. All the things he is complaining about come from a negative perspective. The Division is a pretty good game, but every game has its flaws. This guy's review is just nitpicking at all the little things he dislikes. I'd give this an 8.7 out of 10, because yeah there are some bugs, but those can and probably will get fixed."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	I hardly regret that i bought the season pass for this game. It was getting worst from update to update. First you always have to start from scratch after their updates and second.....ubisoft ( massive) just cant bring anything realy new and exciting. Its always the same procedure. I realy want my money back. I experienced the same with far cry and assassins creed. This was definitly the last game from ubisoft. If you guys want taste of a good mmo. Play the elder scrols online
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	"@Blaackpanther Elder Scrolls online still has a lot of the grindy aspect this game is said to have, and quite frankly, I think it kind of has to be there, since there really is no ""Raid"" per se outside of the Incursions which, in my humble opinion, are too difficult for the players who are well over the gear score required, and abysmally difficult for those who are under the gear score required."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	"From someone who has been there from the beginning, this expansion is far from the failure it is perceived to be. Most of us remember the grind in the Dark Zone hunting for exotics only to be relentlessly gunned down by rogues and have our gear stolen. This expansion handed over the Dark Zone to the PvP players permanently and gave us, the PvE players, a place to reliably farm for gear in relative safety without fear of rogues. It's a great thing to have in my honest opinion. It may be a ""grind"", but I think I speak for a lot of people when I say I'd rather farm with a team for hours and get ok loot rather than risk losing hours hunting bosses all with the risk that I may find nothing good and lose DZ rank in the process."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	He didn't say a single positive thing about this yet it gets 6 points. Where do the 6 points come from? Does each point represent ten thousand dollars?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/07/06/the-division-underground-review	More like, minus 4 points for not paying the reviewer and therefore no positive feedback either, despite it being a good DLC

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	Hi, guys! I'm Meghan and I wrote this review. I know it's late, but unfortunately we had to switch reviewers at the last minute, so thank you for your patience while I played through it. It's a fun game, for sure. :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	"Stumbling back on this article months later, it's really a pity that IGN stayed in the typical expected safe zone to give this game a score that was expected, not the score it deserved. 

Finally we get a bright and colorful game with a truly unique narrative. Unfortunately this game was plagued by skeptics and narratives working against it like ""I hate J-pop, so this game will be dumb"" and ""This doesn't look like a Fire Emblem game!""

These narratives were hard to shake and made this game a hard sell for many fans. The review score seems to reflect a vestigial need to reduce the credit this game gets for being a fun RPG with an addictive battle system. For being J-pop idols, the main characters are surprisingly likable and interesting. The gameplay is very similar to a MegaTen or Persona game, and the Fire Emblem connection makes sense without it disturbing the cannon of that series too much.

It's a shame that even when the Wii U took risks we had the western game media always digging and searching for reasons to slap down anything that tried to deliver fun outside of the box."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	"I'm really enjoying this game. I'll admit, over the last few years I haven't been finishing many of my games. Especially the longer (40+ hour) ones. But I know this game will be one that I do finish.
It's pretty much exactly what I've been waiting for in a single player game. The experience is laid back because it lets you save, and pause whenever you need to. And also allows for multiple save files. That's a comfy feeling to have those options.
So in a way, a lot of the pressure feels off. But it's not boring. When the action is on, it's on. What it does, it does very well. The turn based battles allow you to take a moment to enjoy the great art style and effects. And because they're turn based, you can walk away and return whenever you need to.
This is going on too long and I haven't come close to making my point. I'll just say if you want a great turn based JRPG, and don't mind a little flamboyantly Japanese coo coo mixed in, you should play this."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	The pop idol thing is a huge turnoff to me. But I want to give it a shot anyway, I think. Anyone have any idea how many hours of gameplay there will be for the main game? I would like to try it, but I just don't know if I can justify the purchase, or that I won't hate it when I get it, lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	@Kevbot34 it's 50 hours.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	@Kevbot34 I'd say it depends on which difficulty setting you choose. On Hard there's certainly some grinding to do so it is a bit longer. I'm at 35 hours at the start of chapter 4 ) though the timer still counts the time even when not playing the game, like being in the Wii U menu)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	"@Kevbot34
Playing in on hard, trying to get everything, almost done and have surpassed 80 hours, just like the developers said. 

The game doesn't even focus on being a pop idol that much, more so on the Japanese entertainment industry (3 of your characters focus on acting)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	"I'm having fun with Tokyo Mirage Sessions.  I like the combat, the presentations and even smirk a little at the ridiculous antics of the game's pop idol cast.

I do feel the game is a bit grindy for my tastes.  While the ""Idolaspheres"" are beautifully designed, thus far I've always been more than ready to move on to the next one long before I'm able to."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	I only had to grind for about 10 minutes so far. I only even did that to get a skill that i pretty much NEEDED in order to beat a boss. If you find yourself grinding a lot either you avoid a lot of enemies to begin with initially or are doing something wrong.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	Fucking love this game. The censorship is disappointing, but this game is great regardless
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	Nope, you are wrong. The dungeons are great and a helluva departure from stagnant copy and paste ones we always see. And Bland Story? Did you not play the game? Sometimes I dont think you 'reviewers' play these games for all but an hour because it cuts into your Division, CoD or Destiny time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	@Erisandra IGN has been negative about this game since it was first shown, this review is just them standing by their ignorant opinion. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	@benji101 @Erisandra If you listen to the NVC podcasts, they've actually come around to liking it. Plus this review was supposed to reviewed by someone else, but they bailed the last second.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	Great combat is something we've been missing in a lot of stuff. A cursory glance at this, you know what you're getting into as far as eye candy. I need to try this, especially if bikini clad women are riding waves of nuclear soda! That right there, that's my ish!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	I am pretty surprised that the dungeon and puzzle design gets criticized. After all, it is a huge step up from the random collection of hallways from the Persona series. The puzzles are a nice distraction without being overly complicated. The enemy encounters are easy to avoid so it doesn´t get too frustrating if you have to run around for a bit to find the correct solution for a puzzle. I really hope that Persona 5 will also go in that direction with its dungeon design.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/29/tokyo-mirage-sessions-fe-review	Worth the purchase so far! Intermission complete, on to chapter 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	Second Story the GOAT
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	"for some reason i think this game developers ignores the feedbacks and complaints on the previous games, and when they fix something they ruin another thing.
three things i hate the most here:
1- is restraining us in a small area and one planet, in star ocean 2 we play in 2 full planets and get an airplan so we don`t repeat each area, but here we only have a small part of 1 planet!
2- all the forced repetition, many areas you need to pass like 5 times minimum, and if you want to do the side quests it becomes 10 times, why not just make new areas or dungens!
3- the trademark of this game and what i used to love the most ""item creation"" has become nearly useless here, the drop rates are low and very low for a long time of the game until you do alot of side quests and get the speciality to raise the drop rate for specific type of monsters,and many items are exclusive to some cities ""whole milk"" for example only exists in santerule to the far east, so if you needed some you have to walk all the way there (assuming you remember exactly what each shop sells)

one more thing is all the flashy lights of the attacks, i can barely see the character i am controlling or the attacks of my teammates and the enemy, at least make a choice in config to lower the attack effects so we can actually see what happens.
#makeStarOceangreatagain"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	This game is for like Star Ocean 3 to me. Sure people can complain and say its not 4. But...hey, it isnt. And nor is it 3. But hell this game isnt too bad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	Star ocean 4 has bunny races , Arena , Broken dungeons.. Its a true masterpiece and what we get from Star ocean 5 ? A silly story of a little girl which you cant even use and well atleast we get dungeons but with no puzzles just fights.. Im in 2016 not 2010 WAKE UP DEVS PLEASE 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	Star ocean 5 reminds me Dark souls 3 i mean dark souls 1 was a perfection Star ocean 4 was The best jrpg i ever played in my life i mean the English voices the story the combat the cutscenes oh man i easily  spent 1200 hours+ on it i truly did thats how awesome Star ocean 4 was but Star ocean 5 man i struggle to even spend 100 hours+  on it and the thing that you cant use relia pissess me off truly.. Atleast the dungeons holding it up
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	I love star ocean 5 but it needed more improvement in cutscenes especially and character graphics they deserve to be more realistic not like fake 3D dolls.. I dont know if it was their budget or lack of support that caused this mess but please i cant stand watching every series dying like this from perfect to worse
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	Since they cant create new miracles then just bring the old ones i mean a star ocean 4 remastered like FFVII remake would be great..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	Everything is true i have Star ocean 5 so i can tell it tries to copy Star ocean 4 alot but it does in a very bad way sadly with no awesome  cutscenes the game obviously needed more time to me this game is unfinished 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	The reason some are giving it bad reviews is because its nothing new, its basically like another tales game, where its cliche story cliche special moves, similar save the world crap, gain party members and make friends with them, probably a village gets attacked on your way back from a small adventure in a forest, but you know what sure it could of been better. Star ocean 2 was the best as you can tell from my name it created an impact on my life in many ways, and its storyline was epic with a plethora of things to do and level up on. I say they need Star ocean 2 Reboot HD on next gen console in 3D too. with added dungeons story and characters. Still won't stop me from playing Star ocean 5 Integrity and Faithlessness
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/star-ocean-integrity-and-faithlessness-review	@Dias666Flac Star Ocean 2 needs maybe a true 3D sequel with the same cast? ;) But even if they made Star Ocean 2 reboot in 3D/HD/whatever I wouldn't mind playing that either, I would be willing to buy the console specifically for it. Star Ocean 2 was that good.

Oh wait, they are not evolving, so what's your point hypocrite?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens-review	Best Lego game since Lord Of The Rings. Couldn't put it down until Platinumed

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens-review	"Warning to inverted control players...there is none (accept for flying which makes its absence that much more absurd for having none for camera control). WTF!? This is the first game I've played in...I don't know how long...that simply decided not to add it.

Now I expect some ""meh.. inverted controls suck, outdated, blah blah, I like the smell of my own farts"" comments. But for any gamer like me who has been an inverted player forever, it's almost unplayable for me and I feel cheated out of my money.

Anyway, just a heads up."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens-review	"@iguy78-tk what a bummer!  Thats insane.  To compare that to the standard control tweaks generally expected in a PC game, its a complete disservice to remove a simple toggle like that from their options for a console release.

Also, sure day 1 purchases are tough to turn down sometimes, but heres my trick:  buy used from Gamestop.  I'll go in and buy like 3 games used, try them all out, and keep the one that i like the best.  For example NFS Most Wanted was amazing-- but the damn FPS view stuck the viewer on the front of the bumper!  Like, why did they stick the camera so low?  Obviously, if you're driving, it helps to have a higher field of view, not on a bumper.  Oy.  So that was a deal breaker and I returned it...  Anyhow, that method has saved me some $."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens-review	"@docleephd @iguy78-tk For sure that is by far the best practice to save $$. I never played a lego game, but saw a 9 rating and I liked SW and the humor in Lego Movie and just thought ""ok, this will be a no-brainer...digital download, take my $$"". I need to practice better restraint like you for sure.

I'm going to keep trying to adapt to non-inverted, but it's proving more difficult than I would have thought, and making my experience frustrating."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens-review	"This game by no means deserves a 9... maybe a 7... more likely a 6.5. It is the same Lego Game you've played over and over again, with some tweaks to existing mechanics, while the overall experience has been the same. My wife and I have been a fan of these games as something we can play together but this latest incarnation is resulting in fatigue due to repetitiveness...
- lack of originality
- same poor view interfaces; horrible 2 player split screens and interface
- glitch riddled levels and quests; including one that completely corrupted saved data wiping all progress.


PLUS, I shelled out an extra $20 for this one and there has not in any way been that much additional value added. If I'm paying more for games to cover increasing developer costs, than that added value should shine through in the game. I feel like with this one the developers slapped the game together with tools they already had as a means of making a quick buck and funneled those funds to other projects."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/lego-star-wars-the-force-awakens-review	$80 is to much for a lego game.. sorry ign.. but this is a fail

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	So funny to see the comments range from I loved it to worst game ever. And quit moaning if you bought it solely based on a review and didn't care for it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	bought this yesterday and finished it today.  Blew my mind.  I'm speechless and in awe.  I completed Limbo earlier today prior to starting this, got both on a Steam sale.  This was a defining moment for me in gaming, and I've been gaming since the 80's.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	This game gave me a mixed impression... The visual part is really good, but there was something missing. I got bored.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	"Just finished this game and all i got to say is WTF was this. A 10? ""riveting story"" what? lol this was an acid trip thats bout it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	@xMag1Cx It was pretty much a perfectly crafted game, you could tell it 100% succeeded in what it was trying to do. I'm pleased it got a 10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	"Great game, but too easy.  The ending was terrible.  I'd give it a non-ironic 7.8/10.  If we're talking purely about visual storytelling, then it most certainly deserves its ""Masterpiece"" status.  But since we aren't, it doesn't."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	"Really? A 10? You gave Ryse a 6! That game has an ACTUAL story, much more fun gameplay than this bullcrap 2d puzzle
""gameplay,"" and Ryse has much, much, better graphics.
Not to mention the story is
actually great in Ryse.
Actually, I shouldn't have compared those two. Let's compare it with another indie game. Owl Boy is a much better indie game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	"So since I've played through it, where's my spoiler review that goes more in depth?

Oh yeah, I'm on IGN, they don't have the balls to do that. Nevermind."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	"If you're reading this and undecided about buying the game, I say take a punt and dive straight in. I felt I wasn't playing the game per se, more experiencing it. 

Everything is so slick, and like the video review, I often stopped to just appreciate how much attention to detail went into everything. In my opinion, it's a mesmerising, fun and thought provoking experience, and I am so glad this title didn't go under my radar.

Absolutely spectacular game from a fantastic developer. Well done Playdead."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/28/inside-review	Fantastic game, and amazing sound design. I think I still prefer Limbo, but only just.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/24/umbrella-corps-review	I've heard all the crappy things about it, but they were 'giving' it away this weekend for $7.50. I figured what the Hell. Haven't played more than 5 minutes yet. I guess I'll be using the brainer from what I understand. lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/24/umbrella-corps-review	Or every could stop reading shit reviews an actually try the game themselves. Everyone has there own opinion.

Suggesting you wont trust any reviews coming out of IGN because a single reviewer gave a game a rating you disagreed with is without question one of the most ridiculous statements I have ever seen made on IGN and trust me, that is really saying something as you see some really dumb comments on IGN from time to time. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/20/mighty-no-9-review	Mega Man Legends 3 sounds really good right now...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/20/mighty-no-9-review	the artstyle of this game looks really dumb. the original megaman/rockman games from the NES have more appealing graphics than this game does.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/20/mighty-no-9-review	I was one of those unfortunate backers of this game, and wow..... what a waste of my money. I played the game for 10 minutes until I turned it off in frustration.  Comcept and Inafune had three years to make a great game and this is the result!?!  Any of the classic Mega Man titles are miles better than this shovelware!  It's virtually unplayable!  What a total disaster... The hate is honestly justified.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/20/mighty-no-9-review	I just don't get it. I have now almost completed the game and I don't get the hate. I feel like the levels are more challenging than your typical MegaMan and the bosses a little less, but not easy. When you beat levels it not only gives you new abilities, but the boss assists in a level. To be honest, a complaint I have about MegaMan is that often bosses are super glare but if you have the right weapon they are super easy. I feel it is more balanced. This game has given me those moments when I have died several times and then I beat the boss with minimal life left and I cheer. Framerate got me once, but never an issue. While the graphics are stellar and I feel a cartoony style with anime cutscenes would have been better, I don't look at the screen and think it is ugly. The dash mechanic is important aside from combos. All and all I love the game even though I would not consider it for game of the year. All these negative reviews are not justified in my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/20/mighty-no-9-review	"@TimSanders I 500% agree with you.  I'm one of those people who is legitimately enjoying this game A LOT, and I honestly don't get the hate at all....

Plus, those of you hating on this game need to keep in mind that they released this game on 10 different platforms.  That is INSANELY ambitious.  Inafune-san himself said that the majority of issues they encountered were born of cross-platform problems.

Could there be improvements? absolutely, there's no such thing as a PERFECT game (except maybe Ocarina of Time, which still holds the lofty title of getting a perfect 10 here on IGN; or skyward sword which ALSO got a perfect 10)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/20/mighty-no-9-review	"@TimSanders You don't get the hate because there's literally no REASON for the hate.  Read through the review above again and try to find the author giving any actual reason for anything.  Their one complaint that maybe might be valid is that they don't like the art style.  Which is fine.  It's not to everyone's tastes.  I certainly have always thought that Beck looked rather unfinished, like some sort of half-built prototype.  But the game isn't an eyesore by any means.  Just look at the background on the Capitol Building level (Countershade's level).  The author's other complaint?  That they found at least one or two styles of combat that they really took to and matched their playing style.  The problem is, that's something that a game should be praised for, not complained over.  I'm personally quite fond of Batallion's weapon, though I would've liked a mode that let us use the gatling.  My brother, a Zero player since X4, prefers Brandish and will literally trash EVERYTHING with it.  But even if these were valid complaints, that's still no basis for a 5.6/10 rating.

One starts to wonder, with all of these really low reviews from critics, but primarily good reviews from users on sites that support such, if there isn't something going on.  I mean, surely THIS MANY PEOPLE who do this for a LIVING can't be this incompetent, right?  It's the conspiracy theorist in me, I'm sure, but I can't help but ask if Capcom isn't involved in some way to make sure this thing fails since they can't sue Inafune into submission."

The shooting isn't as bad as the lousy reviewer is saying either. The only parts that drag are the jetpack levels, and there's only 2 of those. I was surprised at how much I liked this game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/17/trials-of-the-blood-dragon-review	"The reason Fry Cry 3: Blood Dragon worked is because it wasn't a parody, it wasn't making a bunch of references and saying ""hey look I just made a reference"" like your typical Family Guy episode. FC3: Blood Dragon worked because it felt like an extension of the games I played in the 80s, like if the Commodore 64 got twin turbos and style/music didn't really ever evolve. It was awesome for that reason. If this game however is going after a bunch of 80s references, then it can go f itself since they get boring really quickly."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/17/trials-of-the-blood-dragon-review	@bigrod69 It was really well done but it did get way too samey before the end was reached. Just a problem with Far Cry open worlds more so than just Blood Dragon it's self though. Just not enough variety. However it was well priced unlike the main games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/17/trials-of-the-blood-dragon-review	@deviltaz33 @bigrod69 Well it way too easy too, but I still had no issue getting to the end of it - like I never got bored. I absolutely loved the look and the music and the cut scenes, just an A+ game for the money. If it was $60 I'd feel different, but I think it was $12 or something when I got it.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/17/trials-of-the-blood-dragon-review	Finished it, and it has some nice and funny 80's vibes and great effects going, but overall i was a bit disappointed. Wish they would just make a proper Trials game again, and not one with all these strange gimmicks like shooting, walking on foot, swinging and gravity stuff.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	Hahahaha, never trust this reviewer! He rates this higher as Alien: Isolation? Hahaha, fuck off, little twat
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	To be honest, I didn't know about Mirror's Edge until the Announcement Trailer came out back in 2013. Seeing that made me buy the original game, and I played the crap out of it until Catalyst came out. I was a great game, but that is nothing compared to Catalyst. I love this game! I have over 200 hours on it, and I love every second. I can definitely say that this game is on all levels a far better game than the original (and believe me, I have 150+ hours on the original Mirror's Edge, and as I previously stated, 200+ on this one). The story, and the graphics (while flawed at some points) are greatly enhanced in this REBOOT (not prequel, as the critic stated). If you read up on all your lore and got all the collectibles, you'll know that this game is way deeper than the original. Why this gets a lower score than the original? Beats me. The views in this game are absolutely stunning, and it is so fun to just roam around and beat people's time trial scores. The combat is also a huge improvement. If you properly learn how to use the combat in this game, and use your environment, you can be a total badass (but of course, you have to be good at the game). Overall, this game gets a 9/10 from me. I would really like an extension of the story and an expansion of this beautiful city.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	@Memo_Rex I'm about to revisit the game for another full playthrough.  It's a brilliant open world perfect for parkour.   I'll be trying to find all the collectibles and such this time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"""Fun fact: you won’t see a single smile in this entire eight to 10-hour story campaign (more if you fill it out with sidequests) until Faith finally cracks a grin in the post-credits scene."" 
M8, I literally screenshoted a dozen of moments from the game where the characters are smiling or loling or smiling is implied. That in on itself tells me this review is bullshit and misrepresentative. You should have someone else review the game and rewrite this because there are people out there who think your one-man reviews are the word of god. MEC is not the perfect game, but it's far from ""okay"" (I won't even begin with how retarded the rating system is because you're not the only ones guilty of using it).

""A city as bland and devoid of unique and interesting landmarks and hazards as this one""
Judging by your previous ""fun fact"", I'll assume you didn't pay attention for the gameplay part of the game either. The city is very beautiful, it's full of landmarks that help you navigate, you just have to get to know them (obviously). 

Another thing I want to point out is how remarkably illogical it is for this game to have a lower rating than the first one which, while it was a good game, it is not nearly as good and fleshed out as catalyst. It literally makes 0 sense."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	I agree because I finished a mission and came back and was put back about an hour back!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"Soon I'm about to do a second full playthrough for this game.  Absolutely criminal to give it less than an 8.0.  I give it a 9.0 myself.  Most of what he's complaining about is not something anyone would care about or be paying attention to.   I just don't get basically giving them no credit for what is clearly a huge step forward for the IP, or pretending the first game had some kind of masterful story, combat, and character personalities.  It didn't come close.  It was adequate for the purpose of the game...parkour.  And that's exactly the same for this game.

The open world in MEC is fantastic.  After finishing the story missions, there's so much still to do and explore.  You'll triple your play time at least, making this one of the longer games out there.  But then if you factor in all the user generated content that you can create and share or try from another player, you'll actually never run out of something to do.

The one drawback is it does sacrifice some of the adrenaline moments since you really can't give the AI the same lethality.   Otherwise, they would just snipe you every time from the next rooftop.  You take a lot of hits in this game with the open world.

Another good step forward is Faith's combat moves.   She's far more agile than in the first game.  But the problem with that is it exposes the AI badly which was not a good combat AI in the first game either."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"I've just completed the campaign in this and was thoroughly underwhelmed. The story was dull, the combat was terrible and clunky, and the parkour was boring.
The first game was better because it was linear, and you didnt find yourself running the same paths over and over. I am just glad that I didn't buy it and got it with EA access."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"@TheManInTheSuit ""it was linear"" and ""you didn't find yourself running the same paths over and over"" are two contradicting statements. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"How is that exactly?
Linear = single path through the game, no backtracking.
Running the same paths over and over = something that happens in an open world game like this."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"@TheManInTheSuit If you're running in the same path over and over, then that's your own fault.   This game is about finding the best path from point A to point B, and it's rarely repeating the same path over and over.

In fact the only part that might be repeated is the fact the open world is split into two areas, with a connecting area in between.  So you will run through that connecting area if you need to go from one main area to the next, but that's it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"I have to agree with Ryan. Although i feel the score is a little too low. I would give it an 8.
I miss the purity of the original. Making the game open world and stuffing it with collectibles was a mistep. (Pun intentional)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"I hate to agree with a Ryan McCaffrey review, but he's right, this game is a huge letdown.  If anything he was way too generous.  This game is bad.  Every character you meet is more annoying than the last, the world is utterly lifeless and boring (not in a cool, futuristic way either), the ""combat"" is stone cold simple (if you lose even ONE fight in this game you should quit gaming), there's nothing to encourage you to do any of the boring side missions and the main story is just dull, predictable crap.

This game doesn't even rise to the quality level of a free-to-play game.  I'd give it a 4/10 at best.  Do not buy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"I read this review thinking I might gain some extra insight into the game as I just finished the story about 10 minutes ago. But apparently I forgot that IGN is the place to go if you want to see good games get tarnished just because the reviewer doesn't like things that any average player wouldn't even bat an eye at. This game was extremely enjoyable and held my attention throughout. The beginning was slow and a little dry sure but it was ultimately a satisfying finish. Funny how the reviewer claims to be ""One of Mirror's Edge's biggest fans"". No...you're not. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	Just picked this game up for $45 cant wait to play it. The majority of people in the comments are saying its a good game, im going to trust them more then the review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	I have to agree with everyone except the reviewer on this one; In my opinion ME:C is a masterful sequel in every category, and a unique, supreme quality game all on its own. 'All the games are belong to me' yet I can't put THIS ONE down; It's a unique and beautiful flower amidst a sea of violent, samey, bullshit. Despite art being subjective and all that I've been playing all types of games for over 2 decades - trust me this isn't one to miss (especially if you're a fan of the original).

PS; I'm sorry, shouldn't have assumed you'd read the Great Gatsby and know what I'm talking about (at least you've googled it now!), but I couldn't be bothered to do additional research into your stupid internet alias. If you think Initial D is childish anime then, yeah, sure. Why not. (Years ago) a younger me identified with the theme of that show and one character in particular. It inspired me to pursue my dream and start auto racing and drifting in real life. Got a problem with that? Wanna make fun of me?"

1. None of your numbered points are examples of me being hypocritical. The Witcher was irrelevant to the discussion until you accused me of playing Call of Duty in an attempt to imply that I only dislike Catalyst because I like dumb games. (btw saying that you think that the protagonist of a game is boring, is the very definition of a criticism)

2. ""I don't even know where to start with how STUPID this supposed 'clarification/argument' is."" More generic and baseless comments to cover up for the fact you cant come up with a valid retort.

Oh and more hypocrisy from you, accusing me of ""deflection"" in the same paragraph where you say ""The rest I can't be bothered to address"".

All of the characters in Catalyst were shallow and clichéd. The relationship between Noah and Faith was empty. The three or four conversations they had did nothing to give any depth to their relationship.

All Dogen did was shout a few times. How does that make him a badass? What's so special about Plastic? The generic socially inept / quirky nerd character that has been done hundreds of times before?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/06/mirrors-edge-catalyst-review	"@TheManInTheSuit @keiisuke So much BS ...

1) Yes, you f**king muppet, those are absolutely examples of you being hypocritical; It's not my fault you don't know what hypocrisy is or how it applies to your ignorant ass. Also I didn't imply that you only like dumb games I implied that you are closed minded, which you absolutely are as evidenced by the closed minded opinions you've shared. COD isn't a dumb game. Most of 'em a pretty fun and they're at least technically competent (unlike Witcher3), which if you remember (you probably don't) was my primary criticism.

2) Valid retort to WHAT!? Seriously. Nothing you've said that I haven't already addressed is worth addressing. It's not that I can't think of anything. You aren't worth it. Period. Simple. Holy shit.

""The rest I can't be bothered to address' is not deflection. Deflection would be turning the conversation in another direction so as to avoid a good point you'd made (you didn't make any). I REALLY THINK YOU SHOULD INVEST IN A DICTIONARY. A good and relevant example of deflection is me pointing out your hypocrisy and you responding with 'none of your examples of my hypocrisy are actually hypocrisy'. That's a brutally childish attempt to DEFLECT very factual observations about your behavior."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	this will be a fun game to play .... sometime next year after all the episodes have been released and the price has been cut 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	I remember this level from Silent Assassin, all of the guards were turbanators. LOL.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	I really hope they're getting poor sales due to this episodic bullshit. this needs to stop. the last hitman game was brilliant but this is simply stupid. A really crappy way to force longevity.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	@awesome_game_r I actually find it an interesting experiment. I think this is the first time a big game has done it. This is keeping the game relevant for much longer. Mostly after a game comes out it's never talked about again. I mean if you hate this structure just buy it when it's finished. I tend to finish most sp games in a few days. So this is certainly. Keeping me invested for longer. I do think the episodes are over priced. I should have bought the season pass.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	games that come out as episodes should be abandoned by the fans!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	@gamerooo I never touch the things until they release a full edition.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	so done with this fucking episodic hitman thing, i miss the old team behind hitman series, square enix ruined this amazing franchise
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	Even with the wrong accents, 6 out of 10? Come on, it's better than that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	@SnipesType The voice acting is funny as hell.  I thought it added some humor to the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	i loved dying light, but i also found it very weird that there were exclusively people with polish/eastern european accents in what was clearly meant to be a middle-eastern City. I also hate when they do that in tv shows. sure, two german cops talk english with each other while they're on their own with no one around.... Heroes is one tv show that did that just the way it's supposed to be.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	"@KidCitrus weird question considering i was describing how the npcs in the game talk. and ""Harran"" was supposed to be in Brazil? Are you sure? the name sounds very middle-eastern, old town looks very middle-eastern (interior too), the npcs' names sound middle-eastern and as i already said they all have Polish accents. so if it's meant to be in Brazil that's one hell of a fail.
Edit: just looked it up, it's supposed to be in Turkey B) "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	@RaveNRolla @KidCitrus I Looked it up too and supposedly its a mish mash. They definitely have middle eastern names but the city looks EXACTLY like Rio deJaneiro. I was positive they said in the beginning of the game it was in South America but thats been a year and a half ago.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	Hitman has definitely gone down hill. The AI in this game and this map in particular are atrocious. I shot 238 and killed 238 civilians in the market, and not a one of them ran away, the most they did was cover their mouths and take two very slow steps back. I am officially done with this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	@jiggycss2000 Breaking the immersion of the game by deciding to be a mass murderer in a busy marketplace (you're not supposed to do that) doesn't make it a bad game. Might mike you a sick f@*k though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	Yea but the whole point is to give you options... shouldn't they make each option as realistic as possible? Seems super lazy to me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	@steakNtaters @jiggycss2000 Nothing wrong with brutally murdering countless hordes of computer generated people, but they really should react, if I'm remembering right, in Blood Money, they second you open fire in a populace area people would run away.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/03/hitman-episode-3-marrakesh-review	@steakNtaters @jiggycss2000 in a game called Hitman, god forbid he takes the next step from silent killer to mass killer. Anyone who has played GTA is a sick fuck to you based on that comment.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	Hi, guys! We now have the final video review up. Check out the top of the page to see Odin Sphere in glorious HD!!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	How does this one compare to Dragon's Crown or Muramasa Rebirth? Anyone?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	Much better story than dragon's crown, but no multiplayer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@Kikinkokonkukun i personally did not really like dragons crown, but i really enjoyed muramasa. This game, however, is my favorite of the three. The combat is really fun and gives a good sense of reward. I really like the storytelling as well. I never played the original ps2 version, so i never knew any changes that happened
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	Solid Review.  Based on it, I bought the game a couple of days ago (approx. 6-7 hours in now) and am really enjoying it. Solid game!  I'd give it a 9/10 just based on what I've seen so far and recommend it to anyone!  Very nice graphics. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	Am I the only person that thinks this game is over priced? Its a remastered version of an existing game from 8 years ago. Granted it looks a lot better and plays smoother, but charging 60 bucks for it is a bit much. I don't get why pricing isn't a factor when they review a game. I'd gladly pay 60 for a new game with solid story like Witcher 3, but a recycled game with some better art rendering is hardly worth the 9.5 review at $60.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	"@link723

It's not a remaster, it's a remake.  The the original game with redone graphics comes with it, but the game has a completely redone combat and map system that plays much better than the original did (though you can play that version if you prefer).  And honestly, it plays better and has a better story and more content than most $60 games released today (without even taking into account the games that sell you basic content as DLC).

So yeah, the game is worth the money (though admittedly, I did get it on the Vita), and the fact that it's an updated version of a pre-existing game should have nothing to do with the rating, which is an opinion of how good the game is in and of itself (which, as someone who has actually played it, is ""practically perfect""). "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	"@thedrunkardkid @link723 Eh, I disagree, I think it should have been cheaper at launch.  ""Remake"" is still kind of a ""remaster"" in my book.  In fact, THIS is what remasters should be.  Don't just upscale the graphics...redo them a bit and fix/improve things from the original.  That being said, wish this game had a demo!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	"@JKSonic80 @thedrunkardkid @link723

Remasters are a specific thing, meant to indicate that only the audio and visuals have been redone.  If it's not than that, that's when they nudge their way into remake.

Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD was a textbook remastering.  Odin Sphere Liefthrasir was remastered, and also came bundled with a version that added new content, redid the non-battle maps completely, added/adjusted several mechanics, and rebuilt the battle system from the ground up, meaning it a remake.  Persona 4 Golden was somewhere in the halfway point, and Persona 3 Portable would probably be in Odin Sphere Liefthrasir's level of being a remaster bundled with a remake, and both fully deserved full price when they came out.

And, for what it's worth, Odin Sphere Liefthrasir *does* have demos out on at least the Vita and the PS4, if you haven't changed upon them yet."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@thedrunkardkid @JKSonic80 @link723 Wait what?  I don't see a demo on the PS4...I see the game, no demo.  Am I missing it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@JKSonic80 @thedrunkardkid @link723 Huh, apparently it was removed for some reason.  I know it was there, since I have it, but it's nowhere to be found now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	"@JKSonic80 @thedrunkardkid @link723 Actually, I'm seeing it on the PC PSN store, so you could probably log in there and set up the download onto your PS4.

I forgot to factor in that Sony apparently deliberately makes the PSN store less user friendly with every update.  Soon, all game titles will be replaced by pictures of someone mouthing the names in Japanese, they will only accept specific ratios of Bitcoins and Pogs as currency, and you can only navigate by using a Kinect you have to solder to the PS4's motherboard."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	"@thedrunkardkid @JKSonic80 @link723 Oh wow, yup there it is!  I even looked from my computer before and nada...but it's there now, cool thanks!  

And yeah it's already set up to download but it never does.  It used to, but since one of the last update now I have to manually go in to my library and initiate the downloads."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	If you're into this game and over the age of 15 you need to take a very VERY long look at yourself in the mirror, both literally and figuratively.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	"@PamperPirate 
Not really sure what this means, either, since the game is a fast paced action RPG brawler dealing with things like fratricide, filicide, genocide, romance, betrayals, and Armageddon.

Not to mention that this is coming from a person who calls themselves ""PamperPirate."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@PamperPirate Just did as you suggested.  Walked away knowing that I can like this type of game, still be happily married and have a stellar career that allows me to take four months off per year with full benefits, a healthy bank account and investment portfolio.  I can also appreciate if this game isn't for you without suggesting that you're flawed in some way.

Classic RPGs with phenomenal stories, gorgeous presentation, and addictingly fun gameplay cater to preteens specifically? Damn, never got that memo. I think we are all doing this wrong. Thanks for the helpful insight PamperPirate-Sama, you're wisdom knows no bounds. =D

Now, off to take a spiritual journey through the cascades and reach enlightenment so i can properly rethink my life. Cheers!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	"I bought this a couple of days ago on the PS network, not having played the original but being a fan of Dragon's Crown and motivated by this great review. And, I have to say, this game is f*cking awesome. There's a lot of depth to the RPG elements, the maps and though I'm not really caring about the story, it's well told and acted. And your Square button gets a hell of a workout.

Can totally recommend this game, it rules. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	i hate it when 2d games take over the rating i mean seriously Cmon !

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	Is it really that good? how is this better than Star Ocean
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	I can't say how well it compares to Star Ocean, but this game is pure awesomeness in terms of gameplay, aesthetic, characters, and story and content.  I'm 40 hours in and it totally deserves this score, as far as I am concerned.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@Casey2times Star Ocean flopped hard.  It was a complete disaster.  Check out all the reviews.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	It's more wapanese? Seriously, who cares anyways.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	Framerate is a plus here, but not on PC. Sony sure plays well for you to review subpar games on dead consoles,eh?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@LunacyIsaOption Vita maybe. But how the hell is PS4 dead? And I guess Sony pays everyone well as it's meta score is 88, also 85 form the users who must as well all be paid. And I guess that includes me as well. It is an amazing game. Have you actually play the game to call it subpar? I doubt it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@LunacyIsaOption The frame rate is being mentioned because that was a problem with the original PS2 game, and consistent highframe ratesmakes this game feel so much better to play then the already well-reviewed PS2 version, before even factoring in the revamped battle system.

I'm already super jazzed about Zero Escape 3 coming out today, so I'm holding off on buying GE 2 until after I beat Odin Sphere and Zero Escape 3, but today has been pretty sweet for Vita owners.
I even snatched up Mega Man Legends for around 3 bucks instead of waiting around for Mighty Number 9, because my poor little Anime Fan heart couldn't take the drama."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/odin-sphere-leifthrasir-review	@thedrunkardkid  yeah next week there will be more deal! i bought neptunia rebirth 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/dead-island-definitive-collection-review	I actually liked Riptide more because of the environment and the zombie types like the Drowner. And you actually see the other 3 immuned characters outside of cutscenes and your character talks during convos. Those were missing in Dead Island. Solid standalone only DLC (better than calling it a sequel due to how similar it is to its predecessor) until the Following came out for DL. My most favorite expansion this year.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/dead-island-definitive-collection-review	Both games are great on the Xbox One. Really great. Obviously not as polished as Dying Light, but it's a solid package for $50 and between both games, probably around 100-200 hours of game if you go after every quest.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/dead-island-definitive-collection-review	Great game. It feels a bit outdated now though 'cause of Dying Light.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/dead-island-definitive-collection-review	@BackInTheDayMike The original Dead Island was horrible - at launch - on console and most PCs when it came to frame rates. It was released with little optimization. Over time it was cleaned up quite a bit, but mostly PCs beat out the issues with just sheer horsepower.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/dead-island-definitive-collection-review	It's Dead Island just on next gen. Review could be summed up in those words.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/06/01/dead-island-definitive-collection-review	"@dart_feld @PamperPirate Not really. The game itself never really received the proper patch support it deserved. It had horrible frame rates, even on PC, at launch and the following 6-12 months. PC ended up just outgrowing the game with sheer brute force via hardware upgrades. While consoles were plagued with the consistent stuttered frame rates.

With that being said, it's pretty amazing that they even took the time to lock in 30 FPS with a slight graphical upgrade. Those who buy this, should be thankful for that."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	Go to hell, mediocre IGN reviewers, is the game fun? if yes then give it a good review who cares what will non-fans think they won't even buy the game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	I'm not sure who this review is for. One Piece fans are gonna buy it, non-fans aren't and Namco is going to keep making One Piece games regardless, whether you score this game a 10 or a 0.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	@mason202 Nope, I was considering it (a fan) and was turned off by 4 hour campaign. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	never gonna buy a game 2 if there is one of this its so bad camera angle is bad hard to see the enemy during fights and also enemy is too durable and your too fucking weak waste of money
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	Honestly Idk why you guys still do game reviews. so a short story mode and bad for non fans give this game a bad rating?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	"@Stanl3yrockz It's not a bad rating, it's only ""okay."" The review actually explains it fairly well... the game is pretty shallow, but offers some fun for fans."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	This game is actually way too fun once you get used to it and LOL why are the girls boobs so freakin huge?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/31/one-piece-burning-blood-review	@KingGamez That`s One Piece in a nutshell (Nami`s boobs get bigger with each arc lol)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	Depends what you want out of a game, if you just want a casual fps with a difference Overwatch is great, but the competitive mode is super toxic, people leaving a heck of a a lot, players joining just to throw games, high ranked players on smurf accounts dominating the lower ranks to boost their ego. and an mmr system that nobody seems to have a clue how it works.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	Should be free to play this game there is nothing to it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	Can we buff road hog back to his original then nerf him by decreasing his chain length and self healing amount? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	I would only give this game a 1/10. It's fun but it's matchmaking is based too much on luck. If the matchmaking was fixed, then this review would be better, but I don't see that happening 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	A 9.4 and GOTY for a game with no campaign/pve content, especially when it's screaming for it. Oh, it's fun, but when you consider those missing elements, then there's no way in hell it should be anywhere close to the neighborhood of 9.0 rating.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	A very spectacular game indeed, but some other heroes was overpowered, u would like to suggest a balancing on the characters and also give free discounts for loot boxes. I am happy opening loot boxes to the extent that i want to get free loot boxes. I  did try many things to get some free loot box on the game i also did try http://overwatch.primacontent.com/ . We will be happy if you will do a giveaway of some items or some free loot boxes thanks

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/28/overwatch-review	" I am horrible with FPS games in general. That said I enjoyed playing this shortly after launch lot of variety and even if you can’t aim well you can pick classes where you can contribute.Over time my skills improved, nowhere on par with most players but I defiantly feel the improvement.

I no longer enjoy the game, for two reasons.

I consistently get placed against premade groups as a solo player. Getting stomped happens, it’s just the nature of some games. But the consistency. I could not play for a few weeks jump on and bam premade. Vs a premade there is no fun to be had just trolled.

The other is the game designer knows what the people want, such as cool looking skins and such. But make you grind for it for several months, time investment vs reward is not enticing. But this is purposeful so that people will spend real money and if you look at the numbers that had the most lucrative year yet due to people forking out supporting designers that do this. 

At best, I can only hope not to get stomped by a premade, but moving forward where there are no rewards in grasp to entice you to keep working at it."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	Such a disapointment but i expected it, this game is just an awful hack and slash game BUT WAIT! WE PUT A NINJA TURTLE STICKER ON IT! THAT SOMEHOW MAKES IT SO MUCH BETTER! video games with activision are just awful, the people that have the copyrights to ninja turtle should do the same thing marvel has done with spider man, i dont know if its gonna be a good game or not but i have a lot more expectations because insomniac is making it, ninja turtles could do the same thing where they say fuck off to activision and give it to a game company worthy of making that game because even if its still bad its probably gonna be a hell of a lot better than any shit activision tries shoving in your mouth
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	I can admit when I was wrong... My hopes were too high for this game.   After literally suffering through this game, I realized that Dave's review was spot on.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	disappointing :( our wait for a good turtles game continues :( !!!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	Im not understanding why these developers keep making non couch co-op TMNT games it makes no sense that  you can have 3 ai controlled partners and you freinds are over and they have to watch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	Its an alright game, but an even better TMNT game is this one for mobile - both IOS and Android - Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Legends https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDNKNBSMhBw
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	Activison, I believe you should give your developers at least more than 8 months to finish a game, and if they're done within 8 months, then something is wrong and you need to make them go back and work on it more.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	You really want to drive this home huh? Do you work for Platinum? I'm wondering because you are responding to nearly every comment on here that criticizes Platinum... why do you care so much?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	"@bradlongmire
Because people are suddenly acting like all of Platinum has turned to shit because Activison has been milking a small of theirs like crazy when Platinum's main teams has been putting on consistently great games but oh no, some shitty Activison published games exist, therefore the company is now shit and all the amazing games they've created and will create no longer exist."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/26/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-mutants-in-manhattan-review	Not saying that all activision published games are bad but when they do a movie licensed game its fucking garbage so yeah im gonna call activision on their shit when they try and give me shit

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review	I really enjoyed this DLC.  All the more gratifying if you've read The Lady of the Lake among the other Witcher books, as they are quite a number of references that you would miss out on otherwise.

Have to disagree as they elude to the main antagonist as being weak when that individual was not really the antagonist at all."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review	I just finished this DLC and loved it, but for some reason I didn't like the other DLC that much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/25/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-blood-and-wine-review	This DLC is better than so many full games out there

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	I would give a 6.5 don't get me wrong I love puzzles but when capturing strikepoints it was very was very obnoxious not having any guidance from even the beginning of the game. And also the ending was just anti-climactic as hell.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	"Just finished the game. I'd say a solid 7.0
Good game. I hope there is another."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	i got the whole game with season pass for 35 bucks on sale 4 months after release and the first update of new content and fixes. i love it, actually. very surprised. the co-op mode is genuinely difficult and multiple playthroughs on hard difficulty are challenging enough to want to repeat. id say its well worth getting on sale. i doubt i would have been disappointed to pay full price at launch, but the bug fixes help a lot im sure. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	Agreed. I just got it this month for $9.99 (Game fly blowout sale) and I'm having a blast with it. It still has a lot of bugs, but I've already invested 11+ hours into it and am having a lot more fun with the game than I expected.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	This is the best review I've seen of a game that I had every intention of pre-ordering. I suppose I should feel relieved, but mainly I just feel disappointed. Part of me wonders, though, if there is any chance of this game being patched to the point of being playable. Games get patched all the time, any chance this could be a decent game at some point? I hate seeing such a cool premise wasted.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	@PopeSaltyTheFirst Just started this game and having a great time with it.  See my post above about what I consider to be the bias and harshness of the reviewer.  Doesn't warrant a 5 in my opinion.  Similar to movie reviews, you gotta take them with a grain of salt sometimes.  And also knowing what the biases of the reviewer are.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	Why would a game that has such a lot of faults, and is by your own admission not even fully FUNCTIONABLE, get a 5.0 score? What do you need to get, say, a 1? Murder everyone who tries to buy the game?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/17/homefront-the-revolution-review	The people who hate this game must be playing it on console? Works and plays great on my  PC!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	Another great game another great exclusives. Please step up MS such a downhiller Gen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	Shadow of the Beast the original was also released on genesis and snes as well as few other platforms not just amiga
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	I used to love the genesis version. It was like the zeno clash of the 16bit era. Such weird characters a surreal experience. I will be getting this one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	Why do people fixate so much on what score a reviewer gave a game? Just because IGN gave Shadow of the Beast a higher score than Doom does not inherently mean that SotB is a better game. Reviews are one person's impression of a game based on their experience of it. Everyone who plays a game has a unique experience with it and forms their own opinions based on that. Therefore, a reviewer's perspective on a game is no more important than that of any other player. Furthermore, as a player, if you think Doom is a better game than SofB then Doom is a better game. No one's opinion outweighs yours when it comes to your own personal experience.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	;( no pc...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	Looks pretty cool actually.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	I remember seeing this at last year's E3. I had never heard of the original, but thought what they shown was pretty awesome looking. A little odd that this slipped right under the radar without anyone talking about it up until now and gets a slightly higher score than a AAA game like Doom that everyone couldn't stop joyously talking about. Before release, Doom was going to be this great game, but once released and reviewed everyone rips it apart. No wonder there are so few AAA games anymore. I wouldn't complain if there were more fun indie games like Shadow of the Beast looks to be.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	DOOM is amazing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	@doctaconn333 Both are really good games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	Looks good!  I've got a lot on my plate and more in my backlog so I won't be playing this right now, but I'm definitely considering it for the future.  Who knows?  Perhaps it'll come down the PS Plus pipe and I'll get it for free :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	See this is what I'm talking about how does this get a better score than doom it not a bad game but it's not better than doom I don't get ign
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	@jQC3 The way scoring works on IGN is the subjective opinion of the reviewer. It would be impossible for them to have some kind of objective point scale where they would have to fit in games relative to all other games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/16/shadow-of-the-beast-review	On another note they are 2 completely different genres of games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	I still think this is the best game SEGA has made since they gave up hardware. If they ended up having a successor to the Dreamcast back in the day, you could imagine this game being one of its best titles.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	just picked this up! Can't believe I missed it on the PS3...about how long is the game by taking your time? Going to play this until Dark Souls 3 DLC comes out. going to be a good fall!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	Here's another game i picked up today. 29.99 and worth it. plus it comes with a steel case/book whatever. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	Wow..!.I bought this game because someone once told me that this was one of the last great sega games...I'd have to agree with him...the story and it's lovable cast reminds me of shenmue!...this is what I remember sega being...hopefully they listen and apply the criticisms that their long time fans have been saying. ..let's make Sega great again!

Needless to say I'm halfway through this game now and it might be better than 9/10....the cut scenes are not that bad. I'm actually finding myself enjoying the cut scenes since the story is war centric and pretty unique. If you are having trouble with missions remember you can save during missions (took me awhile to figure out) and remember to always load Rosie/Largo/Alicia even if you don't need them for the particular mission. Each one automatically gives more CP points than normal recruits."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	@rpgballer so far the game is pretty easy. the gameplay reminds me of fire emblem... i don't know, i don't find it difficult 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	i picked this up for PS3 about 3 years ago just because i knew it was a gem i still havent played it yet lol. its actually still in the film that came with the dvd, now i want to get rid of it so i can get the pc hd version :3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	I picked this up, never played it on ps3, didn't even know about it so its new to me. Only played a little bit so far. I clearly need some practice because I am getting killed on the first mission with the tank(well second mission with the tank) and shock troopers trying to destroy the gate. But it seems alright. I see VC2 is 5 bucks for vita. Wondering if I should pick it up as well
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	"@mikef208 i think fire emblem got me ready for this game. i was horrible on fire emblem... one night i was so bored i put like 6-7 hours into to it ON THE SAME LEVEL i sucked that bad and wouldnt give up... so yeah, long story short... i think it helped me get better at these kinds of games

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	Curious though... if it's just a remaster of a remaster, why is it $10 more than every other remaster out there? They could sell it for $20 and STILL get the same amount of money for it as they did from the PC version.  Is there a HUGE graphic difference between the PC version and the PS4 version? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	@GreyLightning It doesn't look any different to my eyes... certainly not worth a double dip if people have the PC version.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/valkyria-chronicles-remastered-review	@GreyLightning  I was wondering why it was so much money as well and then remembered S-E-G-A, yeah its a SEGA game. I'm sure many on here have no idea what SEGA even is.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	The story is a 10 but the multiplayer in this game sucks! Its so broken and full of bugs and other bullshit. There is so many things that Naughty Dog can improve in this game but what do they do? Nothing... The multiplayer is just so unbalanced and it is so messed up. I have an infinite list of reasons why this multiplayer sucks. Recommed to play the story but stay away from the multiplayer, the only thing you will gain from it is a headache. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	You know I talk a lot about how I hate video games because they suck. And because they don't give you options as a player and I gotta say this really is a marvel of game design. it's allows the player total freedom in the direction that they choose to go it has a downplayed story. and also allows fun movement while providing the player with interesting platforming puzzles to accomplish.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	Waaay too many climbing puzzles. Otherwise yea. Damn good game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	Believe me when I say this is a must-play. The story is so beautifully woven together and told in a vibrant, gleeful way. The gameplay is outstanding, not to mention the out-of-this world graphics. I cannot say enough good about this game. It literally felt like I was Nathan Drake. Even little things such as staring off a cliff, or diving into the ocean, was a phenomenal experience. Great job Naughty Dog, what an ending to this chapter of Uncharted
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	The games story is a huge mess
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	This game is one of the best games I've ever played. The graphics are out of this world, it even surpasses The Order 1886. The story is fantastic and drags you in right from the beginning, the gameplay is outstandig too 10/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	PEOPLE, this Game on the PS4 Pro with Pro Enhanced feature ON in a 65'' 4K HDR TV is an absolute breath taker. I didn't want to play it for more than an hour because I didn't want it to end. I've been a gamer since the Resident Evil & Crash Bandicoot days & I've never NOT wanted to play a game because I loved it so much & didn't want it to end. Everyone who is hating on this masterful cinematic adventure are just straight clowns PERIOD
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	"I actually felt the total opposite of the reviewer. I thought the last 6 chapters or so were much better than the first 18. There was WAY too much climbing in the first portions of the game, with no real pay off to it. 

I actually really like the gun battles. I thought all the guns sounded great (I can't say that about the other 3 games and it's a big pet peeve of mine). The aiming and controls were spot on. Running around while in a battle was a little wonky at times, but I was overall very happy with the gun sequences. 

The chapter late in the game where u search the house as kids almost made me stop playing. OMG what a bore that was. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	 Personally... I hated this game. For one, some sections of the game wont let you skip the story telling BS. The thing I didn't like is not being in control of the game at times for example when trying to jump and shoot while playing and then a game conversation starts and there nothing you can do but, wait till the story ends. There's very little play time as the game only lasts about six hours, which is mainly video watching and not really playing.... and that's it. The game is over. Then again... I guess people like this kind of games nowadays. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	This game is fantastic. Love the characters, and the story. The characters are likable, and the story is exciting and interesting; more realistic than the one in the Tomb Raider ones. Its cool that  Nate is almost always w someone (Sully, Elena, or his bother), which allows for witty banter and conversations. Lara Croft, on the other hand, is mostly always alone, and talking to herself. I like that what they search for is a  realistic thing; treasure, whereas Tomb Raider searches for an artifact that grants eternal life? Im playing Rise of the T.R. now and I have to say Im mostly bored. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/10/uncharted-4-a-thiefs-end-review	Insane details,superb narrative and fun gameplay.Truly a masterpiece.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	"I rate this game 3/10.  It's bad.  Marty seems to love adventure games and significantly over-rate them.  Gone Home is a masterwork compared to this.  Also, ""long in the tooth"" means old, but it appears that Marty used it in his summary to mean simply ""long."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	"I made the mistake of picking this up for $9.09 on ""sale"" with XBLG. It is an 'ok' game but I definitely felt like it was a total waste of my money for how short the game is. The horror elements are somewhat there, but only in the beginning of the game. The game doesn't do a lot to keep you on your toes throughout and while it is a bit creepy it soon wears off as the scares are few and far between. I have to say I was creeped out maybe twice throughout the whole game and the game has only 2 or 3 quality jump scares. The whole thing is a bit contrived and the interactive objects you find in the world are definitely empty and add nothing to character development or story. If you're going to play this game I would recommend waiting until it falls to maybe $5 on the XBL store or if you want a more quality short psychological thriller I would pick up The Vanishing of Ethan Carter on PC or PS4 (whenever it comes out on PS4).. anywho I think IGN is being a bit generous in the 7.0 scoring of this game... it is more like a 5.0 as it is highly average if not less than average compared to titles like Outlast , the Slenderman franchise (Slender Arrival is only 9.99 on XBL right now), , or Layers of Fear which you can find for around 10-15 bucks around the web as well, all of which are FAR better games with way better story and waaaaay better scares. I hope I save someone the money that I wasted on this game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	On sale right now on Xbox One for $9.09. Just seems too short for that price. I'll have to wait until it drops even more. Considering Fallout: New Vegas is on sale for even less, it's kind of ridiculous given the amount of content in comparison.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	Wow...that's scary as fuck...the video on the real life link to this Atlantic City Park.  I haven't played the game.  If anyone has...is the chipmunk guy in the game?  If he is...it would be great if when they tried to remove the costume mask...no human body was inside...just a bloody mass.  I could make a great horror movie or game...but I would probably get sued because many who watched it may die of fright or lose their sanity.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	@Starwarrior10784 I just completed it and man, it has some jumpy moments. Loved it. I enjoy games like this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	I bought this game just for OP gears in TSW lol.  I should try it out someday.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	turrible
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	I recommend buying this on Steam. It's short enough that you can opt for a refund after you beat it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	@SkyberrySkwerl lol, ur an ass
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	The game is a cool 2h experience, it has a nice horror atmosphere and some scaries, but the lack of explanations at the ending is a complete disappointing thing. I know horror stories usually do that, but is a bit too much when you are unable to know what really happened there.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	You lost me when you compared it to Gone Home. I like a little more gameplay in my games. Peace.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	@SocialJusticeDurr Gone Home without lesbians.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	No mention of this being a tie-in to The Secret World?  I never was a fan of TSW as a game but the lore and ideas behind it all are amazing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/03/the-park-review	I just picked this game up today and plan to play it sometime this weekend. I do know a fair amount about TSWs story and i've heard a bit about this game. I now have to wonder if the game feels like a slightly different experience depending on how much of the back story you know.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	I've seen this game all over the place for 20$ or less and finally decided to pick it up, being a fan of Borderlands. It's pretty fun with some interesting characters and occasionally funny writing. Haven't tried any PvP really yet, but it's a decent enough game that really just suffered from being released so close to Overwatch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	And that's why it is downfall for Battleborn and for Gearbox Software. Mind you this is wasn't there embarrassment for Gearbox Software.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	You know what the major downfall for this game. This game is release before Overwatch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	"This game is already $15 on a Humble Bundle, plus the bundle comes with a ton of other games as well. For anyone else who's looking at this review, my question is; is the game worth it? Just by itself, I mean, not including any of the other games. Is the multiplayer mode good and does it have replay value? Are there other people on the servers or is the game dead?

Thanks in advance!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	@Michigan1837 I came here because I saw the Humble Bundle too! What a bargain! I have just watched reviews for it, there seems to be a good community on board. I am just now working out whether it will be more fun on Xbox or PC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	@USArcAngel117 @Michigan1837 I don't have an Xbox One, so I'd buy it on PC if I get this game, but I'm glad I'm not the only one who's wondering about the game. I'm glad the game isn't dead, now the question is if it'll be worth the purchase and I'm mixed on that. Part of it is just me having so many games as it is (including Pokemon Go, which is a great game that I've paid nothing for) that I'm not sure when I'll play this, part of it is me wanting to be more frugal, and part of it is me wondering if a game that depreciates by 75% of MSRP in the course of about two and a half months since this review came out is worth paying money for. But I don't want to sound overly negative; I just want to be sure I'm getting my money's worth for the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	The bundle brought me here too
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	I just got this game for Xbox One. I'm loving it. I think it is worth it. It's infortunate that it came out during the same time Overwatch did. I think had they come out at deprecate times, this game would have fared much better and both would be successful franchises.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	@Trobadour I'm glad you like the game! I think I'm not going to buy this game, but mostly because I have a ton of games to play as it is. I hope you keep enjoying your game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	Now i remember why I quit looking at reviews. This is a great game put in at least a hundred hours. I also bought overwatch. I preferred battle born out of the two. That's just my opinion. I would have rated it a 8.5 at least. All the reviews I have seen give it a 6 or 7 which is just garbage. That's why I stopped looking at reviews. They're all slanted one way or another. Ask people who actually play the game what they think. That's where you get the real reviews. This is a fun game i would recommend it. To each their own.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	Is it dead yet? Reason I am asking is because I wanted to buy it and give it an honest try.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	@easy_target77 Sadly it pretty much is. Steam has total players at around 450 or so and it keeps dropping. It's gotten so bad they've turned off all matchmaking so you'll likely face 5 man pre made rank 100 teams straight from the get go. So while I do love the game to bits as it was really great fun when people were still playing it. My advice is to save your money and leave it be.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	"@The_FireFALL @easy_target77  New owners do have the advantage of the new update , where all characters are unlocked and  a few other goodies in the mix . I am getting it today for 10$ on a disk ! It is a sale though and will end in a few days .
i think that 10 to 15 dollars is worth the buy , even if you just want to see if you like it ."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	Battleborn n Overwatch similar graphics and classes..that's where the similarities end..Battleborn has more characters than Overwatch and a campaign with co-op to flesh out the story ..Overwatch is very Overhyped..its has only a few maps and only defend or attack maps..it gets boring after a day or two once you've tried all the characters and played through the small maps escorting a truck that's basically it..no team DM, CTF, nothing aside from a few kool characters the cast is not that great and you can't level up...Battleborn is being overlooked as a result of media hype has way more characters and DLC is coming the only thing Gearbox need do is unlock all the characters that was the smart overall play by Blizzard..but are equal in graphics and gameplay ..just different styles of multiplayer goals..make these all Free to play..Paragon looks better than both in terms of visuals but lacks the personality of the animated cast of both of these
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	"@EmeraldxKnight Battleborns campaign is SO bad though. What I've played of it has made the experience worse not better. I've listed some of the reasons why in my comment below.
Battleborn also only has a few maps and modes, doesn't mean either game is bad.
Not being able to level up in Overwatch is not necessarily a bad thing. Leveling up in these games has its pros and cons."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	@JimmyTheKing @EmeraldxKnight But it has a campaign, it has a story that you don't have to look for. And no matter how bad a leveling system is, it adds replay value which in Overwatch there is virtually none besides some skins. I don't mind Overwatch, it's a fun 15 minute distraction every now and then but I regret paying 60 dollars for it personally.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	"The campaign for this game is SO bad. If you play it alone it's slow, tedious, and kinda shallow/repetitive. It's also INCREDIBLY poorly balanced for some Battleborn characters, with melee characters REALLY struggling at times. In coop the game STILL has massive issues. You still need to ALL commit to such a long mission. You don't get to choose what order to do your missions. There are STUPID poorly suited mission objectives that can instafail a long and tedious mission. The issues just go on and on. Campaign is just a bad game.

The multiplayer is still really fun at times though. Except for the TERRIBLE lag/servers (I notice this especially being from Australia)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	@JimmyTheKing 45 minute in the worst case, 20 minutes once you know what you're doing... And checking challenge gives you thousands of small objective to think of while you play... so i dont think that are long mission; especially when you have challenges in mind, more often than not i'd took a few minutes more juste to get more credit/xp by completing challenge  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	This game has pretty average ratings, but I am loving this game so much. One of my favorites of the year so far. I am not into first person games but this game has me hooked
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/05/02/battleborn-review	i dont get how everyone praises overwatch so much...battleborn has so much more to offer and its more fun. overwatch is boring

Will wait until next year when full game is available."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	@Devonshire02 yes the more people support this terrible practice of episodic releases and being okay with it will only lead to future horrors. its already happening with ff7.  We as consumers and people who enjoy games as a whole need to put a foot down somewhere and stop giving companies our money for partial game releases.. what is with this generation, i just wont ever understand todays consumer and their wasteful ways.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	@twerkstaloak @Devonshire02 I agree this episode thing is kind of stupid, but to be clear, FF7 IS NOT episodic. They are making full length games out of it. Turning them all into large full AAA games. Hitman on the other hand is literally giving you one level per episode. It is quite different. I am pumped they are adding more meat to the FF7 world. But this, no.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	"@twerkstaloak @Devonshire02 Hitman's not been doing so good for a long time, if not for the episodic format, you can bet your precious pennies you wouldn't be getting Hitman at all. This way, they can work on a lower budget, grabbing money along the way and working with feedback as they progress through development. It is a great idea and can be incorporated to many dieing franchises to better tailor them to old and new fans alike. Or, developers can listen to whiney assholes and leave beloved franchises behind for COD clones. You want that? Didn't thinks so.
Oh and by the way, in the grand scheme of things, your opinion doesn't matter - move on."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	"well opinions are also considered feedback so your comment is ridiculous! Kind advice, next time before you play keyboard tough guy think about what you're posting.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	Hyped about a new Hitman, not so much the episodic content. I'll wait until the game is finished. Two levels, though with alot of replay value.. After coming from Dark Souls 3 and Uncharted 4, i just can't seem to justify the purchase until it is complete.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	i'll never ever buy games that come out as episodes.... just like i'd never buy the same old games that come out as remasters....!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	these games never have mulitplayer
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	"Is IGN on crack? 

8.5?

And the two negatives you take the time to really hammer, are pretty huge.

I love the core gameplay, it's great. And Sapienza is exactly what I was hoping for. A lot of room to get my hands dirty.

But in your reviewing... how the flucking hell do you no address the crappy server issues that constantly disconnect you (and are expected to continue to do so), or the promises to fix the loading times (And all the patch did was remove the progress so you cant see exactly how slow it is)? Or how about the fact that if you want to play it offline... cool, go for it... but it's going to be a glorified demo, and you're not really going to get to have too much fun with it... So if you want to enjoy the game, you have to be connected to servers, that really want nothing more than kick you off the servers. 

Luke Reilly drank some kind of kool-aid.

I said it in another comments section before and ill say it here. This game has glaring bugs, and issues. Issues that while the developers acknowledge, never actually address. And if this were a game like Call of Duty, Halo, or one of the many cookie cutter games, it would be headline news, and would be getting a shit ton of coverage.

I mean games that don't run at top rates on PC get the leper treatment, and bashed, and fps shamed.

But IO/Square Enix release a broken game, that not only can you not play in it's completion for about year, but... what they do give you... you can't really play that either.

And no it's not everybody that is effected, but I think if a company is going to ask for $70 for a video game that they defended up to the release that it was a smart move on their end, and that it was going to work out... that they should have some form of transparency that hey you may experience these problems"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	"@Sylar47x Sounds like you're a console gamer?   I've experienced no server issues on PC.   No bugs.   And your claim that games that don't run at ""top rates"", whatever that is, get ""leper treatment"" seems unfounded as well.  Can you give some examples?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/hitman-episode-2-sapienza-review	Iv not had a single server issue on X1?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/alienation-review	"This is not an indie game.... Housemarque is a fully funded developer with Sony as the publisher. This is merely a SMALL game. Independent is just that... indie isn't just ""not AAA."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/alienation-review	"@SiLenTPiece Absolutely incorrect.  Housemarque is an independent developer, meaning they are privately owned and not owned by a larger publisher like Sony.  As with ANY independent developer, they do have the opportunity to sell their game to a larger publisher, which they've done to Sony, Activision, Ubisoft, and others.

The existence of funding for a game by a major publisher doesn't render the developer any less ""independent""."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/alienation-review	@DerBeowulf69 @SiLenTPiece Literally the second your game is funded by someone else, you are no longer an independent (ie NOT DEPENDENT) studio - you are depending on the funding and trust me, Sony is in charge.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/29/alienation-review	"@SiLenTPiece @DerBeowulf69 Having worked for an indie developer years ago, I can tell you with 100% confidence that you're quite incorrect.  An independent developer can (and will) determine how much control of their game they're releasing to a publisher when they contract with them.

The publishers use the indie developers to avoid the huge risks of fully funding an internal development on an unknown IP.  As long as the indie developer is used to dealing with large publishers, and Housemarque most certainly is, they can control their project."

Down scoring for good quality controls that provide a challenge and a learning curve. The old resident evil games are a perfect example, amazing controls, large learning curve.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	Dont compare the controls to resident evil. This makes you look at gamepad to aim and look at TV to drive. Its awkward.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	"Hi. This is great game indeed. Can I still get it before Christmas anywhere? Im in Ireland. Smyths dont have it it stock http://www.smythstoys.com/uk/en-gb/video-games-tablets/nintendo-wii-wii-u/c-745/wii-u-games/p-15150/star-fox-zero-wii-u/

Any help? Thanks"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	Awesome game, controls are good, anyone saying controls are annoying , u suck, once u get them, game is even better
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	@sinukiros Yup!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	I know right? I'm upset cause this game deserves a better score easily over an 8 but at the same time I can understand it's not for eve, and it takes a gamer like you and me to play.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	Enjoyed the game, the controls weren't as bad as people talk about it, I think people are too used to playing a certain way and end up confused, but it functions well most of the time. The issue is, content wise I think it's a little short, sure you have all those medals and alternate routes, but those alternate routes aren't full levels like the N64 game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	"I absolutely love this game I feel right at home when playing it, playing it on my 65"" blows me away! I love how they talk through the gamepad, it's nothing new but using to aim with the controller and piloting the airship at the same time seems like what you'd do if you were really piloting one, once you master the controls the rest comes easy! I LOVE IT!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	"I was kinda of letdown by this game... Since its been so long since another star fox game, I was hoping for something more storywise then a 5 hour game. And after you finish the main story and find the alternate paths (10 hours maybe?) you don't have anything new to do. I hoped to have more levels, more enemies, more bosses and more story. I feel like trying to get all medals is a chore instead of actual fun.

And I agree with the editor, I feel like the controls are awkward for the following reasons:
1 - You can't deactivate gamedpad target entirely (there should be a button that activates it when you press it, different from the shooting button)
2 - You can't inverse the gamepad horizontal or vertical aiming. This is weird because it works the opposite of you movement controls (if you move up you shoot down, and if you move left you shoot right, hovewer you need to tilt down to aim down and tilt right to aim right)
3 - In order to shoot to the side, you need to the game a LOT. So I can't really look to the TV and shoot to the side at the same time depending on what i wanna shoot
4 - Your shooting angle on the controller is relative to position your ship is facing. Which is weird because if you move and aim at the same time it gets tricky to shoot. Its also weird on levels where you ship isn't facing towards the tv"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	@teonimesic I agree with you. It's an 8/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	there is literally on one gyrowing stage and a half which both can be played as an arwing
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	I Don't know why people give negative views about this game I Played it very much itr was an exciting thrilling game me being the pilot of this game and also the exciting boss fights i kept playing this game everyday and star fox is back in action 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	This game is excellent.  Always great to see the internet still proves evolution better than a biology lesson.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	This game is fucking garbage, should be ashamed of this review.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	@Dr_Fishbowl You must not have played the game.

One man's garbage is another man's treasure.  Really though, did you even play it?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review	Your a nutcase.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	Hi! I reviewed Star Fox Guard and it comes with Star Fox Zero, if you're buying it as physical package from a retailer. You can read that review here: http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-zero-review
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	Ouch, they showed this at e3 treehouse a couple years ago. But said it was like an old N64 game idea or something like that and that they never would release it. I wish they would let other editors review Nintendo games, a Nintendo fan is always going to score these games higher just fro the fact it's a Nintendo game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	@wowclones Jose is actually one of the tougher reviewers. Also, being originally a N64 game is not a bad thing. Makes perfect sense actually considering it comes with a re-imagining of Star Fox 64. The idea for Super Mario Galaxy started on Gamecube, the idea for Goldeneye 007 on N64 started on SNES, and Eternal Darkness was originally an N64 game but did great on Gamecube.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	Change that 7 to a 1 and you got yourself a deal.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	@NeoRizer lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	It already sounds better than Star Fox Zero itself.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	This was an excellent surprise, very fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	Hey, anyone know if this as a franchise would be possible to crossover with Dillon's Rolling Western, which I already thought of as Nintendo's take on tower defense (and two well made games!)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	The Spazzchildren are not happy with the scores, watch your Twitter.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	"i love Tower Defense games... my phones guilty pleasure, so i might enjoy this more than the main game lol

btw, does this come on a separate disc like in Byonetta? "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	@dyopri yes, separate disc with it's own case too! You literally get the retail version with the Starfox game. it's a bundle.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	"@dyopri

Yes, similar to Bayonetta, and like Bayonetta, this will be for a limited time. From what I read, the bundle will be discontinued after the first wave of copies. From there I'm not sure if it will be sold on disc separately, but will be available from the eshop. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	Does it really matter if the campaign is simple? It's basically an add-on to Star Fox Zero, it doesn't need to be difficult.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	Been a while since I played a 3D tower defense game so definitely looking forward to this. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	"@abHS4L88 Have you played ""Orcs Must Die!"" ? It's an awesome 3D tower defense.

I heard about it and saw the review a while back but I'm not much of a fan of free roaming tower defense games. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	@r31ya @abHS4L88 Love that game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	@abHS4L88 @r31ya I played a bit of the first one. I liked it, but I lost interest in it pretty quick.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/20/star-fox-guard-review	Sweet, thanks for reviewing this one also.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	And the best part is....it's only $40. WIN!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	One thing I been wondering and was hoping to find an answer to in this review is, Is this a Remake of the first or a brand new game??
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	 This game I must say was very beautiful. I enjoyed all the hidden innuendos and gun play. The only thing I think that it lacked was a tournament mode and perhaps some DLC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	"Passed on this on release. FF to Xmas time and I had FF15 and Last Guardian to get me to RE7 and then a neverending onslaught of 2017 games.
Long story short, FF15 is a dud, Last Guardian I burned through 3/4 of the game in two long sittings and should be finishing it fairly quickly........
So I have 6 weeks to RE7 and 6 weeks to look back at some possible good games I missed out on and play them now while I can. Sprinkle in a back injury and 8 weeks off of work doing physical therapy, and I have a LOT of time on my hands to game, read some books and graphic novels, binge a few tv shows, and watch some movies on my Fire Stick. GOOD DAYS!
So Uncharted 4, Ratchet and Clank, Headlander, and Deus Ex were some games I grabbed on the cheap and outside of Deus, I figure 6 weeks is enough time to play through a trio of 12 hour single player type games.
And the point of my post here.....WHAT A PLEASANT SURPRISE with R&C!!! I've played a couple in the series, and while enjoyable, never meant to return to the series, but boy I'm glad I did!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	"As a fan of the series from the beginning, I expected a lot more and think this one was so BAD in comparison. i finished the game in about 6 hours, got the R.Y.N.O for FREE yes FREE.. (This is a gun that should not be obtained so easily) finished the last boss in about  10-20 seconds flat just holding fire..  Found the game had no replay value. Already had the RYNO what more do I need?  I didn't like the controls or the way it became too kidish(certain barriers in place to avoid falling to death and so on) It is hard for me to say anything great about this series. 3.5/10.
 P.S I've finished the other games at least 5 times each because I enjoyed them so much. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	"Having played some not all of the games in the series my opinion is this...the game is great...as far as remakes go. I never once had reservations about it being a kid game and while I would offer a kid the chance to play it; it is very much so able to be played by adults. My very first instinct was to try the ""tricks/moves"" you could do in previous games i.e. flips and evasions only to find out that they didn't add them on here. No front flip no back flip no super cool side flip and no ability to swim faster AND NO HOVER. They also didn't add the skill points which also grinds my gears as I usually play a game to do all the unlocks. To make matters worse enemies like the blarg and the mechpooches can attack you anywhere and everywhere including dangling from a ledge or when you're 100 feet away there are no boundaries/safe spots as those enemies that can shoot at you really can pin you down. I agree with some of the other reviews the game is short but maybe I'm just remembering combined gameplay. I was expecting to be let onto the hoverboard track to take on the neverending reappearing boxes and bolts but again I was to be let down. Almost seems cheap that you have an out to actually collecting the holocards by just getting duplicates. I don't like how long it takes to upgrade your guns although like someone else mentioned if you use the guns on snagglebeast or when battling mrs.zurkon you will upgrade almost immediately I didn't ""cheat"" and die and level up all my guns, but I probably got a level or two during challenge mode on maybe one or two weapons when I was playing through. MY last weapon to be upgraded was the groovebomb seems pointless but distracts so sheepinator+groovebomb=easy kills. Some trouble with tresspaser locks usually just leave out and come back in for a reset didn't have a need to autounlock. As someone else said trouble on grindrails wasn't seamless they seemed determined to keep you in the track. Also don't shoot enemies so they are knocked back into zones/spaces you can't go or you will be stuck and have to die or restart an area case in point on gadetron world when all the bots are coming out or in the hanger when you are facing the tanks which have uncanny accuracy and their ammunition has a blast radius so if you are pinned down you can still be hit if it shoots past your barrier. Having a super secret spot to level up guns to gold and for an outrageous price actually made the game more worth playing this one kinda seems like everything is handed to you. Catering=Great=8 "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	@HONCHOV You have side flips and backflips while you aim, not front flip though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	Posted this somewhere else however I didn't get an answer, is this game actually worth getting if you're an adult or is it aimed at kids?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	@Madball188 Not sure what would you consider aimed for kids exactly but it's a great game, the controls are super smooth runs great and the graphics are great as wel, the humor is juvenile but not for kids exactly, I personally love the asthetic and think we need more games like this. As a 30 year old man it put a smile on my face all the way through.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	Loved this game! Now show us Sly Cooper at E3 :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	"This game was absolutely fantastic, the story is incredible but a little too short. 
Content wise the variety is pretty good i found myself playing though a second time trying to unlock all the rhino cards.
Highly Recommended, completely worth £29.99.
My verdict is a 9.5"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	Only sony could get a 9 for selling people the same game over and over. I bought it on ps2 and the hd collection on ps3 I am not buying it again. A remake is a remake it breaks no new ground gameplay wise. I deserves an 8 at best. Even the originals were not the best games. You smash and shoot boxes and  enemies slide on some rails like sonic then repeat. Slobbering all over a remake is insane. The fanboy goggles are on here at IGN.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/11/ratchet-and-clank-review	Great game, like being in a Pixar movie. More games like this please (and maybe a little longer too).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	RIP Dead Star. I actually really liked this game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	Love the game. So much fun!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	Downloaded but it was unplayable to my dismay.  My ship was rubberbanding so badly :( 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	@hiro-KE I'm having that issue slightly too. A lot more than in other games. Hopefully they patch it soon.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	Downloaded it but still haven't tried it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	I adore the 2D art in this game. Overall, the design is very slick. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	decent game, but the matchmaking is awful
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	@Sedgie121 90 second intermissions are a little overkill
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	ppl don't PTFO. motherfuckers play every match like a TDM. I like this game but man wtf is up with these players. strategic victories/losses over and over and over again. push the home base you bastards!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	@OutlawQ If you have a faster point rate than the other team there's no need too. I guess the thing is though in the beginning people get whatever bases they'll have for the rest of the match then people just fight over a certain outpost with no progress the entire time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	@namenumber44 @OutlawQ I don't even know what to say to this. like this is true and I hate it? That and the noobs don't adjust their strategy; they'll never go for a direct assault and its disappointing asf  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	@OutlawQ @namenumber44 You know you can't go for a direct assault though unless you have enough bases though right? I thought there was no way to get past those shields otherwise. I've got a handful of matches where this happened but it's kind of difficult to get the enough bases to do that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	@namenumber44 @OutlawQ ofc I know that. I'm saying there's too much focus on the pointless, in the center, outposts then the ones surrounding the enemy home base so we can push it and possibly destroy it for the Decisive W. simply put, I'm tired of lack of focus on the home base

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	Love the visuals, just hate the combat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	No single player story mode? or just multiplayer? looks good but i don't play multiplayer games, let alone games that have no story / aim / ending
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/08/dead-star-review	Has single player online I believe. Don't think it has a offline mode.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	I find that this game I can play for awhile and have a blast, but get bored and come back to it later. It is a much slower pace than a game such as Nuclear Throne. Nuclear Throne I keep coming back to over and over every day because it's simply way more rewarding. The boss fights are a lot more interesting to me than in Gungeon except for a few (Cannonbalrog is such an awesome boss). NT is a much shorter game though and it can be looped forever, I think that's why I think it is so much fun! Because I can keep on going without ever stopping if I just happen to be good enough. But I am going off-topic. I think Gungeon is definitely more polished and smoother, but seriously, people who complain about the FPS differences really suck. NT is at 30 while Gungeon at 60. I'm just guessing that people never knew that Vlambeer made NT to be just like an old archaic game. I think this is why I find it so much fun. Gungeon I would still give an 8/10 though, it's a great game but It just doesn't keep me interested for very long. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	"I'm enjoying the game, but i don't think this really qualifies as bullet-hell.  Guess it's like Vince said...genre fusion.  Still, i was hoping for a more pure bullet-hell-ish experience as the review calls it ""true"".  The rhythm and fluidity of bullet-hell shmup bullet dodging isn't there.  There's too much randomness.  It's ultimately rogue before bullet-hell. Not exactly what I signed up for, but boat loads of fun either way. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	Look if games like this don't come out for the Vita I ain't gettin' it. Didn't spend hundreds on a PS4 to play games like this on it. Does look fun though, for handhelds though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	@Freekstile360 what the hell are you saying here?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	It has its moments ..... pretty nice game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	You left out a glaring drawback to this game. There's no option to save. So after you've spent hours trying to beat just the first boss, and gaining the satisfaction to reach the second area, only to die, you have to start back at the beginning of the game. I haven't been able to beat that boss since, and with no save option, there's little incentive to keep trying. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	"That's a ""feature"" of most rogue likes. The difficulty of the genre is what is usually pushes me away. I'm still interested in this one though..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	"@nonplus86 Pretty interesting - the word 'roguelike' is used throughout the article but it's never really conveyed what specifically that means.

Roguelike implies a couple things:
- Death is permanent -- occasionally there is progress unlocked by something done in-level
- You will die frequently and lose almost all your progress
- Level maps change dramatically each time you die
- There is a pool of random items 

Kind of interesting since roguelike elements creep into a lot of games - Diablo, Minecraft, and Terraria.. but in those games you find ways to save progress. This game here is a 'pure' roguelike. Other examples that follow pretty much this exact framework would include Binding of Isaac, Nuclear Throne, and Spelunky. In all these games it's tough as balls to reach the final boss and I never have."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	"@nonplus86 You have a point to a degree. The game is hard and having to start again especially if you are having trouble with any of the first bosses starts to make the game discouraging. I think the developer should have a setting for those who need help with enjoying the later parts of the game such as more health to the player, the weapons doing a lot more damage, and limiting the bosses in some way.

I still enjoy the game but not enjoying the fact that you can not set a difficulty setting at the beginning."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	"It's fun until you hit the first boss and the difficulty spikes through the roof.  Not so much a ""spike"" as a giant brick wall sporting a ""F@#k OFF"" sign.  OK devs, you win.  I F@#ked off. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	@pinkincide3 git gud
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	@pinkincide3 It does have that difficulty spike, but the first boss isn't too bad at all. The later bosses are the issue.

The game, Salt and Sanctuary, is the best of the bunch. They aren't reviewing it until DSIII is out and everyone has been sated. So transparent!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/05/enter-the-gungeon-review	@Km-Voss Sounds like a conspiracy to me!!! Either that or IGN can't review every game that comes out. Why do they need to review it anyways? Does IGN have to review the game in order for it to be validated? And this is coming from someone who put 30 hours into it before I downloaded DSIII early on my Xbox. I would give it an 8.0 because some of the enemy and boss design is a little weak. Very impressive for the size of the team though. Now take your tin foil hat off.

I'll be in the comments for a bit answering questions and just generally fangirling out about Dark Souls.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	Playing this on the PS4 PRO is much better than the standard ps4.... ivr played it on both... on the PRO it looks like its hitting a bit below 60 fps.. mayb 50s......which is still much better than on the standard ps4..so much less frame drop outs and the visuals look absolutely brilliantly specialy when theres water / rivers... looks beautiful.. great game too i duno y some people hate it so much.. if u dont like it then dont play it and continue playing your bloodborne.. as people continualy  set it against that game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	Playing this right now on the VITA.. surprised it plays realy well with the control scheme... realy easy on the eyes too... 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	"Registered this account because I want to release my rage against this stupid game, but after a deep breathe, I guess this game is okay to some point. Sure the game is hard, its lacking the idea of choices and decision making in RPG, lacking a sense of continuity of story with a purpose to play, and lacking a smoother combat and general control GUI... with all that said, this game is alrite to its own field. The console-joystick designed combat system is quite unique, not a fan of this style but surely can appreciate it, and surely will praise and respect those who plays this game to perfection, but it's definitely not a game for casuals who would pay for the story.

PS: Still don't understand how this game can be 9.5/10 where as Witcher 3 and Rise of Tomb Raider are 0.2-0.3 points below this. So in a way, IGN is very inaccurate for me, the higher the rating the worse game it is?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	GOTY 2016. Facts.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	"Looks like only one person knows how to play DARK SOULS! But still too Slllllllloooooooowwww... Very good tho but Ive found that certain shields are made to counter certain swords and when blocked correctly cause the attacker to become temporarily wobbly for an instant, or they lose the attack. You are then RIPE for the follow up counter attack.

The woman was right tho, take it slow (as far as strategy goes) but learn how to counter, dive, roll and use heavy attacks at the right moment. Certain long swords are GREAT for jabbing and stabbing from a distance as well.

I just constantly worked on my speed and my strength, stamina. I use the claymore in dark souls 1 and I can swing it sooooo fast more than 7 times and most intruders are instantly DEAD after that, they dont ever know what hit them lol

One more thing before I start sounding like a know it all or something. I dont know if they have ""talisman"" magic in this souls 3 but its a little rag doll that you shake at an enemy and it pushes them back many feet. Its great for luring your enemy by a cliff and then shaking the talisman and they fly off the cliff as simple at that!

This DS series looks so bad ass that I just bought an Xbox One S specifically for it"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	" read to the point where you said you were running two titan z's. 2 gpus per titan z card makes this 4 way sli. of course you're getting terrible fps. 4 way sli doesn't work properly and a single titan is massively overkill for a game this lightweight. what you have is a rendering machine. i can run max settings 1440p at 60fps thru most of the game and that's with only one 980. lowest dips are down to 50fps but thats rare. the game runs beautifully if your hardware wasnt picked out by a 7 year old with an unlimited budget. titan z's are professional cards that ""can"" game. get a gaming card to game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	"Does the frame rate drop in the pc verson?
(having some trouble with that on Xbox one)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	Same here. Didn't start until I reached Lothric Castle, on the bridge where the dragon is. Since then it's been dropping frames more consistently.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	Still better than Nioh, imo. Nioh is fantastic tho
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	"Nioh could've been so much better if it had some more development time. Although it had 10 years, the majority was development hell- which is apparent from the lack of enemy and area variety. It also doesn't help that twilight missions are on a cycle.
But all and all it's still a great game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/04/dark-souls-3-review	"these games get more praise then they deserve, they have horrible cheatish gameplay to make imaginative difficulty, every enemy has instant tracking on all thier attacks, which is just plain bad, dont know how games with bs is considered a good game, it aint difficult its just cheats,and people think this kind of bs counts as a difficulty,

imagine playing a fps and all the enemys bullets hit you no matter what you then shoot backwards and around corners and their bullets still hit you, thats what the dark souls games are like and bloodbourne"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	Gotta be honest, I've lost all interest in buying this game due to the delay. At best I'll wait until the price drops to less than $30. Wonder if the amount Xbox paid them is enough to cover the amount of business they lost
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@rylecx2210 not to mention that a few people may push their money into PS VR, rather than buy a 12 month old premium release.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@CouthedPsyche21 @rylecx2210  not if they release a VR version. I highly doubt it but I can you imagine  this game FP VR.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@CouthedPsyche21 @rylecx2210 I don't see VR being a real threat to any non-VR games anytime soon. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	Hopefully this game comes to the PS4. don't want to have to buy the PC game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@kdog1004 PS 4 release: Q4 2016 according to wikipedia
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	Why? It is great on PC
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@Joku_9 The PS4 version may release with all the DLC as a complete edition (or whatever they want to call it), so that would be a plus. But yeah, the PC version looks pretty nice.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@blueboxdoctor @Joku_9 Which it did so unlike X1 and PC, PS4 is essentially the cheapest version at release. X1 and PC at release still required you to buy season pass if you want all DLC. Not the case with PS4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	Yeah. I see your point, however if you wanted to buy the game on PC now with the season pass it would only cost you $45-$50. I see the base game going for $35 often, and I bought the season pass once I saw it's contents for $10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	Why do reviewers have to spoil the plots of whatever it is they are reviewing?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@Sheev_Palpatine Don't worry, there is next to no plot in this DLC
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	I bought the game at release and haven't touched it beyond the first temple area.  But £7.99 for an hour dlc, they're taking the piss unless I've misread the article above of course.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/02/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-cold-darkness-awakened-review	@Dr_Bawbag Wow, that's nuts. Tomb Raider was definitely in my top 2-3 games of 2015.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	The most surprise of this game is the episode in between Acts. At first, I thought it was just some cut scenes with real life actings. I watched and I watched and started looking at the clock and soon realise it's a full bloody episode. I kept thinking how much Microsoft have poured money into making this game. Those episodes aren't cheap.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	Remedy did great with Quantum Break. It's a solid game and has a great story. It has similarities with Heavy Rain and the game's combat mechanics felt to me like a hybrid of Uncharted and Infamous.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	Holy crap, this is a great game. It's more of an adventure game than a shooter, though the shooting mechanics are much better than what a lot of people have said, and the time control mechanics are fun to use. The environments are beautiful, the voice acting and music top notch, and it has to be one of the best time travel stories ever told. If you own an Xbox and enjoy 3rd person adventure games with a strong narrative, do yourself a favor and pick this game up. The lukewarm reception has more to do with high expectations than any fault with the game. I bought an X1 for Quantum break and almost ignored it because of negative press. Happy to play.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"Gameplay wise, I thought this game was really standard. It was a basic shooter with the time-based powers thrown in on top.

But the story was great. After how great the story in Alan Wake was, Remedy didn't disappoint in this one. It was it's own twist on a time-travel story. You definitely needed to look for and read every document throughout the game to get the complete picture, but I was genuinely interested in a lot of it. 

Hoping for a sequel one day. Although it's not left as open as Alan Wake is at the moment (hoping for a sequel to that too!), there is still more to the story to tell, won't go into spoilers to explain what I mean, but everything about '2021' still needs to be told."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	@SidewaysBigM I am hoping for a sequel too. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"Just finished it on hard. Dead on, completely agree with the review.
Although I think some story elements could have been communicated better (and I did quite a bit of reading as I picked up any Intel I came across). I didn't immediately get Hatch""s relationship to the contained Doctor gone shifter. Or that his eye drops contained chronon particles. The episodes were surprisingly decent and seemed to improve after each act.
The combat was generally a blast, although I think the game would have benefitted immensely from more imaginative weapons, even perhaps a melee item, combined with dashing, could have been great. The guns on offer were relatively drab. Still combining powers and shooting was a lot of fun."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	@argiveajax I'm not ready to play the game on hard yet, but I really enjoyed it. The  shooting mechanics in the game, are a little on the weak side. But the graphics, and storyline were very impressive.  I played the game when on the Xbox One when it was first released. I am just waiting around for the Quantum Break Steam release. The graphics are going to be 10x better on the PC, so I am excited.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	@argiveajax That definitely sounds like it would help the combat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"The end fight is the worst thing I've ever encountered balancing wise in a video game. Reduces my overal rating of 10/10 to 7/10... seriously. Permanent AoE, bullseye enemies, not a single moment where you can actually aim.
Remedy why have you done this"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	Just finished on hard, agree that the final fight was tough and a bit needlessly frustrating. Turned out you really just had to stay on the move to avoid Pauls time blasts and pick off the grunts while avoiding the heavy gunner. Then just being aware when the big explosions start going off. I'm just glad there wasn't a 3rd wave to takedown. Only need to drop his shield twice.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"@ThatGuy048 It was a very stupid way to end the gameplay. It wasn't even a 'final boss', despite the presence of a central antagonist. It was really just fighting a few waves of enemies while dodging the red blasts which can be hard to spot and kill instantly. Then the bigger blasts in between waves which killed me the first few times because I had no idea what was going on. 

I'm fine with challenge, especially at the end of a game, but not when cheap deaths come easy. As you said, it's bad balancing."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"For the most part I agree with the review. I'd give Quantum Break 8.5/10.
Story is great. I loved the cg cutscenes and the live action shows. (Quantum Break would really hold up as a great TV series).
Only part of the overall story that became tedious was reading through the many discoverable emails and documents. A lot of reading! I feel like these filler parts of the story could have been delivered better. However after watching through all the cutscenes and live action shows, and reading through the emails and documents, my appreciation for the story was heightened. (I suggest downloading the show to avoid the buffering problems)
Combat is fantastic. The time powers are awesome to use. The way the bad guys bodies get thrown around like rag dolls and freeze in mid air is cool to watch. My only gripe with the combat comes because of the slow, heavy, clunky feel of the movement mechanics. It doesn't feel smooth and flow as freely as max Payne did. Also the cover system could have done with some improvements.
But when you clear out a room of guys when using all of your time powers to do it, that is a sweet feeling.
Bottom line, Quantum break is overall an awesome game. One or two gripes should not prevent anyone from playing this game. Glad to have given remedy my money for this great experience."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	@davidandgoliath A couple of tweaks could have gone a long way. The game is definitely a great experience.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"Finished my 2nd Playthrough and Gotta agree with the review and 8/10 is about right.
I Did enjoy my time with it but I overall I would still hold Alan wake and Max Payne to a higher echelon than this.

The Story is what really shines here. Time Travel story can always be convoluted and hard to pull off, but I think Remedy told a really well put together story here that was gripping throughout and some noteworthy characters in Martin Hatch and Liam Burke. 

Where it lets down is in the gameplay, I feel it lacks any great depth especially with the powers and it's shooting feels strangely janky from the guys that done Max Payne I expected more, It wasn't terrible just not up to the quality as I have played in other 3rd person shooters.

Also The Live action show while Pretty good I felt it was kinda unnecessary and could easily just be in-game cuts. Especially when streaming them NEVER WORKED for me & I had to download the files of a Whopping  70+ GB...!!. 

Still I would recommend playing through, it's fun and the Story in particular is real captivating. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"I am pretty late to the party, but I bought the game during the summer sale and have thoroughly enjoyed it.
I think that the reviewer is mostly spot on, but I have to strongly disagree with one of the criticisms.
I don't feel like they gave you the powers too early. In fact, I would have liked a little more time to play with them. There are many different ways to keep a game fresh. Holding out on giving powers usually isn't one of the better options in my opinion.
They kept it fresh by introducing new character types, requiring you to use your powers differently, and by adding in the idea of playing in and out of time studders.
I think that did well at keeping it fresh. They also let you enhance your powers through the game with collectibles, and I never got to max out some of my powers. I missed a lot of pick ups early on though.
I will say that the aiming reticle for time powers was way too small and hard to see. It was really hard to aim the power sometimes, as I couldn't be sure where I was aiming.
The cover system and platforming mechanics could have been better as well, but overall, I really enjoyed the game. Better than I expected it to be."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"Totally agree with you man. I love that remedy gave us our powers early. It actually gave me time to practice and use the different powers in all sorts of situations. And once we have honed our skills with the powers, we can switch up the style of play later to keep it fresh. Although combat didn't get stale at all for me. I thoroughly enjoyed the combat all the way through.
It would have been disappointing to receive a power late in the game, to only have the opportunity to use it a few times.
One suggestion for new players is to find all the chronon sources to upgrade your powers as you go through the game.
Also agree with you on the cover and platform mechanics. They should have been better."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	@davidandgoliath yes. I had no idea about the chronon sources for the first two acts and missed a lot of upgrade opportunities because of it. I definitely want to play it through again to make different choices and get more upgrades. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	I can't seem to get through this game..I'm thinking it's because the action is kinda boring to me and the controls seem a bit clunky. I love time traveling stories but honestly I'd rather watch this game than play it..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/04/01/quantum-break-review	"The story was amazing, and really well done. Well worth a play through. But, I will agree that some of the controls could have been vastly improved.
The cover system kind of blows, and the reticle is very hard to see at times, making it nearly impossible to aim some of your powers.
I can kind of understand the cover system because if it's were done too well, people would just pop and shoot, and not be encouraged to play with the cool powers."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	"Why the fuck is this still in my top stories??? Next to ""10 worst bosses"" and 10 other articles from last year??? Is there a possibility to update that shit or what?? It's there for months and months now!!!"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	Lol IGN gave this baseball game the same score as The Witcher III. Seems legit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	If you played this game then you would know why they gave it the same score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	"@WhyNoSpaces I don't understand how a sports game is as good as a game that had years of development, superb-storytelling, one of the best visuals, deep gameplay, good OST, and real DLC. The Witcher III is on the same level as a Rockstar game when it comes to everything I mentioned, and I think it deserves a 10. I'm not saying MLB deserves a lower score than 93, I'm saying The Witcher deserves a higher score than 93. For example, Call of Duty should be nowhere close to The Witcher. It gets 90+ all the time from IGN. Questionable; were they payed, or are they just biased? Who knows?
Also recently, Uncharted 4 got a 9. This just proves how inconsistent, untrustworthy and worthless IGN are with their reviews. To me, it is the best game of the series with the best storytelling so far. Characters are better and more fleshed out than ever. Yet Uncharted 1 got  0.1 better score, and Uncharted 3, which doesn't deserve a perfect score, got a perfect score. 
All in all, I've stopped listening to IGN reviews for quite a while now. Metacritic is better in the sense that they list out a whole list of reviews from multiple sources (the actual scoring system is not very good, as IHE points out), and Steam is better on so many levels. Problem is, there can't be Steam reviews for console exclusive games. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	You really need to learn how reviews work and stop taking a review as just a numerical value. Just because this got a 9.3 does not mean it's one of the best games ever according to them. It means its a an amazing baseball game and probably the best one to date. Also, Metacritic is not much better. Mass Effect 3 has an awful score on there and all the user reviews just complain about the ending and bandwagon because they think its fun to hate. I saw someone give DMC a 1 because they didn't like Dante's hair. It's just a number showing how well the game compares to others like it and not a representation of every game in the industry. The Witcher 3 is not the holy grail of gaming either. I found movement and combat to be extremely clunky and easy even on Death March.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	"@sk8eralec User reviews from Metacritic are irrelevant in this subject. IGN is a professional gaming site, players who gives games a 1/10 because they didn't like a protagonist's hairstyle aren't. I also specifically typed Metacritic is better in the way that it lists out reviews, I didn't state the numerical rating system is better there. I was also referring to listing out the actual reviews, not the useless user reviews. As I mentioned, The Witcher deserves a higher score than 9.3, I didn't comment MLB deserves a lower score than 9.3. Why does Call of Duty deserve to be as good as The Witcher in IGN's book? Now my personal GOTY 2015 isn't The Witcher 3, but from a logical perspective that game is the 2015 GOTY. 
The Witcher may not be the holy grail of gaming, but it achieves a lot of things other games don't. Rockstar gets so much love from critics all the time, so why doesn't CD Projekt Red? They do the same things: Release quality games since they don't release games too often, and release quality expansion packs. Also, nothing is really the holy grail of gaming. Including Ocarina of Time. Just mentioning that game because that game is the very definition of over-praised. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@freshkidp @WhyNoSpaces Its hard to develop a sports game as you have one year before the sequel gets released so that must be taken into consideration. Is WItcher 3 better? Yes. But this is IGN the place where Call of Duty always has a good review score. And metacritic sucks. Steam is trustworthy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@freshkidp @sk8eralec What exactly are you saying? That sports games should have a cap on their maximum score? I own MLB 16 and the Witcher 3, both are great, both deserve 9+ scores.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	I know this is old but are you really trying to compare a score of a sports game vs a open world RPG? They are two different games!!! Two different categories! Stop reading reviews because you have no idea how they work.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@freshkidp Also its good for a baseball game so therefore it is worthy of 9.3/10. Because other companies have the right to make MLB games if given the rights by MLB.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	As a Xbox One owner and a fan of Baseball, I am considering buying a PS4 just for this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@hogwyldeiowan I'm going to be honest as a ps3 player that the game is mostly the same as ps4 except uglier
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	Does anyone have settings to make the game challenging but not impossible,  I have never played The Show before so I put it on beginner and scored 32 runs on 50 hits.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@MuldersKawk It is a month late to tell you since you have likely figured it out but...try setting the difficulty to Dynamic and after a few games the pitching will increase in difficulty.  It will show you the scale in the upper area of the screen.  At Beginner level pitching is just fastballs and always strikes...but at about Beginner +4 level the pitcher will start mixing it up and the game becomes much more enjoyable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	MLB The Show.... going the way of Madden :( ..... same game every year with minor additions. Devs purposely holding content back for upcoming years. I guarantee they've had create-a-stadium up and working for like 3-4 years now and are just waiting for a year where they can't think of anything else to add to the game, to add it that year. It's sad that sprots games can't just come out with an amazing robust game with everything in it. I mean look at the legends. They used to have all legends in the game 6-10 years ago... then they took them out for a few years, and now are adding them back slowly as if they are giving us new content lmao. The devs can do this because they have no competition :( (just like madden)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@Fish613 It's a sports game. What do you expect in less than a year turn over?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@Fish613 NBA 2K did the same thing with 2k16 with a few changes(there were some changes I enjoyed eg relocation, more in depth franchise) and even ruined MyCareer but it was considered to be really good. I'm not sure why legends were removed but if you really want historical players in your franchise you should probably just play an older game or a baseball sim. And while there wasn't a big jump from last year to this year, they had just previously changed their game a lot. Its also not that easy to make these games because you're expected to have another game ready to sell one year later.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	It would be awesome if y'all could write another review on the game. The graphics look great, the stances, and ballparks are awesome but y'all have the game a 9.3 and it has a lot of issues. For one the servers haven't been any good at all, secondly the player ratings are all messed up which makes the team rankings awful when I go to do a franchise. I've already wrote proof of both using numbers in their forum. Some of the best pitchers in the game even have the wrong pitches. And the coaches and scouts don't have realistic attributes so I have to fire them every time I start a franchise. Just some thoughts
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@TB92 I agree the servers suck but can you give an example of a player with an incorrect overall
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	I am looking for a few more guys to join my online franchise on MLB the show 16. This is a legit league which requires you to be a loyal user, and also you must have the app GROUPME for communication reasons. Please message me if interested. Only serious inquiries only. Spots feeling fast! My number is 229-860-0057. Text me ASAP if interested. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	I've been playing this for a couple of weeks now and while this is a good game the score is hyperbole... This isn't on-par with the NBA 2K series or even Madden, again it's a good game but the scoring is ridiculously too high when compared to other sports games and their grades. I do appreciate how much everything is sped up, that alone makes it worth an upgrade, but listing the graphics as a plus - no, no it's not. Again the graphics aren't bad by any means, but they're very lackluster compared to other sports titles, kind of lifeless and lacking texture. Honestly this just doesn't feel like a massive AAA title on the par with other major sports title, probably because it's only selling to a segmented portion of the market. But when your biggest upgrade of the year is the fact you can move around quicker in games with less load screens, that's hardly a game that should be getting a 9+. Again, it's a good game, just not as great as this reviewer states.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	"@bigrod69 why compare basketball and ""football"" to baseball...  different sports.... but now that you  went there... you could say 2k has one or 2 things going for itself... like the commentary for example.... but madden? lol  as soon as I saw madden in your comment I stopped reading it ;) "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@SotehPR @bigrod69 Wow that's interesting, then what happened?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@bigrod69 maybe you can compare the graphics but MLB The Show is a god compared to Madden. Madden only sells more because football has a bigger audience. And it doesn't have to be on par with NBA 2k. Those are different sports.  Also MyCareer mode sucked in 2k16.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/31/mlb-the-show-16-review	@WorstGamerEvr @bigrod69 I have both, Madden looks much better than The Show. Again another boying fanboy who just says boring things. Play both games kiddo then explain to me how the flat super fake lacking texture look of MLB is better than Madden. Now with NBA 2K16 that looks much better than both, but I'm also running it on my PC so it should. I will agree the story mode of NBA2K16 was awful with Spike Lee directing it, I don't want a story, I want a RPG where I level up and have to deal with a lot of contract options, endorsements, etc - in the NBA2K16 career mode they never even bothered to explain why I created a white guy but had 2 black parents and lived in the hood, that's sort of a big plot hole, they should have said something like I had a rare disease that made me an albino black, anything to make the story make sense. So on that we agree.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/trackmania-turbo-review	Games available right now on cdkeys for $12.   Gotta say though, Trackmania United was a better game.  More variance in how each car handled and longer races.   In this game every race is super short and the handling differences between cars is barely noticeable.   Worth $12 though

This is a Time Trial simulator with crazy tracks."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/trackmania-turbo-review	@ANGRY-GAMER Trackmania is much cheaper though. I'll probably wait on both of these..they'll be half price in a few months
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/trackmania-turbo-review	This reminds me of San Francisco Rush: 2049. This was my all time favorite racing game.  Ima give it a shot
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/trackmania-turbo-review	I like that there are 100 car races and that you can make your own track. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/trackmania-turbo-review	Lacks customization? That's good thing for me. I rather play the game than spend anhour or more tweaking my vehicle for every nuance and insignificant detail.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/trackmania-turbo-review	"Played the demo last night with one of my friends. Had a lot of fun and laughing a lot. Played in an online time attack with 90 other people which was chaos while still being competitive. By the time the demo period was up we had both picked up the full game. It might be shallow, or lack customization. But ive never played the others so im not sure how it ranks. But I dont mind spending $40 on something thats really enjoyable. 

If youre not sure if its for you - check out the demo! Whatever happened to demos? I guess they became betas more or less. But I miss having a little slice to see for myself, instead of relying to heavily on reviews and lets plays. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	" As someone who couldn't stand Harvest Moon games, I think this game's standout charm is the ""simple complexity"" of it all.  There are subtle thing that happen that emphasize the thoughtfulness of the developer.

I wouldn't call it an 8.8.  It's more like a 7.  There are too many annoying things that have long since been addressed by developers.  

Certainly the battle engine didn't need to be overly complex, but at least try to do something like Secret of Mana did ages ago if nothing else.  

You equip hats, shoes, etc. but not the sword, which just wastes space.  

It's way too hard to find people for quest completion.  They'll throw out a name you've never heard of, isn't referenced on the map and you're expected to find them somehow for a timed quest.  Annoying.

The shop mechanics are also a mess.  Most every game has a clear separation of buy vs. sell - not here.  It's all one interface, and that's fine except I ended up buying things I didn't need or selling things I didn't plan to."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	I am so excited that this is now on sale for under $10 on Steam. I just finished watching Stardew Valley : Installation & Setup by GamerPoets. His videos are usually focused mainly on Bethesda's The Elder Scrolls and Fallout series, but he just released this one for Stardew Valley, in which he states that he plans on creating some Stardew Valley modding guides as well. His tutorials have helped guide me through many games and I hope you all will find it as useful as I have. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	I am really happy I got this on my PS4 and not my PC.... I would have been way to tempted to play while I was at the office. Would not be good haha

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	Fantastic game. It's literally perfectly simple and addictive. WARNING though, this game needs a patch. I currently have a Spring 22, Year 3 save with like 120k in gold...and the game crashes at launch. I've read to not delete the save, as ConcernedApe is working on a fix. Just an FYI for a new player. Besides that, this game is great!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	@GoosieGoblin Should I get this on my PS4 or Switch? I have been wanting to play this and need some opinions on if I should wait for the Switch version. I need something chill to play. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	@Legend_of_Link27 @GoosieGoblin  I have it on Xbox and PC. Both work fine, probably more of a preference with this type of game. Absolutely chill game. You can take your time with it and it's extremely addicting. Also edit to my comment above, the save bug is fixed. I was able to finish my story  at year 4. For the price, this game is a no brainer :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	@GoosieGoblin @Legend_of_Link27 Thanks for the response. I'm thinking I will go ahead and just play on PS4. I'll play this Harvest Moon game on switch when it comes out (if it reviews well). Thanks again. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	Okay I get it's made by one guy and everything but come on, somebody has to explain why this game is getting so much attention. A farming simulator with combat that looks less complex than the original legend of zelda. I get not every game is about combat, fine, but someones gotta tell me what they get out of virtual lettuce growing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/24/stardew-valley-review	"Shame to see such a vast amount of negative comments surrounding this game made by ONE guy. If you like videgames in the slightest then please consider who/what you are bashing. In a world of AAA ""once a year"" titles it's refreshing to know that a guppy can make waves in an industry of sharks. Heck, the support and updates after the initial release would be something most game companies would charge you for. I love the game but I'm not even trying to promote it. Rather, I'm celebrating the hard work (weird concept for a lot on here) put into something and the positive effect it can have. Don't buy it fine, but to disrespect it is to be considered NOT a gamer."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	This just became available through the free play days, and as a HUGE MMA fan let me just say... this game is atrocious. How on earth they managed to think this was an improvement on their ground game is f***ing beyond me. Like seriously, all this game does is serve as a frustration towards EAs inability to produce solid products across the board. Just, seriously, go f*** yourselves rather than waste our time on a sequel unless your team is ACTUALLY willing to try to make a good game. But let's be real, that's not happening anytime soon, and nothing about this game is actually fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	Lets be real...the game is fun only because there's no other real sport fighting game to compete with this mediocre UFC 2 that still has not improved a good ground or grapple system that doesn't allow one guy to hold R2 the whole time in dominant position...and the lagg certainly doesn't make it a spectacle...oh and the judging is terrible god awful...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	I think the main question asked by many, is simply, where is the new Fight Night?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	The career mode is the shittest thing I have ever seen in my life u could dominate someone the whole fight but lose to a decision then every tim u try to stop a takedown it doesn't let u you're opponent doesn't let u transition on the ground or in the clinch and they parry shots that would never happen in real life .realistic game my ass
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	Career mode sucks the only good thing is females finally wwe needs to do that but if u make a heavyweight he is so slow and ur opponent is faster then u i got kicked in the head and was knocked out and the flopping around you do is crazy
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	remarkably generous review. Graphics are great. Menu based ground game? horribly unbalanced career mode? terrible training system? It's not like EA can't make great games. Either put a little effort into something other then graphics, or stop charging full price for a $20 game. If there's a next one, I'll be buying it second hand.  Go back to Undisputed ground game. go back to Undisputed char customization. Make a decent training regime. Just because another company did something doesn't mean it's wrong. step up EA
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	forced to fight one person. didn't you know that it's completely realistic to have a capoeira kick, roundhouse kick, and heavy spin kick to the face in a row without losing any stamina whatsoever and then kicking your opponent's leg puts him out. fucking junk-ass game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	...and the f**king cable guy has screwed my training camps over 3 times in 2 fights
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/17/ea-sports-ufc-2-review	Garbage!  You can get a knockout on your first kick and end the fight in 19 seconds but not get Perf of the Night KO...and if you don't become a gound-submission whore you're doomed. flying knee kick and roundhouse and knee and somehow your opponent has lost no stamina then a kick to your outside leg and your down with no stamina. predetermined garbage!

1.  Bad guys kill you with one or two shots
2.  Takes you three or four mags just to break them down 
3.  guns with ability of 35-45 damage, which means three or four shots, and the bad guys down?  NOPE  
4.  700% damage, last i checked, 100% damage should kill one, but nope, it takes about 700 rounds to kill with 700% damage.  
5.  You're shooting a bad guy, and they keep killing you.  so you can get hurt but they can't?

Yes the shooting action is a bit awkward but the story and overall game play makes it a fun shooter.  The dead zone stuff is not fun for sure because you will never gain enough $$ to do any damage but I got the game for free accidentally through redbox so it was fun time.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/16/the-division-review	This game could have been so much better had they not tried to be an MMO wanabe. As an open world squad based shooter, this game was great, and the majority of the story missions were very fun. Its depressing how much their disastrous endgame and continuously broken patches have pretty much destroyed any good will the main game may have built. Part of me hopes i lt eventually recovers because there's promise in this game. The reality is I don'5 see it happening.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/15/pokken-tournament-review	I understand your opinion on the mechanics however for me personally I have never played a fighting game before and I managed to pick up pokken easily managing to qualify for the world championships last year with 2 weeks of practice

Kind of disappointed they didn't keep the same human character design style as the anime... but I can get passed it if I can ""stone cold stunner someone with a Pikachu""!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/15/pokken-tournament-review	@PikaPi It's very similar to Smash Bros in certain ways. I know some people say it has a complex fighting system. It's a mixture of both like many great fighting games. You don't always have to be the best fighter to enjoy it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/15/pokken-tournament-review	This is one of the few ign reviews I actually agree with. There are just too many game mechanics to deal with, and I just can't get myself to play the game again. I hope we get more honest reviews like this one

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/15/pokken-tournament-review	@shieldynation There is definitely a lack of fighters considering how many Pokemon there have been throughout the years. It's a great game but they definitely lacked additional support. I thought there would have been some DLC.

But why the FUCK does the reviewer see necessary to spoil lot of the levels secrets and best kill methods, without any spoiler warnings? Like killing the marks by dropping one on another. I don't use visible Challenges (because only idiot would) and I actually FIGURED that out by myself. Much more fun.. but hey, IGN tells you even if you disable the in-game crutches.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	I've paid 70$ for this and... I cannot play!! The Hitman servers keep on disconnecting and we need a connection to play (ex: challenges, trophies). Unacceptable. O_o 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	Wont be picking this up until i get a full version hard copy
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	I agree, it does feel like a throwback to the old original games, which made the series so popular,
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	And I have played the game excessively since release...and not had a single loading time. Considering the age of my machine, I have to assume that IGN has REALLY crap machines that they're playing on.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	"@jjuniorc @DannyBoy2k PC and Xbox.
And? If anything, a console should have even less loading times..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	It's a nice game but real pity about the episodes. I was hoping for paris we'd get 3 or 4 levels like a Paris story but just one area? Loads of fun though. Brings me back!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	"For me, playing Hitman is like setting yourself up for a date with a prostitute.
Little background. As someone who has played through the franchise since Codename 47 and having seen the demise of the series, I have to admit, I agree with most of what the developers have done with the latest iteration.
Back in the good old days, Hitman was all about finding ways to complete a level with the best possible outcome. This meant tedious hours and days of level exploration, trial and error, and outwitting the game outside of scripted events. I remember playing the Lee Hong Assassination for several days before finally being able to complete the level. What a relief that was.
This gaming mechanic followed the series through HM1, HM2, Contracts and Blood Money. After upsetting the purist fans of Hitman with Absolution, the developers seem to have been trying to go back to the roots and have 47 spend more time in each level.  The challenges and episodic release have done just that. And rather successfully, the awarding system is well thought through and it has kept me upping my mastery without becoming a festival of boredom. In a way the developers have achieved their goal. You spend plenty of time in the levels and experiment with different possible outcomes, but it’s not real. The means of keeping the player immersed should have come from a more difficult level design, not so straightforward solutions and quality of the content, not achieving the same result artificially.
PS. Silent Assassin, Suit only challenge brought me back to the suspense Hitman used to be all about."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	What's up with the checkpoints? - and how can u leave that out of the review? Easily the most hated aspect of Absolution. Can I now save my game where I want?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	@jmars89 yes
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	@jmars89 Combined auto-save and manual save exists in the game, letting you either safety-save before an action, or rely on the latest auto-svae when things go sideways.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	Yes
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	If the graphics engine weren't 20 years old...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	Oh here we go... Mr. Graphics.... Smh.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	@iGettinThatFoSho Lol yeah I hate running into those types. Game looks great to me. Then again I've been stuck looking at 3DS games for three years so maybe I'm tripping.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	@JRTheEnigma @iGettinThatFoSho The game looks great. Game makes for a nice pie. Sorry!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	@Show_Me_The_Money Wow. 3 years old, and it has been highly modified. Meanwhile, XCOM 2, for instance, runs on a variation of the TWELVE years old Unreal 3...and so do many other games....so, I don't think the graphics engine is really a problem, hmmm?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/10/hitman-episode-1-paris-review	@DannyBoy2k @Show_Me_The_Money Tell'em Steve-Dave!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	Nice spoiler with the sex thing. Good job ign!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	wow my dad just had to walk in on the part where it talks about a sex scene
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	Wow, what a great game.  I just picked this up on PS3 and finished it.  goodness; awesome experience.  when I finally get a ps4 one day, I'll def. pick this up, to play it again.  they even found some good musicians for the soundtrack.  :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	I am really enjoying this game. If you like story-driven games, this is for you. It's not an action game. More in the same boat as Telltale games, Murdered: Soul Suspect, and Crimes and Punishments: Sherlock Holmes. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	"This game is very different and fantastic. Play it and prepare for an emotional feast. It's INTENSE! It's completely worth living. This review doesn't know what it's talking about. This game is clearly not for this reviewer and as such it's extremely biased. 

The main characters aren't shallow, they're just regular human beings and that's what makes them more engrossing in this case. It's supposed to be like a movie. The sex scene works well and organically because it happens spontaneously. Under the tremendous pressure which the characters were, things like that can and do happen. It's not always behind candle lights and cashmere sheets after flirting and making plans for the future; the setting didn't allow that but people always have feelings!

Yes it starts slow but it's not a bad thing as you NEED to get used to the mechanics because they're so different. It also gives you a chance to immerse yourself in Ethan's great life and just as you get comfy with your new virtual architect life and connect with the character, it's all swallowed in darkness and tragedy occurs. It's great and poignant!

B-grade story?? Common now, it captures you early on and you're hooked till the end. I was so hooked and had to know what was gonna happen that I played the whole thing in one sitting! I came back afterwards to see all possibilities and platinum the game. It's one of my all-time favourites."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	@kewlguitar totally agree w/ everything you said.  super game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	7.5- too heavy water
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	"--> What is the point of this review? ""A game that was amazing and set the standard 6 years ago now feels dated and old, so we're downgrading our score.""???

Yeah. That's called PROGRESS. All games build upon the successes and learn from the failures of the games before it. That's called EVOLUTION.

That's like re-reviewing Unreal Tournament, or Quake 4 - games that were REVOLUTIONARY wen they came out - as mediocre games now because every developer since have used the lessons learned when playing UT or Q4 to improve their own games, pushing progress forwards, and ensuring that modern games now play better than those classics did back then.

If you're serious about gaming, then give this game a try, REGARDLESS of this Australian's knee-jerk review. The story, and the gameplay mechanics in HR, will have a HUGE impact on you as you play through the game, regardless if you were playing the original PS3 version six years ago or the new version now.

This game is great. Sure, it has its issues, as do all other games, but the experience the player lives through is worth whatever second rate gripes this IGN reviewer may have against the title."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	@fatbastardcanada I agree. IGN gave this game a ten? only several years ago. It's the same game. Makes you wonder if games coming out now are really tens or just hyped (:P)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	@fatbastardcanada The reviewer needs a new job. I've been looking forward to this remaster since the PS4 came out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	"@fatbastardcanada There is a difference in appreciating something as a classic, versus a contemporary cutting edge product.  I enjoy the idea that video games progress so much year to year because of how much technology informs the medium, but that does mean what was once great, is often replaced with better offerings.

Heavy Rain, like many video games over the past 40 years will be remembered for what they accomplished for their time by historians and admirers of the medium, but like so many silent, black and white, and special effect films, they will be replaced by better technologically advanced offerings."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	is it more like a light drizzle?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	"Finished first ever play-through.

Pro:
QTE's work pretty well with the ""action""
Ending was pretty cool (the ones that I got)

Con:
Ending wasn't worth the play-through
Controlling characters is clunky at best
Lot's of sound glitches and character/environment bugs
Probably worst voice acting in any game....ever.

This is a PS game that probably should have remained shelved, and skipped for the remastered series. I'm sure it was amazing when originally released but this was bad enough where I didn't want to finish the game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/03/heavy-rain-playstation-4-edition-review	the graphics actually look worse on the ps4.  I don't know what these revieweres are playing, but it does not look better than the ps3.  I don't know why anyone would want to get this if they already have it on ps3. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	I downloaded the Nintendo eShop version on Wii U and t was amazing, even though I knew it beforehand since I played it on an older console... Anyways, I am a bit upset though because of this glitch in the desert temple! Link seems to be having difficulty walking with normal speed, as if he's wearing the iron boots, in a chamber where speed is essential to cross to the next room! I was hoping to find new software update for that but I don't think there is any yet
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	"Why everyone is complaining about graphics? it's nintendo, graphics doesn't matter, remember ocarina of time? nintendo is focused on GREAT AND EPIC replayable games, not in epic graphics on shitty games like DIVISION, this Zelda game is a masterpiece, so... you will rank a book ""5.0 mediocre"" because the book doesn't have drawings? please give less importance to the superficial graphics and pay more atención to the EXPERIENCE of playing. (sorry for bad english, Mexican here)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	@quone Yah, true. But this is a HD version of Zelda. It should look different.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	Remake of the year!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	Seriously, the graphics are so poor its hard to call this hd anything. Are Nintendo fans so starved for content that they will over look a simple cash grab, charging you full price for a 10 year old game that most likely 12 people worked on for 3 months to update? Take that BB Nintendo c0ck out of your mouths just for a second and look at this product objectively. Or is your Nintendo c0ck worship so intense that you cant see the 6 to 9 feet to your tv? Bloody ridiculous that this game isnt getting panned by critics and consumers alike. If any company or any game was released with this lackluster of a job it would be burnt at the stake, but its Nintendo so 8.5/10 right? Just fucking sad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	@fallkan I don't think this is a cash grab. I mean, who doesn't like to play Twilight Princess on there WII U? But hey, it's somebody's opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	"I don't agree at all with IGN Jose Otero!  He gave Xenoblade Chronicles X a low 8 and now gives this HD remake a 8.6..  The only thing I have an issue in this game is the Controls!  They should allow you to use the Wii-U remote as well as the pro controller.  It was specifically designed to use the WII-U remote and frankly disappointed they are not allowing people to use it!  Anything less than 9 on this game is frankly wrong!!  And if you check when it originally came back out it was scored way higher???  With the HD picture it looks 2X as good and if this was the exact same game 10yrs ago with the HD it would have scored higher!!  So I think Jose ratings are completely messed up and would not trust it him rating Nintendo games!!! He should move along and play XBOX since that's probably his style more anyways!!  Its one of the best ZELDA GAMES!!!

ps. he gave a + on controls - WTF!!  The controls have NOT IMPROVED - I think it got WORSE!!!! "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	"Better than Ocarina in every way.
And Ocarina is awesome so thats saying a lot!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	Like this game but I think Windwaker is better
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	Frankly it's the best looking zelda with the exception of windwaker hd
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/01/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess-hd-review	The game does look better than the Wii and Gamecube versions of the TP but it still doesn't measure up to today's graphics. I enjoyed revisiting the characters and the cool storylines of TP again but felt that the control system was a massive downgrade. Motion controls suit 3D zelda games perfectly. The fact that Nintendo ditched them in favor of the clunky Wii U pad was disappointing. Sword play and bow aiming seemed so much more intuitive on the Wii. The Wii U is fully compatible with the Wii-mote and Nunchuck so there was absolutely no reason to not add the OPTION of using them in-game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@BERT0503 Probably. I'm still looking to get it on Xbox because I don't have a PC handy that I can hook up to my TV for splitscreen. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@BERT0503 its the same on everything have them both prefer the Xbox version because of the dlc being included 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@BERT0503 The Xbox One version is pretty much the definitive edition, I'm pretty sure it comes with the dlc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@Speedy67 @BERT0503 Not much is Definitive on Xbox One. Those timed exclusives haven't helped.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@Shadynastys69 Yes. That is what the game is. Only offline you should really be doing is training.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	So addictive
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	just purchased! This PS4 sale is insane! Picking up MKX too. Cheers
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	I've only played this on PC, and highly advise getting it. It's a great competitive game with tons of replay-ability. If you have it for another system, it may not be worth snagging on an xb1 unless you have friends that play on the xb1. I prefer the xb1 controller over the PS4, but that isn't really relevant since I can use either on a PC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	I've put almost 200 hours into this game on PS4. Fantastic game, almost always fun and engaging. If you are on the fence about it, you really should play this game. Playing with friends, however, raises the fun level exponentially.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@123heelclick agreed. haven't stopped playing for days. just got into it this week. It's hard to explain how satisfying pulling off shots and saves can be
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	Fun game but I would never pay $$$ for it. Make it free on XBL and I might pick it up again
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@TheXXZ Best 20 bucks I have spent
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@TheXXZ If your so cheap that you can't afford to pay the devs a measly $20 (honestly, they deserve MUCH MUCH MORE), then please leave gaming!  This is obviously not the hobby for you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@TheXXZ Everyone can thank people with attitudes like this for our current wave of free-to-play, microtransaction bullshit.

I do like getting a bang for my buck, so $20 total for the game and all it's DLC included.

DLC has to be on sale as well.

Free to play is cool as well."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	Northernlights nailed it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@TheXXZ If you already have it for another system the $20 isn't really worth it, but if you don't, it's worth the $20.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@TheXXZ I got the game for free...THEN paid $20 so my brother could have it too. That's how much fun this game is. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@adamoore20 @TheXXZ yeah, I bought it on ps4 to play with my ps friends, and converted my xb1 friends and bought them copies too, because my ps friends stopped playing with me. totally worth the 80 i've invested in it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/rocket-league-xbox-one-review	@TheXXZ Can you explain the logic. Why would you never pay money for it. It's a better game than most $60 AAA games.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-review	PVZ was a fun strategy game. Why did it become a third shooter? How dissapointing. There are enough shooter games out there but only one PVZ. EA took a winner and turned it into a loser. They should not put PVZ on the name. It is misleading.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-review	so two mark downs by ign standards this should b a  6.7
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-review	Stfu, this is an amazing under rated game, it should be a 10 to at least 9.5, biiiitttcccchhhh
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-review	Does this game still have a large playerbase.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/23/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2-review	Not on PC unfortunately. At least if you live in Australia, couldn't vouch for the other regions as Ping is too bad for me to try.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	I'm not sure you could expect much more of a plot in prehistoric times.. I mean.. that was pretty much life... compete for food, resources, territory.. It's not like they are gonna be arguing over business deals, or something.. lol

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	"I prefer an under used cast with better atmosphere to the embarrassing attempt at writing and voice acting the far cry series has recently become infected with.
No I don't need to see someones face literally nose to nose yelling at me about how sad they are or how unfair the world is when they damn well cause just as much death and destruction as the ""bad guys""  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	Best game I have played in a very long time, it's fun and the world is beautiful. No other game is like this, survial in the stone age, plenty of wild beats to hunt, kill and tame, huge world of exploration, and awesome tactics and gameplay. Can you tame a tiger or jaguar and teach it to tattack on your command, Yes! Lots of close quarters combat with spears and clubs, riding Wooly Mammoths?! Need I say more? Game is a 9.5 plus.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	I'm a big fan of Ubisoft games, but just cannot like this one. Sorry, Ubi, but this is really bad game...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	@Classicnerd I just need clarity on what you mean by a bad game. Are the events in this game not historically accurate? Are the weapons too advanced or too primitive for this time period? Or do you just keep dying and miss the unrealistic gameplay the previous Far Cry installments had to offer. As an experienced outdoor bushmaster, I have to say this game is pretty realistic from the element factors all the way to the history itself (regarding Central/Eastern Europe). This is a survival game at it's finest if you ask me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	@OsoGoo @Classicnerd You are an experienced bushmaster... hahaha  U are more likely a adolescent child. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	@OsoGoo @Classicnerd What I mean is the game looks bad, and the characters are just repulsive. And the game has nothing to do with real history. Methods of hunting are a joke. The game is also very easy, just as every other Ubisoft game these days.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	This game is outrageous fun!  It should have scored at least a 9.0
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	"this review is steaming with pretentiousness and misguided criticism.  there was no such thing as charisma back then and there was no such thing as nuance.  the plot doesnt undermine the game with simplicity because in 10,000 b.c. there were no complex subplots, only survival.  IGN has really taken the prissy stupidity of ""higher art"" and slapped video game fans in the face with it.   This is an absolutely terrible review of an otherwise great game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	@fartert The review seems quite reasonable to me, although I've only played about 8 hours of the game. I also read Gamespot reviews and their one says more or less the same thing for Primal. To be honest Primal is not a hard game to review. The pros and cons are obvious. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	"I agree 100%. this game is so much fun...a ""Con"" was character development! it's a f'n video game. I can tame a tiger and ride Willy mammoths in a huge amazing complex stoneage world!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	@fartert pretentious review? are you a thick headed idiot?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	Review summed the game up absolutely perfect, just didn't put QUITE enough emphasis on how much FUN the game actually is. Whereas most games with a simple formula wear out quickly, I could watch my cave bear maul Udam soldiers until the end of time! It's just that addictingly fun. Great job Ubi! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	I was wondering why I never heard of this game. Every new Far Cry release was a big deal before this monstrosity! (sigh) Are development companies purposely trying to destroy the gaming industry now? It's also very interesting that they did not provide a score rating for this game! I suppose seeing the horrible rating would be triggering LOL! This is what happens when you throw reality to the wolves! You basically get (WTH is this?) 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/22/far-cry-primal-review	@AbbieHoffman Reality to the wolves? Because jumping out of a homemade helicopter then hopping on an elephant and unloading your rocket launchers is realistic. This game really isn't that unrealistic other than taming animals, but even that's possible (dances with wolves). I don't know how you didn't hear about this game, it had full page ads on ign for a week. Also, there is a score... 7.9. It's not bad, no worse than 4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/16/street-fighter-5-review-repromo	"I enjoyed the review, Vince. It's baffling to me that there is no Arcade Mode. The way I play any fighter when jumping in for the first time goes in this order- training mode, trials, arcade mode and then online.
Now it looks like I'm going to have to go training mode -> online. I don't like this at all. I always prefur to discover a fighting game at my own pace before jumping into Multiplayer.

Also, I've seen some reviews complaining about the lack of stages. One of my annoyances with the Fighting Game genre as a whole is the lack of stages/Arenas. Think about it, if an Action Adventure game has to create 10+ hours worth of environments for a player to explore, then why is it that Fighting games can only provide between 5 and 15 very small arenas? WHY!??!?! 

All of that said, this is my most anticipated game of the year so, I can not wait to play it tomorrow :-)"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	"I have all the Naruto Games on 360 and this is the best one easily. Adventure Mode after the Story mode gives you the life after the epic battle. Visual and gameplay its the best fighting game I've ever played and I'm 34!! So I've played alot and own alot of fighting games. This reviewers Complaints are way off and so is his review. He doesn't understand or know how to play the game so he hates on it. 
His complaints don't exist if your actually good at the game which he isn't. If you are a Naruto fan buy it its worth the investment. 9/10 forsure. 

(PS. for ppl saying its just button a masher including the reviewer, Please play me and try to just button mash and see how that works out for you)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	@BatwomanLover thank you, was looking for something like this....played 2 on 360, want this but might wait for legacy so I get all of them
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	compared to storm 3 the fighting system sucks now...good luck locking your enemy in a combo..u cant..pvp is a mess ..just a bunch of noobs button mashing..this game should be a upgrade not a downgrade..ill go back to my 360 have fun in pvp
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	@gordo1405 I have Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 and it s not better, The controls are fine and work perfectly if you give yourself a few fights to adjust i've played and beaten all the others and own them aswell, This game is epic and is no different the fighting system is actually better in this game than part 3, Your super Move meter can be done more than once or twice also your Disappearing counter shinobi ability is available for more use and easily recharged, And when you die you have a choice how you come back to fight and don't have to start from the beginning, Part 3 was bad for that. Ultimate storm 4 is alot better than 3, Your lying to yourself if you say otherwise and are not a true fan of the series.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	"You were surprised that you had issues finding an online match? The game is made for children and early teens who are already obsessing over Black Ops 3. Furthermore, fighting fanatics have already moved to SF V. Couple that with huge balancing issues that the series has had (because how tf are you going to balance that many characters in a roster?) and you've got people who don't even bother. I was looking for reviews on this game and was baffled as to why it was so highly acclaimed. Apparently, people highly applauded the story and amount of content but missed the key point of why many go to fighters in the first place. Turns out that the reviews were just a sweet dream and the reality is that these kinds of games will always fall shy of the more technical games like MK or SF. People go to fighting games because of the combos and the amount of people they can beat online. No one really pays attention to the story. Especially a story that you can find out about by reading a manga comic or watch online somewhere.
If you want a fighter that isn't too technical, play smash bros. Well I mean until you start playing for Glory anyway."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	"""refines the gameplay to the absolute best of the series""
Unfortunately the gameplay isn't that good to begin with. Just Platinum'd it for my love of Naruto but put it up to sell. Made a couple combo videos but besides that there isn't enough deep, advanced strategy or mindgames that don't get destroyed by random chaos mechanics.

The game would actually be good if they made these changes:
1) max subs at 2 - or keep at 4 but are gone til next round - or 1 sub and it regenerates slowly immediately, grows as you get hit
2) get meter slowly by getting hit, get meter quickly by attacking
3) segment meter into four 1/4s or something precise so that special moves actually take a bar
4) remove armour break (constant attacking). this downplays good defence
5) increase damage and speed of grabs
6) allow blocked strings to be cancelled into nothing without meter, no dash, just nothing. this sets up throw/grab/unblockable game
7) give characters flash colour state on invincible frames
8) make blocked specials super unsafe on block and counter hit state on recovert: 1.25 dmg taken by next hit"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	"I IMMEDIATE TAKE THIS BACK. After spending 3 more days in the lab with this game, it has opened up beyond Street Fighter and is among BlazBlue/P4A.

Wow I am keeping this game for years to come and helping disect it with the community. One that is usually associated with Casualness, which is a big mistake if you look at some of the monsters hiding."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	@BankeA Can you elaborate please? Really considering buying this and need some decent opinions.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	"@DoctorVanBosh @BankeA really sorry about the confusion man. i just had a lot of opinions I needed to blow on this game. I ultimately sold the game last week because fundamentally it's got some super broken things in the high level play. I made some videos and guides which was fun.

all in all it's a must play for Naruto fighting fans, for a while. if you get it on disc then you always have the option to sell if you feel the end content doesn't offer you anything. the multiplayer can be either dead or decent depending on your country. I'm in New Zealand for example, so it's a null feature.

hope you enjoy it!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	@BankeA Controls are fine maybe your not good at the game or? You don't know how to play it. ppl say its just button mashing? I would love to play any of you who say its just button mashing and I'll show you guys real quick that its not. I will destroy anybody who thinks they can just button mash against me. Thats hilarious anybody whos says that doesn't know how to play the game or hasn't played it before.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	cant find matches online at all on x1. went to my brothers who has the game on P4 n got n2 a match SAP. BS man.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/09/naruto-shippuden-ultimate-ninja-storm-review	This roster is a weak as hell simply because it's the last in the series and they didn't even add th seven swordsman of the mist, rinkaku and ginkaku, or any of the hokages escorts the rosters from this game has'nt really changed since 2 honestly they finally added the sound four from before shippeden and characters only can use 2 jutsu I'd give it a 3/10 it's really a slap in the face to die hard fans of the anime
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	You forgot to talk about those wonderful OSTs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	"Unravel is one the most involving games I've played in a very long time. Comparisons to other games are useless as they are mere surface comparisons. All 2D platformers are not the same. Limbo was stylistic but oddly vacant and mainly required the player to make sure the character jumped at the right time, but is considered a classic regardless of its limitations. Child of Light has a wonderful style, but is combat based rather than puzzle orientated. The ingeniuosly, frustrating Ori and the Blind Forest is difficult, but not due to the games design, but your abilities (I died 744 times in my first play through. I felt like a king when I finished.)
Unravel has a beautiful, strange world that is both realistic and magical. Yarny, a bright red taut piece of wool, shouldn't work in the environment, but he blends in majestically. The story is weaved in subtly and with heart. Enemies make perfect sense, and the encroaching darker tone that preceded chapters was excellent. Death comes easy sometimes, but as there is an achievement for never dying, I'm going to rise to the challenge and keep Yarney alive through the his entire quest.
The best character in a game for years isn't a wise cracking, gun-toting moron super soldier. It's a red piece of wool called Yarney. Roll on Unravel 2."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	This was a very good game. Beautiful, fun, and sweet. Much better than Firewatch, yet for some reason it's almost an entire point lower on IGN...oh well. I give it an 8.5/10 and Firewatch a 6/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	Remember seeing a preview of this last year and was surprised to see that it released without much fanfare. I knew there something special about this game and have been thoroughly enjoying it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	This game is so amazing. It's very underrated. I don't think it's too easy or boring either. I love the way they incorporate puzzles into this game. Going from the witness to this was a delight. I gave up around 350 panels completed in the witness. It became mentally exhausting. Trust me I want to finish it one day but I don't think I can do it without a guide (which I refuse to sully the game with) but with unravel the puzzles are more straightforward and flow easy with the platforming (which is also extremely easy imo but that's not a bad thing) but the game still manages to keep you immersed and actively engaged every second with great scope and context. I don't think they wasted a frame in this game. It's so well made. One of my new favorites. I love the house hub world too. And yarny is a charming character for something that should be so devoid of personality.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	This game is like the more interactive version of Flower.  In other words, perfect, relaxing gaming bliss :D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	Im having a blast with this game.  Also, if you want to make your own Yarny, here you go - http://www.unravelgame.com/unravel-make-yarny-guide.html.  $20 for this game on Origin is a nice price and if you do not like it, you have 24 hours to do a refund on it as well
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	Game was great until chapter 11 last leaf...the controls trying to move that lantern were atrocious...I got so frustrated I uninstalled it lol...they must have been drunk designing that level...7/10 for me..that just killed the fun of it for me
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	@gamersince78 That was also the only part I found frustrating. You missed the ending though man! It was great. Made me cry lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	Finished this today. Beautiful, very sweet game. Glad I picked it up.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/unravel-review	I enjoyed this game a tonne. And I didn't even need YouTube to get me through the puzzles! Quite some achievement for me :D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	one of the worst game's i have played so far
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	This game is a waste of money don't buy it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	"Looks nice with some lovely ambient music at times. I do enjoy games like this but found Firewatch very underwhelming almost boring.
Story had a promising start but the ending was frankly just rubbish."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	"Game is like ""Gone Home""  they charge $20 for a brief story and zero gameplay.  At least walking dead gives you choices and interesting characters.  This is just a ripoff.  The story is all over the place, you don't quite know whats going on until the very end and then it doesn't really have much impact.  The most interesting part of the story is your characters back story which is not resolved so there's no real point to mention it except to fill space.  Stop using the ""amazing"" reviewers.  It's amazing because you play all the games and for free so when something that is not a shooter comes out you drool over it.  The normal person who only plays a dozen games a year won't find it ""amazing"" just very common and uninteresting.  There's more drama is one episode of a Netflix show and that only costs $7.99 a month.  **THEY DEACTIVATED THE RATING FOR THIS, WONDER WHY.  6 OUT OF 10"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	What a buggy piece of junk!  The game hung on me after several hours of playing, and the developer's only solution is to restart the game.  Pathetic.  I'm sorry I wasted $10 on this POS...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	"This review was spot-on. Despite the anticlimactic ending, the journey was worth every step through the wilds. My only gripe was the heavy orange/yellow hues in their palette, otherwise the entire experience was completely lifted by absolutely brilliant voice-acting, an intriguing script with surprising plot-twists and refreshing adult themes, and the haunting need for it to continue . . .

Really hoping Team Campos Santo rides the wave of these reviews and expands on what they've already built here. Feels kind of genre-busting to me, and that, my friends, is kind of nice for a change."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	Love it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	enjoyable game for adults, which clearly leaves out some posters here
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	The folks at Campo Santo should be rewarded for their damage control! Firewatch is in the fire-extinguishing business after all. Always best to put out small fires before they get wind and out of control. How come no one discusses how short and clunky the game is? or that nothing much happens and its so drawn out and boring? Yes, it has one or two nice pretty pictures which you see in the advertisements but nothing much else in-game. Their concept would have been better suited for a coffee table book or public message poster. Henry fumbling around in the amateurishly drawn fake bushes for 3+ hours does not a great video game make. For a game to be considered truly “great” it has to show some promise for innovation and gameplay otherwise its a digression into the murky past. Firewatch is at best a mod or a solo game designer’s final school project.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	@Nick_Carmine lame
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/firewatch-review	"I completely agree with this review. Firewatch is an incredibly engaging game, with an outstanding script. I found myself reporting everything I could to Delilah, partly because the script was so fantastic, but partly because the game does such a good job at making you feel completely alone with a huge area to explore. I also think the art style is outstanding.

As mentioned, the ending was lackluster, and I did complete the game annoyingly quickly - but this is a game I can certainly see myself coming back to. I would really like to stray from the main quest line a little more and I feel like there's a whole lot more to discover.

Great game and a spot on review."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	so basically, the reviewer sucked at the game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	@MrOga Seems like it, not an entirely fair review in my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	Not a surprising score for an xbox game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	"Sounds like pretty crappy reviewing. His review is 25 points lower than any other on metacritic. 
Maybe that car accident knocked a few screws loose."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	Wait a sec...I never saw any beta versions of the game! There were just alpha versions! WHY?!?!?!?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	"Ok, here goes. I think this review is bullshit. I have completed this game on my Xbox 360 and I think this game is absolutely fantastic. I have not encountered any bugs in my 20+ hours spent in this game. Granted, the boss fights aren't that great, but that s the ONLY problem I've encountered with this game. I could go on for hours with all the sweet things that have happened thanks to the great stages and mechanics. One thing to remember when playing: You HAVE to think FAST! A lot of your deaths could've been easily avoided.

My Score: 8.7 "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	Looks like IGN Spain had no issues with this with their score of 8.0 they gave this game http://es.ign.com/cobalt-pc/99956/review/cobalt-analisis-para-pc-y-xbox-one
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	It's obvious they should have released a walking sim on PS4 instead. IGN loves that shit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	@GasKing Just seems like you are mad that Microsoft ruins every dev they buy 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	"Has anyone noticed how biased the steam review section and forums is like for this game ? Its like those imdb 10/10 ratings where the co workers are coming in and spamming the rating up and saying its good. Its currently 6.0 on metacritic both from critic and user reviews but ""overly positive"" on steam, yea right. Really disgusting they have gone in there and spammed their game so it looks good when its getting bad reviews everywhere. Stay clear of this generic flash game and use your money where it belongs like on Unravel or something else thats good currently."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	@TheGamerPandA  What are you talking about it has great reviews everywhere except this IGN review. They are all 9s and 8s and like one 7, all recommending the game. Metacritic for PC is an 80. It's a 67 for Xbox one solely because of this review. They are missing a lot of reviews between the Xbox and PC versions on Metacritic. There are only two user reviews on Metacritic, a 10 and a 9. Don't know why it says average 6. Likely a typo. Have you even played it? It's terrific. Give it a try.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	wow, so surprised by the bad score. loving this game myself, the campaign, challenges and the pvp. Would recommend strongly to anyone who likes platformers
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	"First off, (not to be rude) you are a terrible player! Many of those deaths were because you werent even moving, I have put 12 hours into this game and most deaths you showed could have been easily avoided! You just gotta remember that the enemies drop what thier holding if it's a throwable, and not roll into them. Yes, the boss battles are kind of lame... But overall I thought the story was good. Also, not shure about why everyone dislikes the graphics so much, I think they look great. It's 2D.

P.S. You didn't talk about the mapmaker! Or is that a PC exclusive, because it is very functional and easy to learn.
Thx for reading..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/cobalt-review	@Arduino13 agreed, I guess this game isn't for unskilled gamers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	Actually from all three this entry is my favourite. I would rate them 1. Russia 2. China 3. India
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	So is this game's story based on the comics that starred Nikolai Orev because they were very good from what i remember. P.S. Daniel Cross was completely underutilised in AC3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	The first Assassins Creed will always be my favorite. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	Holy shit balls fix your video player, I know it's been said to death yet it's still balls
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	i swear do they hire business people at ubisoft? do they not understand that releasing trash like this just hurts their brand and IP? Makes it look weak and pathetic in the long term. Assassins creed could have been so much more than it is, its ashame its turned out the way it has. It still has alot of potential, hopefully they can up there game a bit. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	They aren't making a main Assassins Creed game, but instead they are making god awful spinoffs instead lol. Ubisoft when people said take a break we meant altogether and that means spinoffs!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	Russia, really? At this point Ubisoft is just messing with everyone who wants an Assassin Creed in Japan with ninjas, making games about pretty much every country BUT Japan
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	"@sauro_dinus Ironically, Russia was an intended scenario from way back when... the original series creator had intended it to be the scenario for the third game before he left the company. It would have been the third AC game. Instead, we got Brotherhood, Revelations, that other ""third"" AC game, and many more to follow. Fast forward and we get this title where they probably re-cycled some of those original ideas and concepts for it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	@wratts @sauro_dinus How do you know that Russia would have been the setting for AC3?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	I'm done with the franchise, I had such great memories staying up late and completing story missions. Desmond's story kinda gave it closure, Black Flag was a bonus. But I tried playing Unity and Rouge, I kinda liked it but still felt repetitive and feels like the franchise is evolving really slow. Not gonna even give Syndicate a shot but now on to new things. Maybe I will come back to it one day.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	"@GodofChaos2015

Syndicate is really fun. It's not a masterpiece but it's pretty entertaining. As a hardcore Assassin's Creed fan (I bought the first one, one or two days after it was released, haven't stopped since) I'm also considering stopping if they don't up their game. It's a good sign they're taking this year off for the next installment (I read it will probably be in Egipt) They need to take their time. One thing I love though,  as a history lover, the historical cities and characters, damn. And the games always look beautiful, it's really noticeable that they take their time in getting the details on the infrastructure. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	@TheCrimsonKing19 @GodofChaos2015 that I can't deny, the characters and history are just so detailed. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	@TheCrimsonKing19 @GodofChaos2015 im a long time fan too and i just coulnt help but not like syndicate, it was just so dull for me. The characters were a bit improved but again the main story was weak, the ai is stupid and on top of that it looked worse than unity. I remember being a young boy excited about an AC every year after playing the first 2. Now i kind of wish they didnt go down that path. Also wow syndicate was short compared to past games, i could have swore ac2 was like twice the length 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	@GodofChaos2015 Why would you stay up late? Go to sleep, nerd.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	Black Flag was my favorite, I loved upgrading my ship and exploring the Caribbean, Edwards character and storyline were awesome too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	Revelations sucked, Black Flag is awesome, Unity Sucked, Syndicate ROCKS
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	@J4ckJ3ckel r u kidding me? revelations was awesome especially the ending.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/08/assassins-creed-chronicles-russia-review	@phatelal22 @J4ckJ3ckel the whole al tair, ezio, desmond thing was epic but the rest of the game left alot to be desired. If i remember rightly thats where it started to go downhill in a big way. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	Really wanted to like this game, in fact i do but i cannot get passed the mission briefings and the world map intel choices. Why cant they just have a skirmish mode, where you can pick your team and any weapon and choose any level and enemy type?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	Huge fan of the game and the series but the flaws are horrible...I have a fairly strong pc (gtx1070 and an i7) and it crashes to desktop fairly regularly with no warning. I would gladly call this goty material but not until they optimize it and actually put the effort into stabilizing and making it right
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	"A game with unacceptable technical flaws and glitches on PS4. It crashed more than just about any console game I can think of. This is not this developer's first problem with technically unsound games either. ""X-Com Enemy Within"" on the PS3 had a game-breaking glitch that rendered it unplayable. The load times are utterly atrocious as well. I would automatically subtract 3 points out 10 just for the technical problems and go down from there- it's closer to a 5/10. 
Also, it really pisses me off that IGN has no regard for the fact that a consumer has to PAY for these broken products whereas they get review copies from developers for FREE so they're always more forgiving of such flaws."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@Charlemagne84 I had Xcom EW on the PS3 and never had a problem with it. It seemed to work pretty well for me. Perhaps you just had a bung copy...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@Charlemagne84 It was left with the pc review (i think). But not at all surprised that the console version would have loading times 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	"@Charlemagne84 Have both for PC, but I did get Enemy Within for XB - never had any problems on my end. Load times were bad, but nothing like Elder Scrolls load times. I wouldn't call XCOM in anyway a broken game, with many other games out there actually being broken - XCOM is legend my friend. 
Maybe your copy was a dud."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	STFU.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	Only like 50 new comments. You guys drag these awards out for way too long. It's a new year, 2016 is over, everyone is focused on the games of the future.....and IGN is still hung up on 2016 GOTY lol. Over a month is too long, this is not the Oscars. WRAP IT UP, nobody cares anymore lmao.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@udanoob Most of them are on vacation i think
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	Whats the difference between the difficulties? The combat was annoying enough on easy when your overwatch team miss every shot and ruin your ambush
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	"@Fordy269  The big differences are that enemies have more health and have fewer aim penalties. You also get fewer resources, I believe.

Overwatch is supposed to miss pretty often - there's an aim penalty (which you can negate with some upgrades)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@DanStapleton @Fordy269 Enemies have armor upgrades too I think no? Always have to get Shredder with the Heavy's.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	I got tired of the limited turn missions which are way too common, in fact I think they are most of the missions I did. Limited turn missions limit strategy and forced me to rush through the level. I know I can get mods that take out the limited turns, but judging the game in its release state I thought it was more frustrating than enemy within.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@MachineSpirit  Time limits are there to counteract one of the big complaints about Enemy Unknown: with nothing forcing you forward, you can slowly tip-toe through a level, which makes it a slow, boring cakewalk.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	"I felt the time limits forced me to play in just a specific different way. Instead of being slow and plotting moves, each mission just turns into blow up every wall in my way and straight shot everything.
Maybe if the countdown didn't start until after I broke concealment and the aliens knew I was there it would be easier to swallow."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@Mike_Turner Yeah, making the turn limit appear after concealment was blown would have been better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	"Is ign still going ?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@StarOceanBlue I honestly don't know how IGN are considered one of the best gaming sites since they repost everything a month later to get more clicks and their coverage is either late or just copied from another source etc. according to Kotaku hint hint. I'm only still here because the community is lively.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	I bought this game on Steam a few months back and never played it. I guess I gotta get to it. Damn Steam sales.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@agetro82 You really ought to. I can't stop playing it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@agetro82 I liked it for 1 play through and it was over 40h i think for me... But i liked the first more 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@agetro82 Do it, and I recommend after a play through getting into some of the mods. The Halo armor mods look legit, rolling into combat with 6 Spartans in XCOM seems like it could take place in any Halo game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@chezmark14 @agetro82 Being the huge nerd I am, I like to start them out as marines, as they progress through the ranks I make them ODSTs and finally when they are full badass they earn the spartan armor.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	"shame about the bugs, i'm so far into the game... i can't get past any levels now, as when it's my new turn... i get no option to do anything just scroll around the map.

game just pauses and crashes... doesn't matter if i load  up any of my 5 last saves (even in geo mode) any mission i go on.. after a few turns it repeats.

devs ignore my PS4 videos on the forums, and most people tell me to ""start again and hope the same thing never happens""

so no. not going to do that. another 30 hours and wiping all MY troops. no one's got time for that."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	I wanted to buy for ps4 but when i hear something like that... i can't understand how such huge huge glitches don't get patched....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/01/xcom-2-review	@Franconian They don't patch it because Firaxis doesn't give a shit.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	I didnt even know this existed o.O

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	"Great studio and a great game. Played through the first one on PS4 with 60fps and loved it. I have an Xbox One but will wait for a GOTY edition on PS4. All DLC and 60fps for $59.99.

Until then.....The Division, Doom, Uncharted 4 etc. etc."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	@wcas62731 It won't be 60fps on PS4. For fuck's sake, it can't even maintain 60fps on PC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	The PC version is widely considered to be one of the most well-optimized console ports in recent years; if your set-up cannot run it at a stable 60FPS, that is your rig's fault, not the game's.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	@GodParticle Believe me, I am well above the recommended specs, and I'm not the only one who gets unstable framerate. See, the thing is the game might be well optimized, but it's not consistent. So you start the game, play for a few hours and it runs perfectly fine, and then you get to the Soviet Installation which straight up murders your framerate. And then you keep going, and you leave and your framerate goes back up for a while, until you get to the Geothermal Valley, which kills your framerate even more than the other place. When you're in the linear parts of the game, everything's fine, regardless of how many explosions and other special effects the game throws at you. It just can't maintain the same performance once you get to the open hub areas.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	@christophe2315 @GodParticle Sounds like its an issue with your PC. The vast majority say its well optimize and even Digital Foundry found the same. What are your specs and what res are you running it at? I am running it with a GTX 980 Ti on a 3440x1440p monitor. I get Mostly High with one or two medium settings at a constant 60fps with some drops to 50s. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	"@livewire34 @christophe2315 @GodParticle GTX 980 on a 1080p monitor. I've actually heard a lot of people with the same card or 970s make that same complaint. The problem isn't that I can't get 60fps, it's that the game's inconsistency makes it difficult to pinpoint the right settings. You can practically max everything out without issue for the first three hours of the game, and then your performance drops dramatically. That's the funny thing: all the websites testing the game's performance only played the intro and found that it ran supremely well. Then you get to the big hub areas and your framerate drops in the 40s.
 The problem is that it leaves you with the shitty choice of either playing your game with lower settings in parts where your PC could absolutely handle higher settings, tolerating the drops in the hub areas or spending more time tuning your settings based on where you are than actually playing the game.

You know, I've always wondered why we can't just have games that dynamically adjust certain settings. Framerate drops under 60fps, game dials the lighting back a notch. Everything running smoothly, game maxes everything out. Would be nice."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	This review hits the nail on head. exactly what I was thinking - boring having to roam around Soviet Installation and disappointed not to find a new tomb. Bit cheeky that the trailer claimed hours of new gameplay; I suppose with the 2 hours it took to finish it, they weren't technically lying!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	Why does IGN never list the price of games or DLC, as if it doesn't have a bearing on its rating, when it really, clearly does?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	@KnivesOut00 @tjchief87 LOL I know right?!?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	Played the game on Xbox One, but when it came out on PC i couldn't help myself. Bought it again, with the DLC. I gotta say, the 2nd play through on a harder difficulty is so much better for me. I think the game was just different than i expected, and now i'm really enjoying it for what it is (lots of snow.) I just began the DLC, and to me it's what the game was missing. I liked the first game due to the supernatural, creepy stuff. Now RISE has it too, so that helps. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	This feels like a DLC that will work much better for people who play it during the course of the game, rather than those going back to play it. The gear is probably not worth it unless you play it as early as possible, and even then limited in use, so it would have been nice to have something more functional for late game. I also think the time factor would have been worse for people jumping back in. For me, it was an aside from the building climax of the main campaign that was very enjoyable, but didn't keep me from my task for too long. I thought it was a great piece of additional content.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	The boss battle is brilliant and the story is fairly solid, but this is WAY too short. It cost about £8 in the UK and lasted about an hour and half, which I think we can all agree is poor form, even by modern DLC standards. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-baba-yaga-the-temple-of-the-witch-review	@PrettyShambolic That is one of the more entertaining boss battles I've done in a game in a while now. Pretty lengthy by average standards.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	Just got it in the Steam summer sale and it's easily the worst Lego game I've ever played. It honestly just seems lazy. There are constant glitches. The audio is pretty bad. Some of the environments are really terrible looking. Like the water in the back ground the first time you're on the Helicarrier is just a picture of water. Still enjoyable, but not great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	At least they fixed the god awful flying that they had in LEGO Marvel Surper Heroes.  Shame there weren't side missions Like Deadpool's
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	anyone else having serious crash issues? like rampant...making the game completely unplayable?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	I'm just happy that we get Doctor Strange, She Hulk, and Moon Knight as playable characters.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	@NateOspades we had all those and more in the first lego marvel game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	Really? I guess i should go back and play it again and pay attention this time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	"""Attempts at keeping the game as close to the movies as possible also affected the audio in unfortunate ways. Lines of dialogue pulled straight from the films and mixed into the game sound really unnatural, and dull compared to some of the newly recorded lines from Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill and Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson. While on paper the idea of using the voices of actors we’ve come to know from the films sounds like it would make the game feel much more authentic, it also means a lot of awkward silences and repetition of lines - they couldn’t record new dialogue, so instead they sometimes don’t say anything at all where it seems like they should.""

This was a problem in Lego Jurassic World as well.

Wait, what exactly did Greg Miller do in this game?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	@Dreadjaws He voiced Aldrich Killian (the villain from Iron Man 3).

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	"The one ""good"" innovation the game has... is a freaking QTE?  Are you serious?  Well, this will have to wait until it's at around $5 on Steam."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	I am a real fan of lego games, but Lego Marvel Avengers on the ps vita would be a bad idea to get because the graphics do not look right, when the characters talk when not in a cutscene, their mouths don't even move it stays the same expression as they put it.Lastly, in the trailer it says that you would have The Avengers, Iron Man 3, Thor the dark world, Captain America winter soldier, and Avengers age of ultron. Put for ps vita it is just the avengers and avengers age of ultron. So if you are a ps vita owner and like lego marvel avengers DON'T GET IT FOR PS VITA.#disappointed

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/27/lego-marvels-avengers-review	LEGO City WiiU set the standard for LEGO games. I actually still play it years later, it cracks me up. Ever since then other LEGO games have felt dull (except LEGO Batman 3). The reviewer hit the nail on the head with this review. It was a lazy attempt at a big title. Totally lost the spark that makes LEGO unique (e.e. their own silly scripts and voice acting, none of this cheap-ass, dodgy rubbish taking sound directly from the film).

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	"started the game this week and i'm totally addicted. the RNG does get on your nerves sometimes though. one time i had my party pretty much at full hp and had to fight 4 spiders in a random encounter. it was very dark + RNG allowed all 4 spiders to make a move before any of my chars could. the 1st marked my healer and the other ones fucked her up with special marked damage so that the 4th could deal the killing blow on her. just like that, not a single thing i could have done (you can only try to escape if it's the turn of one of your chars). the game just came and killed one of my chacracters like it was nothing. and on top of that spiders are by far the easiest enemies i've seen so far. they only have 7 hp so a lot of my chars usually kill 2 in one swoop. thankfully this happened early on so now i know what to expect. 
it's a shame though that randomness plays such a huge part in the difficulty of the game. still loving it though and can't stop."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	Just because PCGamer chose it as the best RPG doesn't mean you guys have to. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	But also they could
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	A Lovecraftian cosmic horror turn based RPG version of XCOM. Such a good game! My biggest complaint is there is a little too much grinding.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	"Oh jeeze, not you too IGN!  This is NOT a frackin RPG.  It's drastically closer to XCOM than any RPG, and xcom had more RPG elements.  Do not buy this game thinking you are getting an RPG.  There is base building, upgrades for troops, perma death on your troops.  The only role they mention is in the 30 second intro at the start where they say you are the heir to the property.  Aside from that, there are no interactions between characters (because there are none) no real interaction between your troops, etc.

That being said, it's an amazing game and is a ton of fun.  Just don't buy it thinking you're getting something like Baldur's Gate, or Dragon Age, or Skyrim, or Fallout, etc."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	@murdoch113 It is an RPG, do you know how many RPG's and years went by before they even had the elements you mention? I used to love Crystal Warriors on the Sega Game Gear to give you an example which also has none of the things you'd quantify and RPG but that makes it no less and RPG. Also, I loved Baldur's Gate, Dragon Age too hopefully you're looking forward to Planescape: Numenera too :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/26/darkest-dungeon-review	Wish I had the time to play this.  Quite fun when it was in early access.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	"This game is really amazing, but set your expectations accordingly. This isn't in the same vein as The Talos Principle. Mystery is not the driving force. Its all about the puzzles. When you solve puzzles, you don't get new story fed to you. The reward is more puzzles. If that doesn't sound like it would click for you, then you should look elsewhere. 

In an odd way, this is to hardcore puzzle fans what Call of Duty or Halo is to shooter fans. I know it sounds crazy, but just like those games, a lot of people are going to hate it for what it is, or isn't because it lacks the elements they care about the most. It doesn't mean they aren't justified in their opinion. But because its core mechanics are just so good and it is delivered in such a slick presentation it is more than enough for its fans."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	Was walking my dog. Saw something on sidewalk that looked like part of a circle. Wondered how I can get on neighbors roof for better perspective.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	This review is INSANE! The game looks pretty and I do enjoy some solitude and mystery in a game, but there isnt much mystery after me playing for about 3 hours. The puzzles get VERY boring after doing just 50 of them. So far they are all the same: you guide a line through a maze with each set of mazes having different rules. Some are fun, some are annoying. There isnt much sound going on, there is no real path to take (not yet at least) so you wander around not knowing if you should be solving those puzzles or not (I just try and solve all the ones I can when encountering them), and there seems to be no story. At least you have a run button. I ended up gettin it on sale for 16 bucks. Not worth it. I just bought a game called The Fall for $2.50 and it kicked ass... sci-fi with a great story (even though puzzle solving was a bit tedious and didnt always make sense.) I'd give it a 6 so far and thats just because of how pretty it looks and how they did a decent job constructing the island. It could've been a more Myst like game with a deeper puzzle mechanic. Sorry if Im judging this game too quickly because of my mere 3 hours into it, but after 3 hours it isnt showing me anything new. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	This review is astonishingly well written. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	Oh my god, if you think the puzzles are boring and unvaried, wait until you find the little recorded voice messages scattered around the island. Do yourself a favor and don't click on them, unless you want to hear several minutes of un-skippable pseudo-spiritual, new-age crap that was written by some a-hole who took World Religions 101 at the local junior college and turned Bahai because he liked everything he heard. Those recordings turn this from an okay game to a downright insulting pile of garbage
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	"@anarchonobody I don't think Augustine of Hippo, Rabindranath Tagore or Albert Einstein constitute ""new-age crap"". These are some of the greatest poets and philosophers in human history speaking alongside the our most brilliant scientific minds. Maybe spend a bit more time listening to the logs, rather than bashing them on the internet."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	"I just finished the game and now I clearly see this review doing advertising for this game...and this is FALSE advertising. ""is a game brimming with secrets: daunting and multilayered mysteries "" ...there is NO mystery here, no story, no answers to anything...no nothing. I won't spoil the ending, but dont expect to solve ""mysteries"" of the island or all the fascinating things that the advertiser of this review want to convince us about. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	I wholeheartedly agree with everyone's dumbfoundedness of the 10/10 score of this game. It is a GOOD game, no doubt, but it isn't the BEST... not even the best puzzle game. Full disclosure, I LOVE puzzle games. I grew up on Myst and the 7th Guest... this game pales in comparison to those greats. It is certainly a beautiful game, but the puzzles are incredibly unvaried... the same puzzle with different rules is still the same puzzle. And there is almost non-existent sound in this game, aside from footsteps and an annoying buzzing sound when you try to solve a puzzle. If you're on the fence about buying this game, here's the premise: Imagine never seeing Sudoku before in your life, then you're thrown on an island, and the only way off is to solve an entire book of Sudoku...only thing is, you're not given any instructions or hints. That's the entire difficulty in this game... figuring out what you're supposed to do... once each puzzle's gimmick is found, then it's just tedium of solving the same type of puzzle 30 times.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	Puzzles are amazing and mind expanding, but fall flat ultimately because of the disappointing world building and story telling. You can't just keep rewarding puzzles with more puzzles, there needs to be something more. It's just a world full of quotes and simplified philosophies. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	Gotta force relevancy of this mediocre puzzle game! Game of the Year LOL I guess you got some of that money from its insultingly inflated price tag.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/25/the-witness-review	I think what IGN means is: for a puzzle/mystery game it is a 10/10. Those of you who don't play these type of titles...just stay away lol

Defenitely not! The tester just didn't manage to work out a proper strategy. For my taste it's actually way too EASY! All in all I played just 75 Minutes until I finished the game on hard with all crew surviving and a 1700er score. There was no luck involved, I had throws like 4 times 3 with 5 dice when 3 causes injury. 
Watched a couple of let's play videos before but even without that it's really not too difficult.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review	"I'm not going to say it's an amazing game. But it isn't getting fair reviews simply because it is hard and not hand holding. Yes, it's a permadeath roguelike with punishing mechanics. No, it's not out of your hands - at least on the normal difficulty, you can win with near certainty if you play right. 

I wish you carebears would just move on and let people with some grit review a game  rather than crying about things being too hard."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review	I bought this game last week. I regret wasting my money. It is impossible to win.I played the regular game about 50 times, could not win a single time. Problems: All my crew take 2 or 3 health damage on every health damage event, even though the event only lists 1 health damage.Passing through an event area lists as giving 1 damage, they always give 2 damage. Every turn I get a minimum of 2 events (usually 3) with 18 to 28 fix points for each one. About once every 3rd game play I get an event with 250 fix points. Die rolling does not calculate correctly. If my crew member shows having 1 die, then they roll 1 die. If my crew member shows having 2 dice, then they roll 1 die. If my crew member shows having 3 dice, then they roll 2 dice. If my crew member shows having 4 dice, then they roll 3 dice. If my crew member shows having 5 dice, then they roll 3 dice. They never roll the number of dice shown. I cannot count how many times the roll of the dice has totalled 1 point less than what is needed to complete the fix, at least 50% or more of the time this happens. Statistically impossible. I Love the Burning Mission: You start out with a ship with 8 HP (modules) and 4 crew. At the start all 8 modules are on fire, so you can save 4 of them at most. OK, did that, lost 4 HP, got 4 left, and 4 modules burning. New event, the 4 modules I had saved are now all burning again. So now I have 4 HP, 4 crew and 8 burning modules. Impossible.This could have been a great game, very original. But it just does not work.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review	I came here because of game scoop, I also checked out the game... there actually is skill involved and you can win every time as @Answulf pointed out, a shame someone's ignorance generated a terrible review of an otherwise decent rogue-like.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/20/tharsis-review	"So the entire premise of this review is that ""you that you don't have control over its interstellar disaster, just the illusion of it.""  However, one player on YouTube (Dragondave17) has now won 30+ games in a row and posted them online - completely discrediting Rob's primary critiques of the game.

I am a huge fan of the podcast hosted by Rob Zacny, Three Moves Ahead.  However, this review is one of his worst and not indicative of the time, effort or thought that goes into his show.  It's fine if he didn't enjoy the game, but to trash it for being too random when it was instead a failure of Rob's ability to understand how to do well at the game is more worthy of a nerd rage message board post than an IGN review from an industry veteran.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	Strange review. Reviewer (Jose) said he did not like inventory management (big and important part of RE classics) back in 2002, and now expected that to be gone, thus reducing final points because of it? Are you for fucking real Jose? Why play a HD remastered game that you already were not fond of once it originally came out? What did you expect? Unlimited inventory slots? In a RE classic? You for fucking real?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	@phili878 This is why we can't take IGN Reviews seriously.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	Read the 2002 game review for GameCube. It says the story is amazing. How can the story be amazing one year and a negative the next? If I read a book in 2002 and reread the book a few years later, it's the same damn story I enjoyed years back.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	6.5??????? Gtfo. Keep shitting on quality games and giving top scores to the cookie cutter yearly releases. I played this for first time recently and it's one of the beat sp gaming experiences I've had in ages.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	If somethig gets a bad score on ign, i always come to the comments to see if people disagree.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	I really, really love how much everyone hates this review (:
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	Here is why i do not take major reviews seriously anymore, went into great detail on what he thought were negatives but did very little talking on the vast amounts of positives, and giving the game a very misleading score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	"I love how this reviewer can give a REMASTER a bad grade for not being a remake, but when I give him a bad review, ign deletes my opinion. I didn't curse or swear.
Re0, along with re2 is one of my favorite Re games. Therefore, I wl defend it when someone bashes it. It makes me upset that ign would let such a low score go out for a great game, and that they would DELETE my opinion in their community comments. I guess they don't want their gamers to have a voice.
Resident Evil 0 uses the old school formula, so don't expecting raging action or zombies with Mp4s in this one. Its more about exploration, ammo conservation, atmosphere and puzzles. Kids now days might not have the patience for this type of game (ign staff included).
The train section is amazing and the overall ambience is creepy and well done. The inventory system is the only negative thing I have to say about the original design. They were trying to make it more realistic but it gets cumbersome having to set things on the floor all the time, then search for it later, and sometimes it gets stuck in a weirs camera angle. It doesn't take too much away. It's still my 2nd favorite and an easy 9/10."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	@TWalls27 Agreed I really enjoyed Resident Evil Zero on the Wii when I played it about 5 years back and Im playing it again on the PC.  Solid Game I dont get the hate.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	Jose I review you 4/10. Dont be fool by this review. If you like Resident evil 1 remake and the resident evil 0 from GC you will like this game. Is the same version with some improvements. This game is a old classic, with the old formula, and is much better then RE 5 and 6. If you love survival horror games and like resident evil you should buy it, and you are a long time fan from the franchise you will love it! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/18/resident-evil-zero-hd-remaster-review	If this was a Wii U exclusive game, Jose woulda given it 9/10, and Im not joking. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	do you think someone could make Minecraft graphics using only their wang?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	Should have gotten less than a 5. Telltale, please come up with an original concept and stop milking other people's franchises.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@Employee427 An original concept is welcome, but Telltale gives different angles to well establish franchises that are just as welcome (But I agree with you about Mine-craft, giving it a story mode is just bizarre) 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	This is a very disappointing review from ign. I came here and expected a detailed review about episode 4, covering all the parts of the story in full detail, especially this is the longest episode telltale has released on minecraft story mode. And what do I get? A 1 minute read that hardly even goes into detail. It skims over many plot points, dismissing the story of the order section in a paragraph, dismissing the far lands in another, and not even touching on how the puzzles are a lot more complicated, and how great character moments between Gabriel/Petra, Ivor, Olivia and Axel are a lot more refined. This review seems to be very rushed, as if the reviewer just noticed he had to do minecraft story mode episode 4, was tired of the game, and just decided to look at the negative bits. I mean, seriously. If you have to give a negative review, at least go into a bit of detail. Episode 2's failure was described brilliantly in the episode 2 review. And this? This just shows the utter bias the reviewer has. For once, I actually reccomend not looking at this ign review, because it is so lazy it didn't go into any plot details and skimmed over a lot of good points, only showing the bad. I can easily conclude the reviewer is just bored of the game and pumped out a review quick because he couldn't be bothered to make a proper one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	This review seems biased.  Other sites have given episode four a consistent 4/5 or 8/10, and from what I played I would agree.  I think maybe this particular reviewer just doesn't like the game -- which to me isn't the same as it being objectively a 6/10.  I liked this episode a lot and it actually brought up the whole series for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@dbrght this game has a Metacritic score of 72, 68 and 71 across PS4, PC and X1. Its scores are pretty mediocore and there are other sites that are giving it the same or lower than what IGN has
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@Havok-x83 @dbrght  No, IGN's score is at or near the very bottom of the list on Metacritic.  (Anyone reading this can see for themselves with a couple clicks.)  The reviewer seems to have a different take on this episode than the majority of people who have played it -- guessing he just doesn't like the series.  It's obviously no Walking Dead, but if you take it on its own terms it's quite enjoyable, and this episode (I felt) wrapped things up in a really fun and satisfying way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	The reviewer was very lazy in this review. He didn't even go into detail on plot points, merely skimming over a lot of stuff.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@dbrght There is no such thing as an objective review

http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	I think I liked this episode better than the rest so far. The score has taken a jump in quality, for instance, as old themes like Ivor's and the Wither Storm get extra layers. Pee Wee Herman as Ivor makes the best of what he's given, and Dee Bradley Baker as Rueben The Pig is perfect as ever.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	One thing I've noticed is that the penultimate episode is consistently the weakest in Telltale's games.  I think they fall into a trap of saving the good stuff for the last episode so they can go out with a bang, but they end up saving too much for the finale. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@Greed1914 This kinda IS the finale. They've got one episode left, and we're in the dark on what it contains.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	 Tales from the Borderlands is still probably the best of Telltale's recent output. It left me feeling so much more invested in Pandora and that universe than any of the 'proper' Borderlands games ever did.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@Kmadden2008 And yet Telltale took the stupid route and decided to make a 2nd season to GoT raher than to this :( I just hope the events and characters established in Tales from the Borderlands will be in Borderlands 3. Too much has happened for them not to be  part of the next game now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	"@Artyjack96 @Kmadden2008 In all fairness, I don't think Tales of the Borderlands: Season 2 is necessarily Telltale's decision to make, they'd probably also need 2K Games and Gearbox to sign off on it too.

And if, hypothetically, they're already working on Borderlands 3, then that would probably have to factor into when Tales: Season 2 could/should be released.

But, yeah, it would be nice to see a Borderlands 3 pick up on some of the characters and loose threads left from Tales."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@Kmadden2008 @Artyjack96 I'd rather they stick to the Tales games, because it'd be a waste to have them standing around dispensing quests and subpar dialogue not written by Telltale.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	These Telltale games are just lazily produced. Cheap terrible game engine that they have used for a decade. They have completely gotten rid of any puzzle solving elements in order to have a faster turn around in production. These games have devolved in to pop up story books with a hint of choice that has no consequence to the overall story as everyone just just comes to the same ending. Telltale had a promising start with The Walking Dead season 1 where it had a small puzzle element that they could have expanded upon. Except they chose the lazy route and abandoned it altogether. Shame on them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@DribblesBarbax I think it depends on the game, but this one is aimed more at the kids than the M rated TWD players..  I never expected much from this game though, adding a story to a game that has none except what you make of it is an odd thing to do.. Its why Doom 1 and 2 are better than Doom 3, you knew the mission in the first 2 games,  just kill stuff and collect keys.. Then number 3 came along removed everything that was fun, added story and said we haz grphx!!.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@DribblesBarbax This whole game is absurd gutter trash with no value to speak of. The price they ask for this turd is offensive.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	"People must really be desperate to enjoy these episodic adventure games that get away with filling 2-3 episodes a season with low content, minimal gameplay that scores in in the 5-6.0 region, games Telltale so expertly have specialized themselves in. 
This episodic format have ruined the adventure/point n click genre imo, instead of getting this huge well done beautiful game like Day of the Tentacle or Grim Fandango you will look back on and remember as a gem we are instead getting these half arsed forgettable 4-5 episode a season games where most of them score in the average range and are forgotten as soon as you have played it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@TheGamerPandA Telltale have had some great games though. That can't be taken away from them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@Jack_Stripper @TheGamerPandA I personally didnt enjoy the episodic format after Sam and Max season 2. That one was really well done. It was still short/easily accessible like the newer telltale games but still had a great amount of puzzles & gameplay but Walkign Dead season 1 was a huge letdown to me. There was some interesting parts of episode 2 and 4 but the gameplay is nowhere to be found and the story was a worse version of the tv show to me. I havent played anything from the after that. Wallace & Gromit was also well done imo, they just went the easy way with easier accesible adventure games after that for people with no patience.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@TheGamerPandA Play Badge of Carnage if you didn't - it's f-ing awesome and classic point and click.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@TheGamerPandA @Jack_Stripper I feel sorry for anyone who wants to check out Wallace & Gromit, considering it's been taken down due to the license running out. We previous owners can still redownload it, but otherwise it's a shame it wasn't more popular.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@magicemperor @TheGamerPandA @Jack_Stripper Ye the same fate with Bone, i love the comics but never got around for the game due to it abruptly stopping i think. Wallace and Gromit was really well executed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@TheGamerPandA I agree, these games are god awful with virtually zero gameplay. So fucking SHIT.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	@TheGamerPandA ruined? It helped revitalize it. These type of games were virtually nonexistant or at a low pointfor quite some time until a resurgence the middle of last gen with Heavy Rain and then TWD by TTG
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/14/minecraft-story-mode-episode-4-a-block-and-a-hard-place-review	Satisfying Climax, oh yeses
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	They really need to release these games on Vita. BF is still the best AC game out there though Syndicate aint bad but it needs the traversal refined. Especially downwards
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@boucho11 they are coming to vita in april I think. Too little too late IMO but they ARE coming. I think I will wait until then anyways. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	They need to stop making the AC games like this it fucking degrates us all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	Didnt know that an Assassin's  Creed China was made, thats dissappointing. A game built in a Chinese era, would've been up there with Black Flag just have some intense boss battles that this series tend to lack. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	"Im still only at 16% sync of AC3 lol, the backlog alone for the AC games is unreachable at this point.

And what a waste, this is a location that deserved a fully fledged AC game instead of boring England. Riding elephants through a bazaar and trampling everyone would have been a blast."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@TheGamerPandA I didn't find England any more boring than the endless trees and fields of AC3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	"@cnnryng @TheGamerPandA Ye the trees and fields have already taken the toll on me im now at 38% sync after 18 hours and its really a damn chore. Im so glad i discovered the naval/ship missions though. Each time i play the game for about 3-4 hour sessions i always give myself a treat with 1 or 2 of those missions to end the game with, they are so damn fun. I wish they would make a game dedicated to this part of the game tbh at this point. Ive already given up collecting the stuff the only thing i do is get the viewpoints and doing stuff that has missions. Even the viewpoint part sucks in this game though tbh, in the older games climbing viewpoints was like a puzzle in themselves now its just climbing straight up lol.

I really miss the ""painting"" puzzles of AC2 though, i have no idea why they went away from that, it really added to the mysterious atmopshere of the games plot and gave a eerie/illuminati feeling of some sort. Now its basically just missions and collecting stuff atleast in AC3 that is."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@TheGamerPandA @cnnryng if playing the game is a total chore than why are you playing it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@TheGamerPandA @cnnryng Heard of Black Flag? Pretty much that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@TheGamerPandA Syndicate is awesome and so is London, I find it hard to believe that any fan of the series would disagree, you must not have actually played it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	The AC breasts are all shriveled, but they still milkin'.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	If there are breasts presents , babies shall milk.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@asdfggg Oh yeah, sure, absolutely.  Because, you know, like, tens of thousands of years of human history have TOTALLY been tapped dry over the course of ten games, a few spinoffs and some comics and novels.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	These places should be full realized worlds on consoles smh.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	damn they sure milk this crappy franchise for all its worth
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	Woah! I've never seen these games. They look a bit like the old Prince of Persia games. Am I wrong?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@beastie01 Assassin's Creed is the spiritual successor to Prince of Persia, especially these Chronicles games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@Rev8691 @beastie01 I knew that, but always assumed it was a successor to the Sands of Time and after PoP games. I'm going to be looking into these 2D games. I was a HUGE fan of the old PC PoP games and still keep my fingers crossed for a third one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	@beastie01 @Rev8691 The Chronicles games are frustrating but pretty enjoyable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	Just give this AC spinoff to Michel Ancel, he will do it right.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/12/assassins-creed-chronicles-india-review	Ubisoft wasting an awesome place to make an full fledged AC game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	This game is awesome I played It and I kill about 20 cars XD
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	"I think it does what it does fairly competently.I've had worse games through my ps+ sub.

Incidentally  , shouldn't 5.5 out of 10 be slightly above average , mediocre more like 3 ?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	"SInce the update, there are tons of more game modes. 
Also it being free makes this game an easy 8/10 for me.
7/10 if you buy it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	I thought this was a PS4 vs Xbox One debate article.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	Imo I thought this game was complete shit, I think a 5.5 is being a bit generous.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	"""Clunky controls"" - No, you guys just don't understand how to adapt. The were clunky for me the first match. After that, I got the hang of it. It's a video game, learn to adapt to what the dev wants you to play ass. All that whining made them make ""easy"" controls which disables the turret rotation. Happy noobs? 

""Flat audio"" Get a better TV that wasn't given to you guys as a bribe, maybe? 

""Little variety"" They add 2 game modes every day? And cycle through ones? 

""Weak progression"" Get better? 

This game deserves better attention. It's fast, easy.

If you enjoy World of Tanks or like Rocket League, then you'll probably enjoy this one too. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	Well I liked it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	i played the beta and it was like World of tanks animated with bad controls
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	"Played the beta and i've added this to my library but i don't ever see me downloading and playing it. 
Playing the beta showed me that this really does have zero to offer, its bland as hell and has nothing to elevate it any further. You've seen all it has to offer by your first death."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/11/hardware-rivals-review	This review was a bit harsh, to be honest.  I actually really liked the game, it just needs a little bit of fine tuning.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	"""Amplitude of 2016 isn't as good as Amplitude of 2003"" That's a pretty fair indictment of gaming in general these days. Not as good as it used to be because it lacks depth. 

Regards to Amplitude, I was looking forward to this, but if they couldn't re-release the same tracks or get different songs from the same artists or other big names then why even bother?! 

The minute I heard ""mostly in house electronica"" I knew they had blown it. In a game like this the soundtrack quality is it's life and soul. Harmonix of all people should know that. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	Is there any chance of this coming to PC?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	It seems like Harmonix just hasn't been able to get the same artists they used to be able to get, and even though they are great developers music games without good/popular music will never do as well as the game that does have the licenses.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	Have to agree with this and I helped back it on Kickstarter. 7/10. I'd rather play the original Amplitude than this version. The soundtrack just doesn't have enough variety. There are a couple of songs I actually do love, but not anywhere near how good the first one was. Its still fun though, and I think if you've never tried the original you could probably get hooked on this one since you don't have anything prior to look at.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	I agree that all the songs just kind of blur into one long song, they're all the same as apposed to the older version where you had a mixture.  I was hoping that if you beat the game, or, for every song you beat on expert or something they would give you one of the old songs too.  But alas. Still fun, still hurts my hands. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	I haven't heard all the songs yet but they're actually really good IMO. Recession still remains the best one, even after I discovered it in RB4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	is it just me or is there no pad beat vibration, that's weak if there isnt
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	"Howwwww is nobody complaining about the lack of Remix mode?
Remix mode was so amazing on the PS2. Remixing online with your friends and then playing the songs with people.
Like the best part of the game is just gone...

Props to IGN for mentioning it. None of the other review sites do haha"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	Those were some of the best memories I had playing this game. Wondering if there's a chance of us ever getting some online mode, additional songs, or remix mode in the future
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	This review is, unfortunately, spot-on.  I absolutely loved the original and it is, and has been, the only game I go back to the PS2 to play.  I too love the Streak Seek function but the lack of any sort of musical variety is what makes this game basically boring to me.  The remix function of the original was also very enjoyable but being absent in this version doesn't bother me but only because I'd have no interest in remixing the included tracks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/07/amplitude-review	Just download demo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	Nintendo ripping off sony huh. at best this is wipeout ripoff at worst its half ass f zero
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@lancevance76 Nintendo did not develop the game. Nice try.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	"OH good lawwwd!!! Who's complaining about this game at $15. 
If nintendo's name was directly on this people would be blowing them below the belt about how great this release is. 
Play the game and enjoy! "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	"@RupanSensae  Actually, if Nintendo's name were on it we'd be complaining about lack of multiplayer, Amiibo something-something, lack of ""content"", and then we'd be hearing about how terrible some unrelated game is and how the Wii U hasn't sold any units...blah blah blah..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@CyberEarl @RupanSensae But Nintendo hasn't sold any units...or is still in a game drought. This was reviewed on 1/4/16 and there has been little else to cover (hence the reason this is still a main article on the Wii U site). Wii U blows and Nintendo does for treating their customers like ATM machines.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	At the end of the race right before you win a few racers always boost past you. Also, I don't want to be forced to collect every orb and switch polarity perfectly to win. FZero never did that. In F-Zero GX you could win by being a good RACER, not by gimmics that are more of a distraction than fun
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	Are there any weapons? If there's no missiles or machine guns/lasers to wear down opponents vehicles, it might not have much interest.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	"@colbtron
It's all about skill and memorization with this game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@abHS4L88 @colbtron As opposed to improvisation and creativity? Shame.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	"@colbtron
The game's boosting mechanics is creative enough. Adding in weapons would make the game too crazy and erratic. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@colbtron @abHS4L88 Yeah, you're right. Still, you can't knock a racing game for being a racing game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	I get that this a  spiritual successor to F-Zero, but really it plays and looks like the 2008 game Wipeout HD for the PS3. That's not a diss because Wipeout HD was a great for it's time, but this doesn't feel as fresh to me because of that game. For the price it's worth checking out if you've never played Wipeout HD, but I am just a little disappointed at how much Fast Racing Neo copied from it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@Last_Poster The thing is how many other games have come out within the last 10 years that have this style?  F-Zero GX came out in 2003, Wipeout HD came out in '08 (as you said)...and that's about it, actually.  Fast Racing Neo feels like a breath of fresh air in a genre filled with either games that want to be Fast and Furious (I.E. N4S and it's contemporaries) or strict Car-sim games (Project C.A.R.S. [ which I honestly quite liked even though I'm not a car fanatic], GRID and others) and then you get the occasional cartoon Kart Racer I.E. Mario Kart 8 or Sonic & All Stars Racing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	"This is a great game for a small price.
Don´t feel intimidated by the difficulty level. Actually, the game is not so hard as the reviewer says. The game is just about memorization and as soon as you get used to the courses layout,  it will fell a lot more easier. The A.I. doesn´t change much in therms of challenge or agressiveness from one cup to another, what really changes is the speed of the cars, it gets tough to handle then, but the average player will breeze throught the subsonic league and spent a little more time on supersonic league
Go for it if you like racers"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	"@Rogerioandrade What do you think it could have sold for? 
If Nintendo bought it, full fare ofcourse. I'd love a retail release of this for posterity. Hoping it comes out for $30 retail, i would buy that. Gonna keep holding out a couple more months. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	Nintendo NX will release FZero on their very own VR. That'd be great wouldn't it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@icer_zerocool I think I'm going to vomit just thinking about it. :P
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@JKB06 XD
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	Fun fact: F-zero 64 was on of the few N64 games that ran at 60 fps.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	Interesting, honestly didn't know that. Man I love(d) that game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	Nintendo should have slapped FZero on a box and release it with more features, it would have sold well. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	"@PreZZ_00
You do realize that F-Zero was never really a strong seller right? That's one of the reasons why Nintendo's been apprehensive with bringing out a new title."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	@abHS4L88 @PreZZ_00 Considering they didn't even develop F-ZERO GX either. I think it would be their first since Fzero N64, but I cannot confirm it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review	The vehicles are definitely NOT too samey. Go to more advanced speeds and you'll feel the difference in handling, acceleration, and top speed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	Just picked it up on X1, only played for about 30 minutes. A gorgeous racer, it is tough but if you are willing to focus in and learn the physics, the experience is very rewarding.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	"""To be honest I’m not certain what it is about this corner in particular that warrants the added advice""  Most likely referencing P.Solberg's massive crash after hitting a hinkelstein (the half-buried stones)...

https://youtu.be/s-_PyovawYQ"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	"Exercise in frustration.  Skyviolet is somewhat right about the game play dynamics.  The car will snap this way and that way again and again in a very unnatural way.And, like stated, its when you’re on the gas, in a turn, near the edge of the road or the effin’ breeze blows and suddenly you are snapping the wheel from side to side to try to recover.I've had the game (on Xbox One) for almost 2 months now and it's made me so mad several times I’ve debated spiking my controller in frustration.  And seeing the replies they got, I live in Michigan and have been driving rear wheel, front wheel and all wheel drive cars for 31 years in this crap we call the 4 seasons.  And I've been playing rally games since Sega Rally Championship. 
Some of this game is very, very good.  It does demand you are 100% all the time.  If not, you're screwed.  It wouldn't take much for the developers to ease up on the game play.  Easy mode?  Maybe.  How about a ""not drive you bat crap crazy mode""?Right now, even after tweaking the car for each track so long that you could have been done with that race already and the thing is only marginally better.Can I pull out a win or a decent victory?Yes but the stars, moon and planets all need to align just right or forget about it.
Could have been a superb game.Best advise I can give you is that if you want it… find it used."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	@billyxbox I've been playing for a few weeks ago, and have learned that it's all about nuanced control & response, very slight movements of the thumbstick.  I've read that using a wheel makes the game much more controllable (therefore enjoyable).  I may have to pick one up, maybe if we have any leftover fun money from tax refund...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	Again, and I've been saying this for nearly 2 decades now and everyone is still getting it WRONG.. cars don't drive like this. Do any of these programmers have an actual driver's license. I live in the snow, I've been in the desert, I know this. It is scientifically IMPOSSIBLE for a moving vehicle of any weight over 200lbs to be flipping and flapping all over the place like it is made out of tin foil, and a feather for a motor, and glass tires... The worst part, and I've been telling these idiots for so many years STOP MAKING THESE VEHICLES BE ASS DRIVEN!!! It is annoying and physically unneccessary that any slight turn or bump miraculously sends the ass to the front, not even a complete spin, just straight up like there is always a huge magnet on the rear and it is drawn by the view in front (it should act like a larger magnet is subliminally 3 feet in front of the car). Anybody with a 3rd grade science education and the science behind why 2 wheel vehicles staying afloat in motion... You ALWAYS continue in forward motion while in forward motion... Let's just make it easier and say it should be IMPOSSIBLE for the car to spin it's rear to the front in forward motion, so you damn well know that spinning out every 5 seconds is just plain the programming of a COMPLETE ASSHOLE IDIOT!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	@skyviolet sounds like you have never driven a rear wheel drive car with power. or you just suck at racing games...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	The stupidest thing I'll read all day. You don't know much about cars, do you?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	@skyviolet Sounds like you should have started with the Lancia Fulvia FWD.  I just started a new career, and am loving this car.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	@skyviolet Your a special kind of stupid. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	The age of too much simulation but still delivering it with an outdated premise and with so many flaws is unnacceptible and is the furthest thing away from fun EVER!! You know what people want?? They want EA to make Burnout Rally !!! They want road rage on the open field, they want crash over the hills and canyons, they want eliminator race through the african desert, south american jungles, asian rice fields, northern american snow, waterfalls, italian villas and arab war torn lands... they want speed, they want arcade, they want an endless random generating track mode. This shit should have happened more than ten years ago and these idiots would rather put out shit like this??? I should be a trillionaire by now!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	"R U kidding me?? IGN must get paid to try to sell such garbage. They should rename this game ""Cliff Fall"" because every goddamn track is on a cliff! And guess what? You are falling off of them every minute... I can understand once in a blue moon rallying on cliffs, but nothing but cliffs, nobody likes that. The programmers should be slapped to death, it's like saying give us your money now go jump off a cliff! The coloring might be nice, but I think the graphics suck. The trees look cookie cutter scattered and cloned. You get close to them and they look like they are made out of paper. The views are horrible, the hood and window view feels more like the driver seat and the cockpit view feels like your in the back seat. Both give no sense of side and you tend to hit walls even when it feels like your in the center of the narrow road. If I get stuck against a wall (happens alot because the brakes are useless) I barely hit reverse and the car flies backwards, but to go forward it slowly drags to finally get momentum. Your probably better off driving backwards. Now for my biggest pet peave.... Damn damage, I hate simulations, what ever happened to more fun, arcade type rally? Does anybody make those anymore? Why are the annoying windshield wipers going on at odd times over my cracked windshield (that never gets repaired) when it's a clear ass day??? Why is there only one co-driver voice, and of course it has to be the most annoying and drull thing ever!!! Remember 20 years ago when you could choose languages, girl or guy variants and they didn't put you to sleep..(colin mcrae anyone?) Why in the year 2016 is this driving game the most linear and narrow roaded short tracks? And again on the edge of cliffs... This game is a nightmare!!!! I would give it a 2...and fire everybody who designed it!!! Oh and fix the damn track reset button, it should ALWAYS be available, I got stuck and it took nearly 6 minutes before it was made ready... Now that is bullshit!!!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	"@skyviolet LoL.  Started playing this a few weeks ago.  Yes, it is difficult to master, but I love the challenge & experience. Finland was amazing, how thrilling to blast down those flowing stages, right on the edge of control & crashing...

Speaking of Finland.  No cliffs there, not sure what you are talking about.  No cliffs in Sweden & Germany either.  A few in Wales, but moreso steep downhills.  That leaves Greece, Monaco & Pikes Peak.  Yes, there are cliffs there, just like in real life...

I enjoy the cockpit view, gives me more control & sense of stage position then I thought it would.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	interesting game, altho part way through i couldnt handle the keyboard anymore (and was told i had to have a wheel), and the community is one of the most blood thirsty fanboi's ive ever seen in my life that dont really have much substance behind them.  Oh well guess ill go play with the real rally car lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	"To be honest, this game is entirely too realistic, I mean I understand the time penalties and stuff but you know what? It doesn't need to be on a dang game, I mean I drive flawlessly just to barely keep up with 3rd place in RX. There needs to be at least a difficulty setting where it dumbs down the A.I.s just a little. Ever since I bought this game I've been aggravated as can be. I'm a very decent driver and this game puts me to shame, codemasters, you are no longer getting my business,
And as far as those of you who like to comment things like I suck and you just need to get better, I also don't play this game day in and day out 24/7. So get a life."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	Just picked up this game today. If anyone has any recommendations for what wheel set-up I should get for my PS4, it would be greatly appreciated. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/21/dirt-rally-review	"For it's console price there are just not enough tracks sadly. I feel lucky i paid $20 odd for it back in early access on PC. It's lost a lot of the detail compared to PC maxed out running at 144 fps in 1440p but i guess that is to be expected. At least they did manage to get it running at 60 fps.
I am hoping they add quite alot more track selections in future updates for both PC and console though as it's hard to justify more than a budget price for what is currently there."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	Looks badass. Have only played Xenoblade on the 3DS, but so far have liked it. So I'll for sure give this game a try. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	"This game was fantastic and I loved every second of it's story. I did have some problems with it and I want to know if anyone else was bugged by this. Feel free to vent.

1.) The item system was nightmare inducing. You can hold 999 of any type of item but can't sort them to save your life, specifically armor. You can only sell them 1 at a time, and usually a lot of the same ones to sell. You also can't mark items so you don't accidentally sell one you like in a list of 40 of that same item. I also found myself constantly forgetting I had good enhancements on gear and ended up rediscovering them when I was selling armor.

2.) The pre-rendering on the game is very bad. I actually thought nothing of it until I downloaded the 2 GB worth of extra data to help models load faster. I learned that this was a lie and didn't help anything. I still found myself shoved out of cars spawning on top of me after standing still for 15 seconds. 

The biggest problem I had with this one was the enemies. Having a pack of enemies spawn on top of me in a spot thought was safe infuriated me to no end.

3.) The character expressions in the game were static. Too static. I normally have no problem with this, but when someone gives a big motivational speech and everyone is staring off into the void, I felt like I was watching a puppet show."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	Dear lord...finally got around to completing the main story. Great game. Ain't perfect, but the sheer depth and scope is amazing. I would love a sequel to cover those loose threads at the end. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@wizardninja  Xenoblade 2 coming on the Switch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@hardknoc @wizardninja Excited for that, but it's not actually a sequel to X.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@wizardninja @hardknoc  Yes. I understand. 2 is a sequel to the original and is not a true sequel to X just as X is not a true sequel to the original.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@hardknoc @wizardninja Right. Hopefully we will get a sequel to X someday! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	Game will go down in history as one of the greats, no doubt. The quality and scale is beyond anything i've ever seen. And my god, don't get me started on the depth. The learning curve is pretty grand here.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@FaceLessManNo1 honestly my concern is that it won't go down as one of the greats but should be since it didn't get a proper review, and not enough WII Users! !  This game was massive, depth, customization, and frankly the best open world game I have played YTD!!  I wished more people had the chance to play this game since most people don't own a WI-U!  The Wii-U purchase alone was worth this game!  And frankly disgusted since IGN critic- Jose gave it a horrible review!  I hope the users will find comfort and remember this game as one of the best JRPG classics!  I can't trust IGN reviews and go to other websites now.. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@gq_foine @FaceLessManNo1 very true, game was severely underrated. same thing happened with resonance of fate. ign took a shit on that game too for some reason. it tried something out the box and had huge customization, just like xenoblade chronicles x. both resonance of fate and xenoblade x will stay in my memory forever. that's all that matters. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@gq_foine @FaceLessManNo1 well, they should PORT their games to other platforms. but they cant...so heaps of people will never play it. Me included. I just wont buy a console for 1 game or 2 games. Waste of money.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@FaceLessManNo1 Without a doubt. It might have a resurgence if remastered on NX.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	Hands down x is the best game released this gen in my opinion. The game is neverending. It's awesome that it's a wii u exclusive but I kind of wish it was on the ps4 and Xbox one only because i believe it would receive the credit it deserves. Monado deserves an hd remake and both games would sell a lot of wii us if monolith had released a similar game on the ps4. I got a mass effect vibe from x and Monado is so different that they are really two different games in the same series. They remind me of psone, ps2 era final fantasy games and I believe if the wii version would have been released on the ps2 it would definitely be hailed as one of the greatest games ever made. I sometimes wonder what would have happened if the wii would have went head to head with the ps2. If launched at the same time with Nintendo emphasizing motion controls while allowing third parties to do whatever they wished, Nintendo could have very well knocked Microsoft and Sony out of the game. Nintendo won last gen with a ps2 competitor and the present landscape could have been drastically altered.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	Just finished the story and oh my god... I love this game so much! I love how just when you think you know what's going on, a plot twist comes up and changes your understanding of the situation completely. Really a masterpiece!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@ingredients1 Best JRPG of this gen!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	"This is at least 9!! This game is in my top 10 best JRPG ever!!! Yes they could tweak a few things - sound through cut scenes, louder voice, and improved story/ characters but I haven't been this excited to get and play my SKELL since trying to find out who the murder is in Persona 4 Golden!!! I think this is most Amazing game!!!! Looking forward to the next Xenoblade!!!!!!
Metacritic gave this game average USER's score 9 (over 1,260+ users) and Critics average 8.4.  THIS WII U GAME IS IN THE TOP 10! In FACT IGN ITALY GAVE THEM 9.5 and IGN SPAIN 9.2!! BUT  Jose Otero (IGN USA) gave this game @ 8.2, which lower than MOST of the critics and Much lower than the 1,260+ users SCORE!! You all do the math and Jose is NOT a true gamer at all and he doesn't know anything about JRPG! (Nintendo poser)
This is at least 9+ period!!  I am disgusted at his REVIEWS! And how IGN ITALY AND IGN SPAIN MARKED THEIR SCORE 10 points higher. Jose reviews are complete GARBAGE - full STOP!!!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@gq_foine Yeah, definitely a classic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	I think this game  is a really good game as it is but in my opinion I really wish this was going to be a sequel to chronicles with Shulk. And yes I do like chronicles more...here's why, For one the story and plot  in chronicles is a lot more creative and tell its own story better than X. 2....  lets talk about the story, An Alien war is coming to earth and so the human race is forced to evacuate earth though unfortunately  only 1 and only ship containing Los angeles managed to escape   and then while  fighting off the alien army it eventually was too much for the only 1 ship remaining and then so miraculously it landed on a random planet out of nowhere  and yeah thats the intro story.......its ok I suppose but IMO chronicles story Eats this one ...seriously. Ok i'm done talking about the story. The battle system is similar to chronicles also which is good. Its a much  bigger world to explore which is awesome too. Skells are amazing though they take a while to get in the game. To me though the characters aren't that interesting as chronicles eather. In the end the game is fun and overall and is  a very good looking game but personally I like chronicles  more....in my opinion Chronicles story demolishes Xs story.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	@simonthomas6 Monolith Soft said the goal of the game was not to be story driven. They are doing that for Xenoblade Chronicles NX. That is why there is such a difference between Xenoblade Chronicles and Xenoblade Chronicles X, they are meant to be different experiences.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	MASTERPIECE 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	I love this game. One big problem I have with it however is the inability to adjust game audio. It is really annoying to watch a cutscene and have the background music drown out the dialogue. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/07/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review	"I never thought I'd own a Wii U, but I picked up a used one yesterday after seeing Giant Bomb's 'Quick Look' video on this game. I'm a sucker for open world games, and they presented XCX as a JRPG response to the 'Elder Scrolls' games.

So far I'm only about two hours in (just got to New LA after spending some time figuring out combat mechanics) and like what I see so far. Of course time will tell whether this game was ultimately worth $250 (though I did pick up 'Wind Waker HD' through the eShop, and have my eye on the Mario Builder game..)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	5.9 is bit too low but definitely lower than 7. I am happy to get this game for free on PS4 though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	 Just played some of it for free since Steam let us play it for free for a few days. I guess they fixed the problems talked about in this review because i ran the game at 100-120fps Ultra settings on my PC.. Doesn't seem bad to me.. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	5.9 lmao ign is horrible at reviews
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	"This score does not represent the actual game, you are basing it off of bugs that will be fixed instead of actual gameplay, it's like me ordering food and saying it sucks cause it has no salt, that can be fixed but the food is actually good. This game is very good but you are giving the bad score based on things that are small and will be fixed
-NerdyNikNack"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	@NerdyNikNack If they don't review things this way developers will continue to release unfinished broken games. If the developers won't fight it the reviewers have to.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	Well put!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	We shouldn't have to wait for patches to fix bugs this atrocious. Not like it's a few bad framerate issues. It's game breaking bugs. Should of NEVER made it past the testers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	@ignbastard I agree, don't release a game until it's 100% playable. But IGN needs to stop being bias for AAA games in this matter as well. They give Just Cause 3 a bad review based on bugs, yet Skyrim almost gets a near perfect score even when it was plagued by bugs and game breaking issues. I had to wait 2 years to play Skyrim on the PS3 with all the bugs that it had.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	Despite the bad reviews... I still got the game. It is installing right now and I will decide whether it's good. However, I find most IGN reviews like movie critic reviews. The movies they say suck usually are decent and the ones they rave about tend to be boring or lack luster.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	@FinalFantasy4Lyfe cause they suck .......hope you got the XL edition!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	"This game has been my go-to, switch off, have fun, the kids are asleep game for months now. The scenery and sound track alone make this game beautiful and the game play is fantastic. 

This score does not represent the game properly and Dan seems to have used issues irrelevant to most to critique it badly.
 The load time is very rarely frustrating, and I haven't noticed the performance issues other than the occasional logging out of online. 

Can't recommend this game enough, and I am not someone that writes reviews often. JC4 is one of few games I know I will be out to buy immediately if/when released."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	@D2430 it'll be here one day dont worry
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	Just picked this up on PS4's Black Friday sale for like $15. I know I'm late to the party and perhaps a lot of the problems Dan brought up may have been patched up by now, but I must say, I don't think I've ever disagreed with a score on IGN more than this one. This game is SO FUN!!! It's somewhere in between GTA, Saints Row with a dash of Watchdogs maybe? It is jam packed with stuff to do. I'd actually say the side missions, challenges, and territory battles are more fun than the actual missions! The map is absolutely huge, and exploring it and finding all the little hidden places and trails never gets old. I've been completely obsessed with it since I started playing. If technical issues have not been patched, they are an absolute non issue to me. If they have been patched, I think if any game deserves an updated review, it's this one. Seriously, this game is awesome!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	@toakr Thanks for the review. I picked it up at the same time and now I am just going to play it! Just finished up FF15 and Mafia3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	This is pretty good game on PS4. Patched, it runs perfectly. And it's bit better than JC2, and that game was amazing! Major difference when compared to JC2 is that in JC3 you have to use your brain a bit more so as to figure what you need to do in order to fulfill mission objectives. It is also bit more challenging overall than JC2 was. Recommended to everyone looking for a blast.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	Dan must be using an old computer because I have not had the same problems. As a matter of fact, I seem to be getting killed a lot, especially when reinforcements are called in. I am ready in my attack heli and before I know it I am being shot down. My experiences are just the opposite. I also think he went in biased because he spent so much time slamming it, no time was spend on story, dialogue... and if you notice, he was moving the camera on purpose. It is almost like he was pissed he had to do a review on a bad day. The game is not worth $60, I bought it for $20. I think it's better than GTA5 which got a 10 and it's graphics suck for such a triple A game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	@ddietsch Dan must be playing on an old computer? Did you read the review? This is the review for the PS4 and Xbox One versions of the game. He even put a link in the review for the PC review where he discusses more about the game when it's actually working on PC and not broken on consoles. And maybe he didn't spend much time on Just Cause 3's story and dialogue because Just Cause has never been a story driven game at all. It's not the focus.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	I don't have a single problem with frame rate, even when blowing things up. Also my wait times last 20 seconds, tops. And I don't even play on a Pc, all on Xbox one
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/12/03/just-cause-3-xbox-one-and-playstation-4-review	@Alchemistscoil There probably have been patches since this game released in 2015 that fixed the game somewhat. They don't update reviews for that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	"No More Renown in Solo PvE Modes? What??!!!

This is a comment that started as a post in reply to a video by IceyCat on YouTube. It has since been posted on the Ubisoft forums in one form or another as well. It has to do with a stupid and very frustrating solution that appears Ubisoft will implement soon regarding renown hacking. Instead of warning/banning those who exploit the game or coming up with a ""proper"" design fix, they will eliminate gaining ANY renown in PvE modes (Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt and Situations that are replayed). I am outraged with the proposed solution. Here is my comment.

NOOOOOOO!

Yes, a very FRUSTRATING solution. Yes, there are people who only like Terrorist Hunt. I am a long-time Rainbow 6 gamer. I loved playing Terrorist Hunt in Vegas 2 and got to rank Elite 15. In Siege I only play Solo PvE (especially Lone Wolf Terrorist Hunt) 90% of the time and Co-op Terrorist Hunt with friends I know 10% of the time. I don't like and never play online multiplayer PvP. I am also not a fan of playing with strangers (which often don't have mics or can start team killing). I never have and never will use the hack these 3,000 others have used. So, this change you describe could render this game null and void for me and my friends. Siege has been my favorite go-to FPS on the Xbox One, but if they implement this as you describe I may have to throw it in the garbage. A stupid solution to a design issue exploited by abusers. This game was released broken. I put up with all the nonsense because the game-play was top-notch. It appears that either the dev team is quite small or not willing to invest the time required to properly address design issues properly. As you say... very FRUSTRATING."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	can i get some opinion if this is suitable for 12 or 13 year old boysplease
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	@020863 If you are asking about Mature content, the game has no foul language or sexual themes, earning its M rating from the realistic and visually graphic kill sequences, high-power assault rifles shooting through bodies with blood appearing realistically. It is a military-style shooter. The game requires very creative outside-the-box tactics and team play that younger players may find too difficult. If this player is used to games like Gears of War, Halo, other Tom Clancy titles, then they will enjoy Rainbow Six: Siege.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	Rainbow six seige is the worst game ive played all day and not even joking every game its taking me and all my freinds out of the game and we where all plat and now are all silver thanks seige awfull game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	@siegisbad Sounds like you guys need to get gud?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	Don't read much into the awful 7.9 IGN gave this game. I bought this game 3 months ago...Haven't played any other game since. If you enjoy communicating with teammates, using your brain to win a round instead of running and shooting, then you will love this game. Game is an easy 9.5 for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	Don't buy.  If you are a casual player, you will hate this game.  It has been taken over by smurfs and try hards.  Their ranks will be 20 or 30, but they will get 4 or 5 kills all the time.  You will regret and will hate this game.  Also, the servers and connections are HORRIBLE.  The system will go down, you will get kicked, slow connections...AWFUL, AWFUL, AWFUL!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	they really need to fix the defence being able to come outside, this is a huge issue with everyone in the community and i mean everyone. also the servers have been very laggy but is to be expected because of updates wich i understand but ubisoft need to step there game up, also defence shouldnt be able to come outside cause in real life they would be shot by a sniper lol plz fix this issue. if ubisoft was smart they will fix this cause they will lose alot of customers. ive spent money but not spending another dime until issue is fixed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	@reids0375 10/10, I laughed pretty hard at this comment.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	This review almost made me not buy this game and now i've been playing it for more than a year. Don't know what will make me stop other than crampy fingers...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	Just dropped by to check this salty comment section and how people ripped the game a new one day one and called it trash and now are dick ridding it... cant wait till ghost recon does the same to people
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	@MrJumpman49  The reviews around the web were very short sighted with Siege. As an avid gamer from 30 years, I could easily see the potential for this game, not only for its gameplay, but also because of the structure of the pay system, free maps - surprisingly this was the main gripes of the reviewers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	This should now be rated minimum 9 right now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	@Arsank47  I agree......crazy part was I played It the first couple weeks it was out and I didn't get engaged.....but I went back to it recently and haven't been able to stop playing
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/rainbow-six-siege-review	"The game is fantastic and I love that they're continuing to support/update/add new content instead of jumping straight to a sequel. I wish more games would take that approach in the future. They also do a great job at balancing the operators and making previously lame ones more useful. 

My only beefs with the game is the team-killing and matchmaking. I wish they'd do more to deal with team-killers. A team-kill in the preparation stage should be an insta-kick, as there are no attackers in the building and there is really no reason a teammate should die during that stage unless it was done on purpose. They should also institute a point system for team kills that includes short ban periods and goes up from there. A 5-10 minute ban for a few team kills would deter a lot of people from being dumb. 

For the matchmaking, initially finding a game tends to be fine. It's the replacing players that leave that seems to need work. For example, last night we had a teammate leave the game at the very beginning of the first round: he was never replaced by a new player. The enemy team had two people leave throughout the match (not at the same time) and they were both soon replaced. We played the entire match with 4 people, while their team was constantly replenished. There also needs to be a way to add friends mid-match if there is an open slot, just like in most other shooters. It's kind of annoying that if a friend gets online and wants to play with us, they either have to wait in the lobby until our match is over (which can take a long time), or they hop into a game and quit out when we're done (which screws over their team). "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/batman-arkham-knight-catwomans-revenge-dlc-review	And another win for Arkham City..and yes I mean the PS3 version game is better overall
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/batman-arkham-knight-catwomans-revenge-dlc-review	"It's a damn shame what this season pass ended up giving us. Between this $40 season pass giving us essentially table scraps worth of content per DLC to Battlefront's $50 season pass providing content to compensate for the barebones package the retail game ended up being, I really REALLY hope 2016 DLC models more closely resemble Witcher 3's ""Hearts of Stone"" or Bloodborne's ""Old Hunters"" than the nonsense that these companies have had the audacity to ask us to pay these prices for."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/batman-arkham-knight-catwomans-revenge-dlc-review	I think I prefer playing as Batwomen. She deserved much more attention.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/30/batman-arkham-knight-catwomans-revenge-dlc-review	"Too bad Season on Infamy will replicate previous encounters instead of introducing a few B-list villains. If they do another Batman game I hope they'll return to Origins (disappointing it hasn't improved on City but it was just as good and the story is my favourite):

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/25/minecraft-story-mode-episode-3-the-last-place-you-look-review	This game is absurdly shit. There's virtually no gameplay, it really is an interactive movie lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/25/minecraft-story-mode-episode-3-the-last-place-you-look-review	@dart_feld You could always just not play it. That usually works if you don't like something.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/25/minecraft-story-mode-episode-3-the-last-place-you-look-review	The action in Telltale's games seem to be similar across all of them so do their reviews also get negatively affected by this in the end? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/25/minecraft-story-mode-episode-3-the-last-place-you-look-review	Wack moving on done!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/25/minecraft-story-mode-episode-3-the-last-place-you-look-review	How does this game get a new ep seemingly every month but it takes Telltale near a whole year for its other franchises?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	One lf the best DLC I've played!!Ludwig , Lady Maria and Orphan of Kos are my 3 favorites bosses of the whole game!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	After platinuming Bloodborne I got side tracked platinuming Dark Souls 2 SotFS and Dark Souls 3... finally went back for The Old Hunters. Wow is this good. The atmosphere is so dark and twisted it makes Souls games feel cheerful. I'd give this DLC 9/10. Haven't beat Kos yet, hopefully soon. One of the hardest bosses from any of the 5 Souls games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	"Was late jumping on to the dlc but just finished and it was fantastic. Totally worth it.

Great new bosses, weapons and gear.

Spike in difficulty was intimidating but was very thrilling to finish.
Kos and Ludwig in particular being harder than anything in the main game imo.

Good hunting."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	"Pro:
-Creepy atmosphere
-Secrets galore
-New weapons&abilities
-Creature Design 

Con:
-Few new ideas

What?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	I still have to will myself to finish the base game. Disgaea 5 though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	i think his opionion would have changed if he spent time in the fishing hamlet
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	I'm glad Brandin enjoyed The Old Hunters as an overall experience but I tend to disagree with much of what he has to say when it comes to his feelings about enemy design and bosses. This murders nearly every other DLC in the past year and in some ways exceeds the vanilla experience. The environments, enemies, weapons, and bosses all felt unique and were a marvelous addition to the world of bloodborne. Sure you could argue its a little more of the same, but it's supposed to be isn't it? This is an extension of the original game, not an entirely new one. At the end of the day it is all subjective, but its hard to sit back and read a review written by someone who only scratched the surface on what this DLC meant for the story and how much attention to detail is included. I understand it, someone who reviews games for a living can't necessarily get caught up with the little details, but at the same time I feel like it doesn't do the game and developer justice to only review the game at a surface level. Just my 2 cents. Personally I thought the bosses were four of the best in the entire game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	@jtgame There are 5 bosses (unless you aren't counting the Living Failures?)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	@The_alchemist90 @jtgame Oh man, completely forgot about the Living Failures haha. Yeah so four out of five were some of the best bosses to date. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	@jtgame @The_alchemist90 I agree. The Failures weren't bad though just different. If they had implemented some of the mechanics of that fight slightly differently (not going into detail because I don't want to ruin anything for someone who hasn't played it yet), it could have been considered a great boss as well though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	NG+4 Ludwig is soooo difficult. That charge attack....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	Good review!  One of the better looks at a new release, if an expansion, i've read at IGN in a while.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	Is this DLC free if I already have the game?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/23/bloodborne-the-old-hunters-review	@ethanbank91 No, unless you have bought the Complete Edition which includes the DLC
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	I play this game with my girlfriend and her brother and it never gets old ( we also play mario party 10 a lot ) the game visuals are great and controls are easy to learn, this game is great and super fun for playing with friends, for solo player i believe oyu might get bored pretty fast because it lacks campaign mode. Just for the multiplayer this game is a must ( I bought it for 39 USD, which is a very fair price for the game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	They should just make another Mario basketball game because Mario Hoop 3 on 3 was amazing. Or Mario Strikers. Come on Nintendooooooo
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	This will be the first mario tennis I skip. Xenoblade here I come!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	And here I am still waiting patiently for a sequel to Mario Strikers Charged
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	ok this is coming from a mainly sony ps4 llayer but how in GODS name did this get a 4.8 but battlefront got a 8 when battlefront has basically no content and i dont even know how but more casual than this 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	Exactly. IGN has it out for Nintendo. In the Wii section half the articles are about other systems?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	@ConradB123 orrrrr this is just a bad game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	@ConradB123 Maybe some of those game are I don't know: happen to be available on other systems? But let's just forget that Mulitplatform exists.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	@DevilMayCry898 But this is Nintendo. Multiplatform barely exists because third-party barely exists.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	@thesanz11 cause IGN likes the deep pockets of certain companies. Far as I'm concerned, IGN has no credibility left. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	"I was really looking forward to this title after playing it at the Nintendo booth during E3 2015. For goodness sakes, what happened to all the game modes like tournaments and challenges? Are Mii's no longer a fad? Other than the HD visuals and Amiibo integration, this game is worse than the Mario Tennis Open on the 3DS that came out in 2012. I wish I had cancelled my pre-order after seeing all the negative reviews. Oh, Camelot, what has happened to you? :(

Bring back Mario Power Tennis and Mario Tennis: Power Tour!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	"Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash - 4.8
Game & Wario - 5.1

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	It is what it is. All eyes are on E3 2016 for The Big N.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	"@wowclones I wouldn't recommend Battlefront. It's pretty shitty.

I see what you did thar"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/mario-tennis-ultra-smash-review	Wrong. This game is incredibly fun. There are exactly the right amount of characters and modes. Too many times games try to add characters and modes to make up for gameplay, this game does not. IGN reviews are becoming predictable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	I HATE ANIMAL CROSSING AMIIBO FESTIVAL- Cherdtranic
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	"The review is right in that its a multiplayer game, like pretty much every board game out there, and some of the mini games are hit and miss.
If you're curious about the game there are some things the review surprisingly omitted, like that you can customise the villiage using landmarks that changes how the board works, or how every month you choose is unique, or that points you earn by playing level up your amiibo, which unlocks new emotions and costumes. Using amiibo cards, you can also choose who moves into this board/village, and up to 8 villagers can join with customised housing.
Just thought id point this out, considering both my wife and i are AC fans and we're enjoying it. It wont blow you away, and its not for everyone, but its definitely fun and ridiculously cute"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	"Retailers are trying to give the Amiibo away. The Festival Bundle is going for 33 bucks and individuals for 7-8 bucks. Nintendo can't base Amiiibo around a single game, SSB is based on many, and now that people know that Amiibo wont increase in value, the demand has dropped by a large margin. We are at a point where retailers will start to take a loss and have their shelves congested if they order many more. 

Kids don't want these obscure characters and adult collectors, who now view them as worthless, are starting to pass. The reality was that most people passed on Little Mac and Villager and did not cry out for them until they saw that they were valuable. The outcry for reprints was really about adults who kicked themselves for having passed up on what would become a rare/valuable items not because so many of them really wanted that Villager or Little Mac Amiibo in their life. 

Take away the concept of expected inflation, and Amiibo will become a very hard product for retailers to move now that they are viewed as common. Call it the Amiibo paradox. Obscure Nintendo Amiibo that are not expected to inflate in price will begin to go unwanted as they would have in the 1st place if Nintendo hand't purposefully constrained certain ones. Compare this to when people stood in line and could not get enough. It is always better to leave the public wanting more instead of over-saturating the market. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	They should have just made another full Animal Crossing game for the Wii U. It would have looked so much nicer and worked a million times better with the addition of the game pad. And they definitely would have had more people buy the Wii U just to get this game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	@SilentFame main core was working on HHD, ND Cube was responsible for this, that's why
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	I've never gotten the appeal of any of the Animal Crossing games. Although I've never played them... I prefer Zelda :D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	Buy xenoblade chronicles X instead. This game is amazing!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	"The reviewer got it right, the game is on the boring side. They should have add multiplayer online mode and abilities to buy more items + characters to customize your board.  This game could have been so much better and amazing if they added online mode. I really wish Nintendo would patch it and take it to the next level. As it is now, the 5 is wholly deserved!! Only buy this if you are a die hard Amiibo + Animal Crossing fans, since other than the cute factor, there is not much ""gameplay"" to be had."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	"You can buy more abilities and landmarks to customize your village/board, as well as use amiibo cards to move new villagers in.
Agree with online aspect but its a family game, cant say its essential to have an online option
Maybe being able to share your customised village/board online wouldve been cool yeah"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	My sister bought this. I felt really bad when she got it because I felt like she got horribly ripped off (over $90 with tax here in Canada), and I didn't want to play it with her. She liked it and really only wanted the Amiibos. I guess everyone has their own preferences.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	@LividBear god damnit, play it with your sister. At least 2-3 games. It will make her happy, and the game is not that bad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	@Leaf131 @LividBear   Maybe im missing something...because i just tapped the amiibo repeatedly...and that was the extent of it...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	You mean like theres something more to board games than throwing dice?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	@Nourldean I don't pay 15.99 for the dice though, they usually come with the game. If i pay extra for different dice i would want a bit more, but meh to each their own.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	@Nourldean it's also 79.99 for that game, i could buy a board game for 15...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	Wii Party U is still the best mini game collection on the Wii U, and there's not really a close second.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	@FortyZombies I'ts not a party game it's a board game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	I never understood why reading is required for these games. My kid, from ages 3-5 really wanted to play these, but he can't read. By the time he's able to read he doesn't want to play them anymore.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/18/animal-crossing-amiibo-festival-review	@FortyZombies Animal Crossing has always been a text-based game, where have you heard they aren't?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	" This is an excerpt of Nerdent's review of Sword Art Online: Lost Song (http://www.nerdent.net/2017/04/22/sword-art-online-lost-song-game-review/)
I am a big fan of the Sword Art Online Series so when I heard that a new one was being made and you could fly in it I was pretty excited to hear. When it comes to Sword Art Online Lost Song some of the things that I enjoyed were the flying mechanic, the combat, and the customization. The combat is interesting because each of the Nine Races uses Specific weapons and the different weapons work well with each race."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	Just got my copy http://www.play-asia.com/sword-art-online-lost-song/13/708v3r?tagid=1415491
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	This game isnt 100% perfect but Boring story??? plz i spent days laughing about this game bc it was so funny like I love it Just the leveling system is hard
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	"The silly thing is the anime literally wrote how to make turn it into a game. Sad thing is no one will do it and make a mmo. 

The only people who would enjoy this game are hardcore fans, but it feels very empty and hollow."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	@FrozenFuryFox Im a hard core fan And I love this game Just hate only having 3 high level guys and struggling to level everyone else up. But Its my goal.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	"I would rate this game a 6/10 I'm use to Dynasty warrior style games, crush horde's of enemies to progress through the story. However this game with some tweaking could have the potential to be a great MMORPG, take away the story line, make the maps bigger include all of Alfheim and or Eincrad Make a level 250 cap, use the Skill point system from Hollow Fragments, and the Magick system from Lost Song and boom, Combined with Bigger dungeons and such. You could get close to an MMO that would be worth playing.  I would like to see a Sword Art game that does these things. In Terms of story junkies saying 'what about the story', LOTRO players take up a role as a 'hero' and run their own thing as the main party tries to destroy the ring. that's all they'd need to do here for an MMO. Everyone's off doing their own thing, while the main 'anime Party' stuff is going on, and you are a bystander player who just kinda rolls along with it. Anyway's Just some thoughts

~In regards to Lost Song.

Cons
-Repetitive game-play
-Lots of Grinding
-Lack of Character Customizing
-Fights are pretty Standard.
-Lack of Character Information ; (Requires you to play the first game)

Pro's
- Well it's a Bandaii Anime game
- Flying Combat
- Great Visuals
- Refined Combat System


I give this game a 6/10, I mean I do like this game, but given my 23 years of gaming experience, I have played many games that exceed this games current ability to thrill. That being said, The Price "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	Take away the story? Lol All successful MMO's have great story's...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	@Zst0rme sooo Final Fantasy XI and XIV are the only successful MMOs?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	I'd probably go for the new Trails for a Vita game, or towards Disgaea 5 on PS4 over this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	So they did not pay you for the review right? Game is just fine as long as you understand how an MMO works and appreciate the anime.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	I understand how MMO's work and love anime/manga but this game is so dull I'd give it a 4/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	"Let's face it, the only way the franchise is good is when it's done by Something Witty Entertainment (SWE) - the guys behind Sword Art Online Abridged.

How good is the abridged series? I've met several people who loathe the normal show, but sing the praises of SWE's work."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	Thought this was a pretty fun game so far. Not sure how this got a 6.0 while Star Wars Battlefront got such a high review despite being the worst disc I've ever brought. (Can't even call it a game it had such little content) Probably IGN being biased as always. Besides we all know big companies like EA pay for their reviews. Anyway this is a pretty fun game if you like JRPGs and it will kill some time till more games on this genre come out.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	@zapaq the reason why u dont like the new battlefront is bc u probably never play the other ones. If u have u would have loved the new starwars battlefront bc it is an awesome game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	@Presto_SelfServe @zapaq Or the lack of campaign, and lack of maps, and lack of prequel trilogy material, and $50 season pass (THE FUCK?!?) and customization, and...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	@Presto_SelfServe @zapaq How about the fact that it is nothing like the old ones? It has less content in it than a ps2 game.....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	@Presto_SelfServe @zapaq You got it backward the old battlefront on ps2 was way bettter than the new one on ps4
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	@zapaq where did you bring it? Oh you meant BOUGHT. Learn to spell
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	Holy cow he put in a letter in accident?!? How dare he!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/17/sword-art-online-lost-song-review	The flight limitation was there in the anime so it makes sense
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	bad game mode , unbalance walker assault , terrible connection.......
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	@jovimak terrible game in short
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	With the game having come out over a year and a half ago, and all the DLC having been released, I can say I truly appreciate what the game has become. If you aren't willing to pay extra money for all the DLC, then the game is a little bit better than when it released, but still not worth the price. If you get all the content, though, it's amazing. For DICE's first effort, they've crafted a really fun Star Wars game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	I picked the game up when it first came out, even paid for the season pass and all that. It was a complete waste of money. I like to consider myself a Star Wars fan, but this game is just horrible. If you want to have fun, you have to completely do it online. Maybe I'm just too old school, but I enjoy a fun campaign. I don't know how many people still really play, but if they could have made an addition that brought the original battlefront to the game, it would be worth playing. The makers said the weren't going for that though and I still decided to give the game a shot, and I wasted money.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	@dball232 i couldn't agree more, looks awesome ill give em that but thats where to pros literally end and the possible Guinness world record holder of cons ever
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	Since this game has had bad comments and reviews i would like to put an update for any potential new players, since the last dlc for this game is coming out in few days. I have played this game since beta on PC and im still playing it, and its a great game. Its ONLY multiplayer, but whats wrong with that? You play singleplayer on Battlefield and jump straight to multiplayer. It has tons of maps and tons of different multiplayer games. Its still alive, it still has a lot of players, on pc and consoles. No, theres no server problems anymore, ocasional hackers but fairfight is baning them constantly. But i must agree, this game is not worth 60$, not even close. So my advice is to pick this game cheap, with all dlcs (cause you will have more fun), and give it a shot, and see for yourself that this trashtalk is just from the players who cant give up on their old star wars games. And EA is investing completely in star wars games in the future, so this is just a start. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	"@Chimichanga0 ""Its ONLY multiplayer, but what's wrong with that?""

Apart from the horrible load times? And the fact that multiplayer games are universally filled with overpowered players who obsessively play a game meaning others can't get involved, they just die and respawn repeatedly?

Apart from the fact that my daughter who's 10 can't do anything with the credits she earns for playing the offline missions. The collectibles are evidently linked to her EA account, which the game will not allow her to access?

No, its awesome. Really!!!


No, nothing wrong with only multiplayer at all... "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	"@Uncaged3 @Chimichanga0 You expect the motor skills and hand eye coordination and 3rd person and first person gaming experience of your 10 year old daughter to be able to compete in ANY multiplayer PvP game??
Do you want some sort of Kiddy Pool mode for your daughter where she can play with a bunch of other 10 year olds who simply aren't experienced in video games enough to know how to learn the ins and outs of a map, the game mechanics, how to manage cover, lead targets with a gun, learn what guns and what abilities work well on certain maps or even certain areas of maps, pick your targets, work with your team and be situationally aware of the enemy position and angles and not just run head first in the fray like your kid is clearly doing.

The years of fast twitch muscle fibers developed in the dexterity of the hands alone, whether on console or PC in order to be even mediocre at a video game of an action shooter genre like this is smething that I at the age of 29 am still not GREAT at. My KD ratio in Battlefront is 1.24. It's not bad, but it takes a lot of time to figure out what you're doing wrong and what to do right in a game like this. 

I went like 50 and 4 the other day in a round of fighter squadron and at the end I still managed to crash Luke's X Wing into a piece of debris. No player is ""overpowered"", sure there are some guys who are really great gamers, because they play a lot of games. But there are A LOT more of mediocre players, myself included, however the fact remains that your 10 year old girl didn't grow up playing games that took, practice, focus, timing, teamwork, timing and skill to excel at competitively like my generation did."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	"@Uncaged3 @Chimichanga0 I agree that the game is a bit poorly designed in its lvl up system, it feels ratehr annoying to see other players having so much better powerups unlocked while yourself have to grind some lvls before getting to buy these things, its a bit confusing to unlock stuff compared to Battlefield imo.

My biggest gripe with the game is how often you get stuck on hills and roads though. Smooth looking areas literally make it a hassle to get past due to invisible walls and ledges."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	"@Chimichanga0  It might be a bit late but ye i tried the ea access for 7 days trial and added another month to test the game out and im actually surprised how fun it is. The first 10 hours or so is not very noob friendly overall though and it does have a bit of a pay2win design over it sicne the higher lvl unlocks and dlc unlocks seem to give and edge or atleast a alternative in doing better. 

Im overall surprised at how fun the game actually is though, yes the vanilla lvls feel like just plain arenas with not much detail to certai naareas and gameplay is rather casual and random but im surprised at how fun it actually is. Its no battlefield but so far after 7-8 horus or torture where i didnt enjoy it im starting to like it alot better when you get to the grips with the rolling and what the powerups do. Its definitely a pretty enjoyable game and runs really smooth on pc, its a bit more of a ""short mp sessions"" of a game than battlefield though due to the high exhausting tempo but im looking forward to play it a bit more and even mroe for the sequel which im sure will be vastly superior."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	@Chimichanga0 I will pick this game up is only 10 dollars with all the dlcs in ps4 I will give it a try since I ha nothing to play right now
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	Is this game even worth buying at this point for pc ? I ordered a new gamer pc so it feels like im kinda forced to buy it lol but people make it sound like its not even worth it after it got 1 or 2 dlcs released. Does it really get boring so quick, i hear peopel say the sound and graphics are great but thats pretty much it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	@TheGamerPandA  EA has already confirmed Battlefront 2 for 2017 save your money
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	"@Blactrick2 @TheGamerPandA Ye i had found the base game for only $11 around black friday and 20 with the season pass but i just skipped it, seems like the game is literally dead already on pc, around 3500 players at peak hours and it apparently doesnt have a server system ie matchmaking only so you can sit and wait for ages. Its pretty much made for casuals and console demographic tbh. The only way to save it on pc at this poin t is by giving the dlcs or the game free on origin lol.

Might aswell wait for the sequel and hope it will be more deep and have server browser, what a horrible decision theyve made with this game.     "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	@TheGamerPandA @Blactrick2 Dude, you're so wrong. I have been in this game on PC since beta, and here i am, still playing everyday. Game is far from dead, if u have a pass for new dlcs you will have a lot of fun. Matchmaking is still good, you wont wait long to be put in game. Yes, there are some problems, hackers from time to time, but fairfight is baning a lot of them. Theres bigger problem with noobs who just yell cause they dont know how to play lol, but the game is still great, especially if you got it cheap like you did. So in my opinion give it a shot. Hope to see you ingame :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	This game should have scored a 9.0.  Much better than IW.  The multiplayer is really fun to play.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	I wish I would have read these reviews before I wasted 20 bucks on this crap.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	this game sucks, the local co-op is boring and all the maps just suck
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	This game is a piece of shit compared to the original ones
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/12/star-wars-battlefront-review	bullshit U fucking  kidding me and doom 68
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"Spent the better part of the night playing this and this is without question the best Tomb Raider game to date, and this is coming from a gamer that has LOVED all of the Tomb Raider games, except that piece of crap Angel of Darkness. They really did improve every aspect of this game. The environment is massive, the action set pieces are amazingly fun, the tombs are fantastic, and the story is compelling and highly entertaining.

If your a Tomb Raider fan, do not miss out on this one!! IGN's score was right on with this one. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	This is in the $12 edition of Humble Bundle by the way.  I'm definitely grabbing it for that price!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"Over all, I'd agree with the review. From the first playthrough of the game clocking in somewhere at 20+ hours (survivor difficulty), it's a very sold experience that I'd rate around at 9.2, and even assuming I'm being slightly generous atm, a 9.1. Again, this is without the additional game modes or any other features.

It felt like much the same game as the first one initially, albeit more polished. Then more and more opened up and added variety to the experience. 

There is nothing I can knock against the game aside from some occasionally awkward jumps where I felt cheated (broadhead arrow platforming, I'm looking at you), but that is par for the course with the genre. There are some notable moments in the game, same as there were in the first one. There are games that have more of them, like people have implied in their comments here, but that's why those games are worth more than a 9.1 in relativity to my scoring. 

On a side note, I find it funny when someone mentions Zelda when that series is known for being relatively stale and the same thing over and over. Apparently Breath of the Wild has changed that, although I haven't yet played it. I just know that ever since Twilight Princess in 2006, one site *cough* Gamespot *cough* said that the formula was getting repetitive, and people got butthurt. It seems that people are too busy defending sacred cows to judge an individual game on its own merits. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"...that one review site *cough* Gamespot *cough* has given them lower review scores since Twilight Princess in 2006 under the claim that the formula was getting repetitive, and people were getting butthurt over the critique of the sacred cow franchise. This game was at least as different from the first one as each Zelda game was from the last one, so to use that as an argument against this game/series and not against Legend of Zelda seems rather unfair.

Overall, this is a very solid experience that stands on its own."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	Here's my honest year and half late review of Rise Of The Tomb Raider over @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/pc/late-rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"I loved the reboot and I enjoyed this game but in the end I felt a bit let down. It was a good thing to make her more real and vulnerable for the reboot, but I would have assumed she had become a little more badass for the second time around. Maybe it's the cold environment, but I felt sorry for her most of the time and expected her to burst into tears every now and then.
The environment looks fantastic but it's just not big enough to have an open world feel to it, which also accounts for very little replayability as you've been everywhere before."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"I loved the first game in the reboot, but this game reminds me of assassin's creed.
- Boring side missions .
- Meaningless collectibles that were boring to collect.
- The tombs were too easy (maybe they need to take lessons from the legend of Zelda series for this) and the rewards were underwhelming and useless.
My overall grade for this game is 5/10- mediocre
This style of action adventure has been done so many times it's gotten stale for me, the same can be said for Uncharted."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	Did not enjoy this game at all, really lacks character development 4/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"Could say alot about this game but I'll keep it basic.

Overall the Game is Really Good. Put in 45 hours.
New Crafting Mechanic is GREAT adding further credence to my views that the gameplay is a bit more layered than Uncharted. When you also consider the more open level design for different approaches and the Skills unlock/Progression.

Now...

Same thing can be said about the last game...

Story, Characters, A particular awesome moment either by gameplay or a Scripted Setpiece...NOTHING. Nothing I will remember a week from now let alone years.

The gunplay is just 'okay' but I can deal with that. 
Tomb Raiders biggest issue comes from having nothing that is memorable something that Sticks with you and can Identify as ""Oh THAT Game, THAT moment, THAT Character"".

That for me is the biggest difference between this and Uncharted and what they should strive for going forward, particularly for a Story driven Action Adventure title."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"It's cursed by how good the last game was. It just feels like more of the same, even though that's good enough.

Also, the rapidly crumbling landscape thing is overdone. It's constant. It's 10 hours of sheer luck that she doesn't die at any given moment. scale it back."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	I'm finally getting around to playing this game and your comment sums up my feelings perfectly sir.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	"This game IMO gets a solid 6/10. Why you ask? Well, let me list the cons and you decide the pros on your own, ok? Here I go:
-No character development whatsoever. The villains lack a LOT and don't feel like antagonists but more like background enemies. You don't care about anybody or anything because characters are just... empty.
-The story has been made way too many times. They had a good setting with the whole Prophet and religion thing, but it came to naught. They could've taken it way further but decided to make it a 100% predictable story; you know the ending of the game since the game begins... at least I did.
-Exorbitant amount of guns, skills and clothing that you will never use at all. Skills that you'll end up getting them all eventually, causing Lara to become The Terminator.
-Not enough puzzles. The puzzles are great, but they went for the mercenary Lara Croft instead of the archaelogist historian that Lara Croft is. Optional tombs are the best part of the game because it distracts you from the constant battles and the empty story by giving you cool puzzles.
-Lack of emotion. It seems as if everybody was trained to not have emotions. Not a single character in the entire story has any type of feeling in them except anger, for no reason at all.
My verdict: The game feels rushed in every sense of the word. Characters are lacking emotions, background and development. Gameplay is extremely linear, but with a wider map filled with annoying rabbits that you'll eventually have to hunt in order to get those pelts for your weapon/inventory upgrades. The graphics looked good, but they weren't an out-of-body experience to look at. The replay value is extremely low."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	I agree, it also feels like every two second Lara is about to die, the amount of time she is left on a cliff and it brakes is sooooo annoying
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/rise-of-the-tomb-raider-review	Tomb Raider trilogy ie LAU are not classics, they're the newer games because only the first 6 games and the 3 golds are the classics and true masterpieces to the franchise. I like all the TR games except for the crystal dynamics ones. TR's 1, 1 gold, 2, 2 gold, 3, 3 gold, 4, 5, and 6 are masterpieces but after AOD the franchise starts to suck because that's where classic lara departs. Crystal dynamics makes shitty awful games full of fecal matter. Whatever you do only stick to 1 through 6 and the 3 golds by core design. Don't waste time trying the crystal games.﻿ it got great reviews but poor combat

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	Here's my honest 2 month late review of Fallout 4 @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/pc/late-early-fallout-4-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	@TheLateGamer  I read some of your other reviews and enjoyed them. I'll read this 1 too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	F*cking bubblegum writer! How much did Todd Howard pay you for your vapid take on the game ? YOURE part of the go@@amn problem in the industry who praises these mediocre piles that are produced. Where's my bullet crafting? Where's the evil options? This game looked good on the onset but was essentially a fail. Factions and tough decisions ? Don't make me laugh
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	New Vegas was sort of better. With every decision and action have effects in the end which makes it interesting. Weapons were awesome. I thought 4 would have the same but the guns look so ugly. The assault rifle looks like a water cooled MG From world war 1.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	"I'd like to weigh in as someone who has started FO4 for my second time through last week, (I finished my first time through about a year ago). I'm a pretty big Bethesda fan. What a great decision that was, for me.

My first time through Fallout 4 was rushed, and had me comparing my experience with other games that had also come out at that time, through comments from reviewers on IGN, Beyond, and in forums, like this one. Unfortunately, (and I blame myself for this), I allowed other people's opinions and observations to cloud my gameplay experience. This was new for me, as I had only been on IGN for a short period of time.

I'm loving this game much more than I did my first time through. The graphics, little details, crafting, storylines, gameplay, exploration, and overall atmosphere seem much more robust and all-engrossing for me...that's Bethesda. I'm so glad I gave this game a second chance, a year later. There seems to have been lots of fixes since last year, and I'm reminded about what a massive, in-depth world Bethesda creates. Also in the middle of Skyrim Remastered, and starting Dishonored 2,  I'm reminded about why I love Bethesda games so much. With the freedom to move and interact with the environment while engaging in a variety of heartfelt and immersive storylines, it truly does put you in another world. I also have much more respect for the gameplay, crafting,  and combat systems, this time around. I've played some of the other big titles from 2015-2016, and I'm happy to put Fallout 4 right at the top with them, again."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	@groglikesgames  I tried to replay Fallout 4 and sadly don't enjoy it. I love Fallout 1,2,3&NV but can't get into F4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	The vault tec DLC sucks I cant connect room pieces to the atrium. I just did the quest gave all the essentials and diched it. The workshop items are cool but id like a vault to manage. I wish a patch would apply to this DLC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/09/fallout-4-review	"Waking up to discover that the world is no longer what it was, and that everything you once knew has been reduced to a desolate wasteland that is filled with unknown and dangerous creatures. Fallout 4 is the game that has taken the hearts of adventure and survival gamers everywhere. This game not only contains a extremely interestingmain story line, which centers around the main characters journey through a post-apocalyptic Boston frozen in the 1950’s as he/she searches for his/her child, but it also has an interesting and captivating sci-fi and steampunk type of theme. This theme allows for several interesting side quest to this open-world masterpiece, spanning from starting colonies to exploring the crash point of an alien spacecraft. On the subject of Fallout 4, GameSpot states that “you become attached to the new you”, showing how engrossing and life like the experience truly is. Although the game may seem a little easier than its predecessors, It is easily compensated by the advanced and more realistic interactions that can be made with the multitude of characters within the game.
A captivating story may be important, but nowadays it just doesn’t cut it. A game needs to have more in order to stand out from the others. The aspect that I believe makes Fallout 4 stand out the most is not the story, but the graphics that plunge the player into the game headfirst. The game has been designed with so much scrutiny that  the artists even managed to put life into a barren wasteland. With the hyperrealistic human expressions, and the terrifyingly realistic monsters to be found within the “commonwealth”, the players feel as if they  are viewing it all with their very own eyes. When Bethesda worked on the previous Fallout games, they spent years working on every detail of the game. Though all this work however, it was apparent that movement was something that was very difficult to portray in a video game. However, in Fallout 4, they mastered movement, down to the way a dog’s hair bristles when hostile.  It should be noted, however, that all of this comes with a price; that price is the long loading screens. This screen will be a common sight while playing the game, because of how vast the game is. Although the continuous loading may be tedious and slightly vexing, it is quickly forgotten when the gameplay resumes."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	"Probably the worst multiplayer ever. There is no balance in multiplayer. Almost impossible to get high killstreaks. There is no spawn delay. You get spawned killed no matter how careful you are. 

Zombies at it's best. Hard, but beatable. It's the only reason why I play this game is for zombies. My only gripe would be if shadows of evil could be beatable on solo. The only thing I dislike about treyarchs zombies is some of the maps require all 4 players to be present to do the easter egg. So hard to find good players."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	@universemaster Maybe it's just your bad at it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	"Black Ops 3: 9.2
Advanced Warfare: 9.1
Battlefield 1: 9.0"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	I like the single player campaign a lot it left me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The scifi story is amazing. I hate military stories they are boring. The Zombies mode as always never draws me in it looks good but killing zombies gets old. The exstra modes like free run are dead ops are fun if you have nothing else to do but not much depth. I like the multi player mode its awesome but you die really fast and have to play a really long time before you can really get good. I also really like the offline bots wish they would continue to update offline multi player. The nightmares campaign was not very good in my opinon they should have made a whole new story mode. I really like the game it is my favroite black ops game. I only like black ops 1 for its combat training. I hated black ops 2. I loved ghost for squads mode. The ability to level up and progress through multi player with out ever having to battle a real person was amazing brought me right back into call of duty. I liked advanced warfairs campaign a lot. Giving black ops 3 a 0 or even 5 is strange it plays pretty well I like wall running a lot. People need to grow up if you dont like a game then dont even review it. i don't review games I dont like lol why waist the time. Also as a gammer community we need to stop over hyping things up if its good its good it dosent have to be a god send lol. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	Wish there was more going on, or larger maps with more options for cover. The problem is that you can traverse the maps quickly with your abilities and learn the maps as quickly so there are many choke points and becomes repetitive. Halo 5 is gearing more towards COD play style but the maps are bigger and there are more options. Battlefield has always been where I have the most fun. I still play BF4 and actually like Hardline.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	Love this game. Downside~ everyone is flying around like a rocketeer. The series is turning into another cyborg FPS. Black Ops 2 was the perfect COD experience in my opinion. Love this third iteration, just need to catch up to all the rocket booster mechanics, which is a game changer for better or worse. Graphics are amazing needless to say.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	I picked it up cheap seeing as I had nothing to play. This game is hot garbage. Contrived and just plane stupid story. This is why IGN has zero integrity.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	Yeah this game sucks. Even Advanced Warfare is better than BO III. The Campaign is boring and confusing. I've played/beat every Call of Duty and this is by far the worst COD. On the surface, having customizable loadouts seems like a good idea for single player, but it's actually much better suited for multiplayer. I hate having to level up my guns in campaign. I hate how they give you abilities at the beginning of campaign and then take them away and then make you earn them back. Which wouldn't be a problem, but then it takes forever to earn the necessary tokens to unlock weapons/abilities and by the time you do, the campaign is over.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-3-review	@Nggamerboy Why did you buy COD expecting good narrative? I mean sure, BO1 was pretty good for call of duty standards, but other than that, its' always mediocre.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	I got it for 12$ on Xbox, hopefully it's a good game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	How does this compare to Need For Speed rivals? Are there any better alternatives for this type of racer?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	"Everyone has their own opinions. I like the way the creators suck you in from the start. The intro with the real life roleplay. But the moment you get to drive. . . . . Disappointing. First thing come to mind was to return the game and trade. 
But too bad you can't trade digital download. So I have a game that has to take up space on my xbox one hard drive because I don't want to delete it. But game creators don't care cause they've cashed in for all they care. Poor effort. If you want a comparison between Need For Speed and ANY of the Forza games. Try comparing a Toyota to a Rolls Royce and you have your answer."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	"The game sucks at many places:

1. I hate the onscreen messages constantly interrupt your game.2. Keyboard setup are not intuitive. Took me a while to figure out how to quit the game.3. While you are in a run, you still get calls and messages, quite disturbing. 4. It costs $70. Totally not worth it.
I would rate 1/10. Totally regret it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	I can't believe Ign gave it an okay come on I bet they did wait to last update the speed list I give the game 5 stars they did a lot in the game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	The problem continues to be the handling. I adjusted it and it still feels off (the Hot Pursuit that came out in 2010 had pretty good handling for the cars). And the open world really doesn't do much other than drag out how long it takes to get to the races. That said, it isn't at all awful, and while I still don't like the handling, I have adjusted to it. Though, now I'm curious to see what other arcade style racing games there are for the PS4 that are good.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	You have to find to right tuning for the car u tune it the way u want to u just got to keep playing around with it and then u will find your tuning
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	can we talk about the complete lack of cop chases? they're so easy and short you don't even feel them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/need-for-speed-review-3	graphics are awesome and the car customization is great! story is pretty good, the drifting is very nice. the only reason i cannot stand this game is because of how the cars turn! honestly... it either barely wants to turn or  turns to sharp. its like it has selective turning and it's quite annoying. probably give it 6/10 for that reason alone. if the cars actually turned like they're supposed too, id say this was a 10/10

Every stage in Darksiders 2 really matters, at least you always face terrible monsters not some dumb dwarves that keep you out by a wooden door, and in the end your prevail and transform into the reaper to carry out your enemies executions. That really feels awesome.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/darksiders-2-deathinitive-edition-review	I never play Action games just because I find the mindless button mashing boring, this game was really nice, intricate puzzles, great loot, you felt like you rly had good use for your gold loot etc.. there are way too many games where it doesnt rly matter.. this game is fantastic even if you're not an action adventure player like myself.. this is a great pick up definitely worth atleast 8.5
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/darksiders-2-deathinitive-edition-review	This game deserves a higher rating than 7.5 for people still wondering if it's worth a playthrough. I feel it's a solid 9 because of the art style, and decent if not excellent combat. The only real drawbacks are : too much loot !!! a couple of camera issues, and a lot of the dungeons, at least in the first world, are samey / reuse assets. These are minor gripes. Like Wind waker, the art style is timeless and couldn't be better. The swimming, fighting, wall climbing mechanics are very well done. Very impressed and kind of sad I held out buying for so long.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/11/02/darksiders-2-deathinitive-edition-review	I hate how so many reviews on action/combo smashers like to assume God of War was the one to start it all... everyone bashed dantes inferno for GOW combat and castlevania LOS... God of war stole its game mechanics from Devil may cry.. and other games...  God of War is just more widely known for some reason.. possibly because its so fucking boring or because many love it.. blindly ...  I love combo smashers so I really dont care if something imitates another combo game I love it in fact.... some people just think  they know it all. Darksiders should have been remastered though..  darksiders 2 sucked with rng and replacing weapons constantly... darksiders 1 did it better with finding the apocoplytic armor and sword... it rewarded you with legendary weapons and armor that was bad ass and the best looked cool too!  Then Darksiders 2 you get shitty armor and weapons the whole time once you get the supposedly best in game weapons they suck compared to your present ones... the whole loot system was fucked... up!  Darksiders 1 did it better with set weapons not replacing your shit every fucking minute like an rpg similar to borderlands.. or diablo it was really taking away from the experience seeing sythe after sythe drop.. in the end I refused to upgrade my scythe and just give my self a handicap the entire playthrough because it was soo annoying seeing weapons drop constantly... I hate rng but I really hate it when its in a game for no reason but to be a awful game mechanic Darksiders 1 did it perfectly making it more zelda like.. where darksiders 2 was just diablo rng style with lackluster fights..  I found the game to be soo awful I beat it and sold it... I still have darksiders 1 ... 2 I refuse to own... I love the story and death as a character.. but the game as a whole is just awful....  it couldnt bring me any joy only more confusion as to how it strayed soo far from the original.... in terms of game play mechanics...  and loot system... if you can ignore the terrible loot mehanics and horrifying attempts and rng items you can find some good gameplay... but I hate having to hold my nose and swallow awfulness  ...soo I no longer own this title... Darksiders 2 lost all its roots from the first installment.. it was a tree with no roots! It fell hard!  Looked pretty though... dont all tress.... Hopefully Nordic games will redeem themselves  and make darksiders 3 play more like the first one... or atleast remaster darksiders 1 so fans can atleast play that while the casuals play the rng nightmare games.. I wont play another Darksiders game if rng is present again... Ill just go oh.. nope..  If I wanna play a game with Rng I'll do it right and play a game that actually needs rng where there is more than 1 weapon variant and its not all about the same weapon different damage...  Dark souls does this well.... farm for a few hours get a bad ass amor set that looks like the enemy and get the enemys weapons.... not kill something for hours and get the same item over and over just different damage... thats just broken gameplay... rng only works if you have an extensive list of items that are in the game so their is alot of variety... otherwise its a pointless system just meant to make you bored.. and feel like everything is way too repetitive.

Turn the difficulty up to legend and adjust the game sliders, it's a great game, the graphics are just a little bit off on some wrestlers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/wwe-2k16-review	I haven't purchased a wrestling game since WWF Smackdown: Here Comes the Pain. I decided to pick this up because Stone Cold was on the cover and I figure it's time to try the new stuff. It's been 2 days and already I want to sell this piece of crap. I'm not a twitch gamer but that's what the pin and reversal systems seem to be geared towards. The submission system is beyond stupid and I've yet to successfully pin someone out of 27 matches. They won't stay down even when they're beaten and bruised beyond all recognition. 10 solid minutes of beating Brock with a chair and I still couldn't get the 3 count. What kind of bs system is this?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/wwe-2k16-review	@TheOracle8191 i would seriously recommend WWe13 and wwe 14 just to play through the attitude era and all WM matches. and you could probably get both for 20$
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/wwe-2k16-review	@TheOracle8191 What system would you suggest for the pin? I don't see another way that really works besides jamming a button really fast to kick out i guess.

I'm sure that I will replay this game as the diverging paths add a lot of content.  But this episode 2 was surprisingly short compared to the first episode.  But then again, I haven't played a lot of Telltale episodic games as I typically stick to playing their LEGO games with my kids from time to time."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	56% is pretty damn harsh for this game / episode.  Maybe it's not GOTY, but it's not that bad either.  81% of the owner reviews on Steam are positive, and that's more like it if you ask me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	I like Telltale, but this is probably the first one I'm going to skip. It just doesn't look that interesting at all. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	Well, I sure hope telltale does better on episode 3. Episode 2 was a little disappointing, but I don't know why it got a 5.6. I would probably rate it a 7 or a 6.8.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	"It's fairly entertaining to watch Minecraft Story Mode on Youtube. As a game it just doesn't look like there's much of a game going on. There's some quicktime events, there's dialog choices and a scant few puzzles, but over all the player seems mostly capable of choosing the tone of how events unfold. In the previous installment you're caught on a bridge with monsters approaching from both ends, you have a choice of whether to fight or jump. Whatever you choose, you soon find yourself jumping off the bridge (and a neat opening credits scene happens). Later on you're given the choice of whether to make a tree house or a dirt house to take shelter in for the night. It seems largely cosmetic since events proceed much the same in either case. Maybe there is a payoff later down the line based on which of your friends' suggestions you endorsed. It seems as though in episode 2 the character you don't go to recruit questions you a bit on your choices. 

Over all It's like a semi-interactive cartoon rather than a traditional game.

Why don't you let kids review kids' games? I don't care for teddy bears, and I could write reviews about why they do nothing for me, but why?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	"@Pokeparkranger 1) Kids can't write reviews.  Anyone who says they can is just kidding themselves.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	"@applesngrapes @Pokeparkranger We've actually done experiments with this. If you look back at some of our Skylanders reviews, some were reviewed by parents, who enlisted the help of their kids. As a father of three, I can tell you that I have a pretty good sense and understanding of what my kids enjoy (and don't enjoy) in games -- but they still have a hard time articulating it. 

That said, we do take the target audience into consideration with game, movie, and TV show reviews. Minecraft has a very broad audience -- if Story Mode succeeded at being entertaining for kids, the reviewer certainly wouldn't ding it for that.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	"@applesngrapes Actually, I bet my 9-year-old daughter would kind of blow your mind. She writes very eloquently and totally understands what she wants to say and how to put it into words. Her vocabulary is excellent. Also, the 1000 words on a deadline she would absolutely slay that. No problem. 
Your second point is not logical at all. Most kids are not on the internet and are less likely to be documented as Minecraft players. I understand that there are many adults who play Minecraft, but if you think Minecraft:Storymode is made for adults, you're disillusioned."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	"@Peer-IGN @applesngrapes @Pokeparkranger I think we need to be careful not to review a kids' game from an adult's point-of-view. 
I am reminded of when Splatoon was released and a lot of adults were complaining that there was no voice chat. Jose even dinged it for that very reason. Yet my daughter plays that game every day and never has complained once about it not having voice chat. I can see that adults feel the need because maybe they are playing online with their friends, but Splatoon is a game that invites everyone to play. It's not the type of adult military style shooter with the kind of violence which real guns, blood, gore, etc. illustrate. Kudos to Nintendo for not having voice chat. All you would hear would be cursewords and derogatory spew from frustrated adults. 
Justin says this episode of Minecraft: Storymode is too short. I understand why he might think that from an adult's point of view, especially someone like Justin who has played zillions of games and pretty much gets paid to play video games. However, this is an ""episode"" we are talking about. It's not a game in itself. My daughter has played through the first episode at least 5 times and got something different out of it each time. I doubt she will complain that episode 2 is too short. Most of the games I grew up playing were extremely short, but that didn't keep me from playing the hell out of them over and over."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	"@Pokeparkranger @Peer-IGN @applesngrapes I think it's super-important that reviewers keep the target audience in mind -- but that also shouldn't exonerate the developer from dropping smart features that can hold back the experience for a significant portion of the audience. Splatoon is actually quite a complex game, control- and strategy-wise, and appeals to teens who are used to voice chatting and skyping with their friends. Garden Warfare is a good example of a game that manages to serve both younger and older gamers, but doesn't limit the communications options. Likewise, Splatoon could provide parental controls or even, more radically, limit voice chat to friends or teams only.  Instead, the game offers ways to play, but not communicate, with friends. Given that it's such a strategic title, that's a fact worth bringing up in a review. Games like Minecraft and Terraria are enjoyed by thousands of kids every day who spend more time playing in no small parts due to the fact that they can chat with their friends while exploring the game worlds. Now, those games benefit from cross-chat functionality on other platforms, which Wii U unfortunately doesn't have.

I haven't downloaded Storymode for my kids yet. I hear you on the difference between kids' viewpoints and adults'. LEGO games that score in the 7s are often better (and more enjoyable) choices for kids than open-world games that score in the 9s. It's the challenge of writing reviews for consumers that seek out reviews (kids don't care about critics -- they play what their friends play) and not easily solved on a site that doesn't specifically cater to kids. But given that we've got more parents on our team now, doing more frequent parent guides with selections of games that their kids would enjoy may be a good solution. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/30/minecraft-story-mode-episode-2-assembly-required-review	"@Pokeparkranger @applesngrapes Yeah, Minecraft is one of the most popular kids' brands of all time. The audience isn't limited to kids -- but kids are the biggest part of the audience by far.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review	ok so no split screen co op or fucking LAN. and it gets a 9 / 10 ? IGN how much did microsoft suck your dick for?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review	@mch33f Also, a terrible story that undermines Halo 4 and a mediocre multiplayer that launched with half the content of a normal Halo game and the only new mode has pay to win microtransactions.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review	Can they ever rate a Halo game NOT solely based on MP experience? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review	@Kenk0inc  They just did... and it's name is Halo 5.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review	Can't believe they gave Halo 5 a 9/10 lol.  This game is bad.  Very bad. Bad characters, bad writing, bad story, bad online play, bad everything.

Give me Deathmatch and Capture the flag, now we have all of those modes + countless user created modes.

Man you could honestly spend infinite hours playing this game which I don't have. I honestly feel Halo 5 mode is just too much....."

Well welcome to the 2000's friend! "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/halo-5-guardians-review	Game play wise the graphics were really good, the guns were really cool, and it was decently fun to play. Story wise, it was poorly put together. The very first mission they just drop you on your head and expect you to get it. However if you didn't play spartan ops, because you were like me and had to play offline, then you are lost. I have read many of the books so i get most of the character references, however Spartan Locke not only didn't show up in the books, but also not in the previous stories. Look 343 if you aren't going to make chief the main character fine, but you can't just pull some guy out of your ass and make him the main character 5 games in. That is lazy story telling.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	Hey I picked this up but I havnt played it yet. is the story good?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	Just downloaded for PC and uninstalled the original Original Sin.  Can't wait to play this.  I generally don't like games that have dozens of hours of play because they are very time consuming, but I'll give it a shot.  Was going to buy it on PS4 but the 30 FPS lock turns me off.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	It's turn based. The frame rate has zero effect on ANYTHING. Haha
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	@Nitro_glycerinne  Lol, that doesn't mean shit dude. 30 fps still would look way different compared to 144fps on PC, regardless of turn based.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	turn battle is the worst idea for a interesting history and wonderfull graphics, when playing hard mode is imposible to defeat enemies 2 level over characters.... have to throw away the game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	Or just play on normal mode. Your penis won't shrink THAT much dude
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	So i just got this hoping to get into it. I did watch some youtube videos love the coop and split without loading. Last game i even played i think is similar was the summoner on ps2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	"I'd knock at least 2 points off for the huge dialogue box taking up all the screen,not allowing you to see any of your characters interactions..
Apparently i was greeted by a cat at the beginning of the game,didn't know this because i coudn't see who i was talking to,that's as far as i got and as far as i will go..

Huge fail that ruins the experience on what i'm betting would have been a great game."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	I still cant get pass the lighthouse dude and bunch of enemies guarding cave passage. I must have done something wrong with skillpoint distribution.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	"@Karmazynowy Something similar happened to me, had to restart from scratch with the help of an altruist online stranger who chose my starting spells and skills for me according to the play style I wanted, not proud of that ^.^'

Never had a problem since though. Lol."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	@Karmazynowy The fights feel a lot easier than they were in the original version of the game. The lighthouse is actually one of the easier fights. That early on it might not necessarily be your skill point distribution, but your party makeup. It's not necessarily bad (truthfully you can finish this game with anything), but you might have to try something different. If you have two mages in your group, try using different element combos. If you have a ranger, try using special CC arrows, etc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	@FooJones @Karmazynowy cool I will try to do the fight again, it wont hurt to give it a try as I am feeling that I am missing on a great game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	@Karmazynowy Actually the first half of this game is more dificult than he last one,about the fight,you have at least 4 party members?There's 4 you can recruit in Cyseal.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	@incoherentsanity Well, they can if they are present for when player 1 is creating both characters, after making their own player 2 can then create theirs. At that point if you want to play your character you must play with player 1, or else you have to make your own set of two main characters.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	This game is a masterpieces. One of the greatest RPG's I have ever played and easily the best game of 2014.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	@MrDanMan @Coltaine12 Excellent. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	"@MrDanMan @Coltaine12 It's not devoid of humor and interesting narrative, but at least in the first 10 hours it's generic high-fantasy ""Save the world"" stuff. I suppose there will be some interesting twists down the line."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	Love the old school RPG, a really brilliant game to me. However, simple bugs are taking all the fun away. Crashes 50% of the time I purchase something... very annoying... Also laggy, never experienced any similar problems with a PS4 game before. Kind of a disappointment overall
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	@SarnathStreet Have it on PS4 and have zero crashes and problems. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/26/divinity-original-sin-enhanced-edition-review	If having problems try delete and reinstall. Seems some digital games I download sometimes have this problem but a reinstall usually fixes the problem.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	What happened to this series?  Guitar hero 4 and 5 got horrible reviews and scores and now this?  What happened to music games?  Guitar Hero 1, 2 and 3 were so awesome.  How do they forget how to make such a great game?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	Having never played a guitar hero game before (up unti a few months ago actually I played a friends GH (not sure what number it was) I have to say I really love this game. I am a total GH newbie so I'm only on the 2nd level difficulty but I love the songs, the live band first person perspective is AWESOME, and in my opinion, SO much more realistic than cartoony characters. Also, the new guitar configuration is great as I never really liked the 5 button guitar. Have barely scratched the surface of this game and my wife and I love it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	"I LOVE the new guitar. As someone who has played guitar for a long time, I can sY that it feels much more realistic than the old style controller. You actually feel like your playing chords and changing between the white and black buttons feels like you are moving around the fretboard. Its really cool. But the ""Career Mode"" is pretty disappointing. We have played the game a handful of times and only have two setlists left to unlock. I get it, filming all the live action stuff is probably a huge undertaking, but they should have thought about that before switching and maybe went with a CGI first person view. The online portion features a HUGE library, but not being able to play what you want if you run out of plays is a real bummer. The guitar is great, the music is great, the software it self is lacking. Hopefully the next iteration will solve these problems. I'd still recommend it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	as i am typing this, all the years ive played guitar hero and watched the games improve and the setlists getting more complex.. i realize that this guitar hero live is the biggest disappointment ive witnessed in guitar hero history. the setlist, the guitar, everything but the graphics to say the least. the graphics are badass, everything else i want to throw into the sun. i was really hoping that this was going to be something that brought back such a memorable game i grew up with as a kid. but in all honestly, its anything but that. sorry to burst everyones bubble, but katy perry? skrillex? rihanna? i thought this was guitar hero, not laptop bubble gum pop hero.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	I was skeptical when I got this for Christmas but I can honestly say I love the changes. Yes the FMV is cheesy but it accomplishes its goal of putting you in the action and some of the interactions for failing are pretty comical. The set list on the disc is average at best but GHTV more than makes up for it. I have yet to log on and not spend at least an hour plugging away at the most random of songs and easily earning plays for songs of my choosing. Last but not least the new guitar dynamic is the best thing to happen to this franchise period. This completely eliminates the been there done that feeling I had with every GH and rock band game after GH2 which introduced 3 button chords. It is not perfect but damn it is fun. Throw in the actual music videos for hundreds of songs for good measure. Awesome!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	Man oh man, Christmas morning I turned it on and my ps4 wasn't updated so I wasn't online but I wanted to rock so bad I just played GHlive for the last few days and was super pissed about the lame career and multiplayer mode.. Then I updated it and got on GHTV.. Holy shit this game is amazing!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/25/guitar-hero-live-review	Just took the plunge and got this because I wanted something a bit different and I did enjoy guitar hero 3(the only one I owned) and it was going for £44.99 which isn't to bad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review	"If I were in charge of Ubisoft, I'd give my team a pat on the back for recovering the Unity release, then put AC on to a bi-annual release schedule, possibly rotating with Watchdogs.
The extra year will give the developers more time to work on the gameplay rather than simply attaching new skins and rushing a new story onto what is essentially the same game year after year.
That being said, I still enjoy Assassins Creed games and will more than likely pick this up, but I can't help but feel it will be lost in the shuffle due to the immense competition this holiday season, with Fallout, Halo, Tomb Raider and others all coming out at the same time."

My game on XBOX didn't have very many glitches - "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review	"Great game. Characters and setting are among the best in the franchise. I know London might have been too boorish or gritty for some (certainly not as beautiful as Florence or as lush as the Caribbean islands) but I thought each borough had its own personality, and it felt more like a real living place, instead of like the simulation of a real place. The combat animations are slick enough that I never got tired of them, and navigation is better than ever. (Although yes, free-running still hasn't been perfected)

The main assassinations were awesome, but my main complaint would be that the side missions weren't fun at all. Fight clubs are ok (those kill animations!) but crap like the cargo escorts and templar hunts didn't do it for me. And variations of that is really all there is besides collecting. Anyway I loved the ending. At least the Victorian one, with Jacob and Evie and Starrick and that final mission. 
The Abstergo ending was whatever. All the Abstergo stuff was whatever. Stop putting it in there."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review	I've played AC2, 3 and 4 to completion. I loved all three. I also have a bit of gaming OCD in which I like to collect EVERYTHING. This was one of the few games where not even halfway though, I was so bored I packed it up and traded it in the next day. Sadly, this will be my last foray into AC - I've enjoyed it for a while, but with this game, even its repetitiveness was repetitive.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review	"@mybrainhurts
I think this is the best one yet. No stupid difficult lock picking and the combat is easier. Also stealth is almost always optional. Nice!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review	After just spending many hours with fallout 4, AC Syndicate seems too scripted, I can only fight certain people certain ways, with certain tools, in certain places, at certain times. I get markers guiding me to escape, WTF? and the devs are incapable of showing the face of the person talking to me in context instead as a floating speech. The controls aren't natural and sometime I cannot even move because the game can't figure out if I should run, jump or climb. An enemy can be looking right at you from 10 feet away and not see you killing someone. It's ridiculous and a waste of money. Just my opinion, of course.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/22/assassins-creed-syndicate-review	Honestly, the assassins creed story line started to suck after black flag. But the one thing I hated the most. The controls, with unity and syndicate, are too complex that it takes the fun out of free running and it is time consuming. Then with the combat, they need to bring it back to how it was in the ezio trilogy, AC3 and Black Flag. I could play all the AC's up to black flag over and over and not get tired of it. Unity: beat it and returned it, syndicate: didn't even want to finish it. All in all, bring back simple controls and focus on better story line
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	Just finished the series now.  It is interesting but at too many points you just sit there through unnecessary dialogue.  If this were a TV show that would be fine, but in a game where you are looking for interaction and gameplay, this can be quite annoying and tedious.  This is most prevalent in episodes 3, 4, and 5.  % was very good but I got the feeling that nothing that happened in 1 through 4 even mattered.  Ultimately, i only continued with the series to get all 1000 achievement points.  They are very easy to get.  6.5 for the whole series would be an excellent score and quite accurate.  I'm glad I played it and have been exposed to the story line....but I'm also glad it finally over.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	"I always play games so late.  Anyway, subjectively speaking, I'd rank this game between 7 and 8 solely based on the story telling and not the overall game play.  It was a good game and fun to play, but I do agree with many parts of this ign review: The game is linear, most of the characters were flat and underdeveloped, many decisions didn't have a weighty consequence, but simply a change in dialogue (I can accept this as the overall story was very good.), and Episode 5 did feel like a different game.  HOWEVER, the episodes were climaxing towards this ""mysterious storm"" and I think episode 5 was developed to illustrate the chaos, turmoil, and thrill we associate to ominous, cataclysmic, events.  And, yes, no matter the choices a player elects throughout the game, the ending is polarized with one very emotional finale and the other an unsatisfying outcome.  BUT, for me, the point of the game was not to streamline choices for a tailored ending (although I'd like to experience a game likes this one day), but rather to witness this strong friendship reunite after a long hiatus.  The game was thought provoking for me.  A real treat.  I give it an 8.  I'd give a 6.5 to games like Until Dawn."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	I agree completely 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	I have to admit the final episode felt a little off but it did not distract from the game as a whole. It was a difficult decision...to what extent would you go for the person you love?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	"They tried too much in episode 5 and changed it from the great story telling of episodes 1 through 3 into a stupid rewind-fest all through the episode (episode 4 also wasn't good). In the end I chose to sacrifice Arcadia because I couldn't care less about any of the characters at this point.
The high of episode 3 is where they should have stopped this series. Then I would think of this game as a classic for the ages. Now, I have a bad taste in my mouth because it outstayed its welcome."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	I don't think I've ever disagreed with a review so much in my life. I can't even begin to explain how many ways this entire game was perfect. It consistently blew me away over and over again, and not just with the story or the game itself, but the little things. Nothing is a chore, rewind time, skip through what you've already seen, restart certain segments of episodes so you can collect photos. It has so many little touches that I feel bad for getting this game for so cheap.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	This was kinda the Mass Effect 3 ending all over again, at least for me. I didn't feel my choices gave any meaningful changes to the ending—except for the very last one, of course.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	Probably the most emotional game ever in a good way. I will be heavily invested in thier new game Vampyr.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	"I definatley have to disagree with the reviewer. I absolutly loved the game and that ending had me in tears (Sacrificed Chloe). The only thing I dislike is the same thing with all these ""Choices matters"" games, They sell it as something it isnt. Your choices dont matter. The story while amazing is completely linear and your choices dont matter. For example why the hell do I care whether I saved Kate? She is going to live or die anyways based on the ending you choose. In the Walking Dead, why do I bother choosing who lives between two characters if they die in the next episode anyways? Choices dont actually matter and it feels like false advertising. That in mind I think it is still worth an 8"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	@xShoot4WarAmpsx I don't agree with that. Yes, it didn't make much of a difference all the way in the end but it defined your entire playthrough. There's a moment in episode 4 where you talk to Victoria and she will only agree with you if you were nice to her all the way back in episode 1. It's stuff like that that is important in the game. It defines your playthrough. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	@trollscanburn @xShoot4WarAmpsx I get that but my point is, whether or not she agreed with you didnt matter. It was a pointless choice with no consequence. Why do I care if she believes me or if Kate jumps, if in the end, none of that will matter?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	"@xShoot4WarAmpsx @trollscanburn I understand what you're saying but I don't know. I didn't see it that way. My final choice was determined by my actions in the game. I decided to sacrifice Chloe based on my friendships and love towards the rest of the people in the town that I had made during my playthrough. If I hadn't went through it all I wouldn't have cared whether or not to let them all die. That's why I felt that my choices mattered.

Plus, when they say ""your choices matter"" it's not them saying ""your choices will determine the ending of the game and there are like 4 bajillion endings based on that and you'll get to see the conclusion of every single character based on your choices."" No, they mean that if you don't pay attention to Kate or discover something about her or truly know her then you're going to watch her die. If you aren't nice to Victoria in ep1 then ep5 she won't believe you or have your respect. Those are the choices that matter. The only reason it doesn't matter in the end is because it's a time travel story. Most of the time to fix everything in time travel all your choices end up not mattering anyways. Butterfly Effect comes to mind. He spend the entire movie trying to save everything and everyone but in the end he goes back into the womb and kills himself and everything is fixed. None of his choices now mattered. Doesn't make it any less heavy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	@trollscanburn @xShoot4WarAmpsx But those are two different things. Sacrificing Chloe was heavy because the story was built around her and we grew attached to the character. The little decisions we made didnt attribute anything to that. You are right, it is exactly like Butterfly effect and that was the problem. That was a movie, so by playing this game we essentially just watched a movie. It gaves us choices but it never changed anything. For me for my choice to matter there needs to be a consequence. When it came to sacrificing Chloe or saving her, that choice mattered. You made a permanent decision and have to deal with the concequences. There didnt need to be many endings, just character endings. How did you decisions effect Allysa, Kate, Victoria, Warren in the long run? Something similar to the Witcher 3 where there where multiple endings but those endings where based off 4 areas.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-polarized-review	A lot of people disliked the ending but I thought it was great. People complain that you don't know who will die if the tornado hits. That's the beauty of choices, in the moment of you often don't know the repercussions. Also, people complain that all your choices building up don't matter. That's a whole different complicated idea that fate may play a role in life.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	Such an underrated game the story in this is one of the best tales I've experienced in many recent years. While combat can be repetitive like the review said the score really deserved to be a little higher.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	Dark, twisted and cruel and I loved every second of it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	horror games never get good score except a few
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	This game has gotten plenty of mixed reviews. While it isn't perfect? I think it harkens back to the classic survival horror games. It builds tension and incredible atmosphere despite its janky controls and stilted voice acting. I am not that big of a survival horror guy but I have enjoyed my time with the game thus far. Its also rare to see such dark themes on a Nintendo system. Ritual sacrifice and suicide are pretty dark themes. The game certainly doesn't shy away from showing some disturbing imagery. The use of the gamepad is perhaps the most novel and logical use for it (besides Mario Maker of course). This game is proof that a Poke'mon snap game would be a perfect fit for WiiU.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	Just got the demo two days ago and the game is really good, best thing about it would be the controls, just using the Gamepad to control the Camera Obscura makes it really inmersive. Planning to get the full game very soon!!! And the graphics are really cool too, I imagine a very dark ninja game in that envyroment, could be really awesome!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	I think this deserves more of an 8.0 or 8.5. I have it and the control is fine given the genre. The camera control is absolutely superb and adds SOOOO much to the game it isn't even funny. The game controls sort of like older RE games or maybe older Silent Hill but that interactive Camera is solid, responsive and pretty much done perfectly, it adds a sense of immersion to the game that otherwise is not there with dual stick. The 3rd person control is just for getting from place to place. The action really happens with the Gyros.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	"This game is great, and the use of the gamepad actually works flawless. And I really don't get what they mean by repetitive encounters as every ghost are unique whit a unique way of attacking, they even put in the ability to touch each fallen ghost (if you're fast enought) and see their memories of how they died.
I also think this game have by far the best graphic I ever seen in game. They even bother by small details like if you get wet when you go under a waterfall or fall in water you're clothes actually also gets wet.
This is a solid horror game and a must for any Wii U owner."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	@robert.wahlstrom  Have you been living under a rock for awhile.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	"This is great! Drenched in atmosphere and a very twisted story. While I dig 4's setting a bit more, I'm loving how they kicked up the morbidity in 5. Personally an 8.5 for me.
It's not for everyone but I highly suggest checking out the first couple chapters for free. You'll know after that if you'll dig the rest"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	This is one thing I wish I had bought a Wii U for.  Seems so much more intriguing than Until Dawn.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	Some people seem to be overreacting to the digital only option.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	@MrDanMan I agree. If that is your only reason for not purchasing it you have yourself to blame if Nintendo decides to shelve the series. Digital is a safer option and is a great way to gauge interest. While I would have preferred a physical release, I have no doubt that Nintendo knows this is a niche series. I would rather digital than not at all. Sure it may mean you need an external. But you can get a 500gb external relatively cheap these days. I had a 1TB laying around after I moved all my Steam games to my 2TB external. All I had to do was buy a Y-cable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/19/fatal-frame-maiden-of-the-black-water-review	Are you stupid? If the series is cancelled it would be strictly Nintendo's fault. Digital on a Nintendo console is far from the safer option, considering the hassle it is to get your games if something happens.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	The real reason this game got 7.8 is because of these water maps in the game. We all know IGN doesn't mix well with water.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	"""The first and most welcome change is its open world.""
You're an idiot, you obviously never actually played Tales games before? They're all open world, and until you get near the end most but not all previous one's are very linear yes. But this one isn't much different, you can explore the whole area maps from the start. But you can do the same in graces f, vesperia, xillia 1&2 as well, even tales of the abyss back on ps2. Anywhere you've reached in the story in any of them you can walk back to anytime you want.
This isn't the first to be open world, you're either arrogant and commenting about games you've never played, or arrogant for using terms you don't know what they mean.
Why are you writing reviews when you make it so obvious you have no idea what you're doing or what you're talking about."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	"The amount of hoops I've had to jump through to download Vesperia on 360 ( usually a ps man) .

Better be worth it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	Started out liking this but got bored of it. Gameplay is a little too simple. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	"Yeah, try fighting the big fights without armatizing though. The last boss fight part 1 and 2 before losing that ability. As well as the dark turtle boss in katz korner end game. Those aren't simple without armatization, the dark turtle boss especially. He's actually impossible without it, and the final boss fight part 2 you have to pull off a set amount of damage before you can sacrifice an arma, so if you didn't power lvl before you'll die because the option won't pop out for the gun.
End game is much harder though. The game up until the end is easy, unless you suck at video games. Part 2 of final boss fights is the hardest of the parts if you didn't grind otherwise it's easy.
But the hardest 2 bosses are edna's brother, and dark turtle. Heldalf is a noob in comparison. Those two bosses are a dozen times steonger, they hit very constantly, and they can wipe out 75%+ hp if they use their best attacks. Edna's brother is lvl 80 and has more health than almost every fight of the final boss parts combined. He hits more, faster.
But dark turtle is the strongest boss despite his significantly lower health and defenses. He never stops moving more than about 2 seconds, he's alway spamming whoever you control, his attacks can take out about a thousand each little combo he does, his best skill can do as much as 7000 to a character if you're unprepared for it. Even if your prepared and lvled and geared he puts up more of a fight than anything else."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	@kevin25b Appreciate your enthusiasm. I dived deep to platinum Graces f, the Xillias, did a little for Hearts but don't have the time to do the same for this. Happy there's such a level for this game (Y).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	I'm one of those players who plays for the story and characters, especially in non-FPS games.  Sadly, Zestiria's characters and story are extremely boring and cliche.  You have the cliche main hero who has absolutely no personality aside from being the most pure and naive goody two-shoes.  The rest of the characters easily fall within genre tropes.  Which is unfortunate since the gameplay itself is pretty fun.  The combat system is decently entertaining (though not without it's own flaws) and the overall feel of the game is decent.  If you like Tales combat and don't mind a boring story and cliche characters then play the game, otherwise its definitely a pass.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	News flash, every rpg game has cliche characters. And by your standards every video game character has no personality. If these ones have no personality to you, you need to look up the word since you obviously don't know what it means. They have personality, but you obviously didn't pay attention to the talking at all. Every video game character is designed with a personality, some might be less believable or really annoying or any of the above or below. But theirs no such thing as a character without personality, you just either don't know what the word means. Or you didn't pay enough attention to talking which is a constant in rpgs even more so in jpgs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	is there romance ?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	Hi fellow players!   I have been playing on the PS4 version and my hunny wanted to join.  It says that it is a 1-2 player game but how can I get him to play with me?  Do I have to buy the PS3 version and join through our PSN Accounts? Hoping that there is a much easier way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	I'm basing this off when I played tales of symphonia but ... Set up a second controller and then he can control a character during the battle phases . There also may be an option for it in the settings.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	"I literally just received this in a prize package from Crunchyroll not even 10 minutes ago. I wouldn't have purchased it otherwise but I'm excited to try it out. 

How easy is this game to understand if you're pretty familiar with RPG's?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	Kind of funny that one of the cons is what 90% of people play tales games for, the story. To non tales fans no story might warrant the 7.8 rating, but to tales fans, the horrible story brings the rating to about a 3/10. One of the worst yet
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	"@KuramaArctica Speak for yourself, and take your No True Scotsman fallacy out of here. There are plenty of fans that play it for the battle system alone. And in that sense, Zestiria stands out once you get over the myriad quirks and additions to it.

The story is no doubt a weak point- but let's face it, the story in all Tales games is fundamentally similar to a large degree. Were you expecting something different than the usual ""gather the elements"" and corrupt religious organization at this point?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	"Just played a couple of hours and I still cant believe this is yet another stereo game, wtf is wrong with japanese rpg's, stereo, WTF.

The combat system is a freking headpain, why do you have to press L2 in order for your char run around normal during the battle, it just stupid, and that locking system is also a mojor crap, it shout target the closeste enemy and you could use it to select another, but insted you get a lock on a random enemy that some times is far and when you press the ataque botton the player runs to its locked target and gets hit by all other enemies on screen, terrible battle system.

And those grafics are so freking weak no proper texture, it plain objects every were no real 3D deapht in anything."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/16/tales-of-zestiria-review	@Imortu.San It's not that L2 freerun is a hindrance but the fact that it alllllways halts your AC/SC recovery. It's been like that for heck knows how long, with exceptions in other games such as Skills which allow a bypass. But that penalty being in this game is so bad because the overall combat is slower than normal and not as dynamic as Graces f. The options to overcome this is not as rewarding or obvious as something like Xillia when using Jude, etc etc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	 i some what agree this game is pretty simple and pretty basic an sometimes a little annoying, like how you can't run through a dungeon without having to go back to the freakin ship, but it is over all fun i just wish i could find actual walk throughs instead of video's i really couldn't care less about other's opinion's,lol, no offense but i'm sure some if not most of you feel the same way, this is probably more a game for teens or kids, then adults but it looked fun so i brought it,lol, i'm overall happy with it, i'd give at least a 7 maybe 8 but then again i'm an adult a teen might rate it more
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	@mentalmichelle I would say this game is for Dragon Quest fans. I love the Dragon Quest series and I am looking forward to this on the Nintendo Switch.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	I finally picked it up on the PSN sale. As an old Dynasty Warriors fan, this brings some new flavor. Great artwork, and fun gameplay. I give it a 9.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	I'm loving this game so far. As good as Hyrule Warriors.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	"I hate to say it, but now I can see the reasoning behind why Tom was laid off from Gamespot, as well as a few others.  Going through the GS comments on certain reviews he did, it seems as if he wants to be ""controversial"" in his reviews, and not only that, but attempts to bring social issues into the game via the review and really, its a game and really does not need social commentary at all pigeonholed into it.  Games are meant to be fun and are not meant to be a commentary on society."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	"First off, I disagree with the reviewer. That said, why is everyone in the comments section such an asshole? ""Wait, your opinion doesn't line up with mine?? Then f*** you, bruh.""

Also, who the f&#@ let the psycho-extreme pacifist review this game? This review is saturated in whiney political correct nonsense that isn't even applicable to the context it's trying to skewer.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/14/dragon-quest-heroes-the-world-trees-woe-and-the-blight-below-review	IGN seems to hate all games except the CoD, Madden, and 2K franchises. You guys gave WWE 2K16 an 8.8 and that game was so full of bugs and glitches that it was virtually unplayable for the first 11 days after release. You got to play the pre-patched copies and made no mention of any of the literal game breaking glitches, freezes, etc. It's hard to believe it has nothing to do with kickbacks or anything.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	freaking love this game!! The haunting music, the atmosphere .. stories and combat. It's got the whole package
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	Seriously IGN. What's up with these force-fed Fallout 4 ads on every single article? You can't pause them or turn them off, you have to listen to that shit until it disappears. It's getting really fukin annoying
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	I find that I'm enjoying this game despite feeling like the toughest opponent in the game is the control scheme. While the setting and storyline are entertaining, the controls on PS4 are frustrating to say the least.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	I like this game. but, on the PS4 version, it tends to crash after being on for a while. It's crashed about 10 times for me over the weekend... Other than that, the game has really held up well with time!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@AWBloise Yeah, they had a memory leak glitch. It's been fixed now if anyone was letting that put them off; plus it's on sale on the PSN store for a tiny price compared to the amount of game you're getting.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	This game is the shiznit. Any fan of old school CRPG's owes it to themselves to pick this up and Divinity Original Sin: Enhanced Edition. It's a good time to be a gamer. You younger folks might not dig it. Probably too complicated. :D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	Love this game. Bought it on steam from the last sale they had, and it's one of the best games I've ever played. Not sure its worth another buy on ps4, but if anyone out there hasn't played this game then I would highly recommend it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	Fuck it released already? I remember reading they were going to do something for those of us that bought it on PC if we wanted to go console, anybody have info on that?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	So if you had to choose between Wasteland 2 and Divinity Original Sin... which one is the better game? Can only really get one of them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@T1o9n9y1 Wasteland 2 is a really good game, especially after that director's cut update. But Divinitiy Original Sin... Amazing game... I think it's the best of this genre. And the Divinity also will get an update like this one on 27th October. They will add too much things which i like most is local co-op with split screen. If you don't mind fantasy set up instead of post apocalyptic setup, you must buy Divinity :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@lie_coffin @T1o9n9y1 Cheers for the advice. I'll get Divinity on the 27th. It does look amazing. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@T1o9n9y1 @lie_coffin Having played both, I would honestly say, buy whichever you feel like is better, then get the other one when you feel to travel the wasteland again, though since Fallout 4 is right around the corner.... In any case, you don't lose with either game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	"@lie_coffin @T1o9n9y1  I'm in my late 30's and enjoy both because it takes me back to the golden age of RPGs on the PC. I enjoyed Wasteland 2 simply because I enjoy post apocalyptic settings but viewing it as objectively as possible I would go with Divinity Original Sin unless your saving money because Divinity costs about $20 more. (At least on Xbox One)

Boulders Gate Series = Divinity
Fallout Series = Wasteland"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@T1o9n9y1 of course u need both. wasteland isnt full full price..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@T1o9n9y1 I own both and I love both. Both games are very similar, but I like Wasteland a little bit better. Don't get me wrong, Divinity is a great game but I just like the whole post apocalyptic theme. Also not sure if its just me or what but the combat in Wasteland feels a little bit faster and less time consuming than Divinity. If you like baldurs gate then get Divinity, if you like Fallout then get Wasteland 2.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	"I TRADED THIS GAME IN. Im usually the guy that likes mostly every game a little bit AT LEAST such as the infamous: Order Of 1886 & Unity.. anyhow.. it has nothing to do with the over the top camera angle.. the fact it's ""old school"" its just not presented very well.. from the start of the game.. i was reaching to care.. i was really reaching.. i even fell out of my chair that's how far i reached.. i have no problem with a game being difficult either.. but when the game starts off giving you the middle finger the first few minutes.. that's a problem.. i think they should have let you gradually get hooked.. then cranked the toughness up.. the game has potential.. but I'm gonna go with a big fat PASS!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@TheChopStickJr I understand your angle, but I realized after a few hours that your characters do start off rather weak. But once you get some good weapons and power your team up, it gets really fun. It's my fav game of the year, it's slow and makes you stop and think a lot which I appreciate. But I can see how a person wouldn't want to play it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/wasteland-2-directors-cut-review	@IdentityCrisis9 @TheChopStickJr i wouldn't say i never want to play it again.. but there's just too many games coming out for me to focus on a single game that i only like a little.  maybe later on down the year when there's nothing to play.. it'll serve as my filler

The game has 80% approval on Steam from people who bought it, which is pretty good.  I think that score is deserved, and it is an accurate indication of the quality of the game.

If you ask me, there is some sort of ""troll campaign"" against the game, because negative reviews have been voted up (by people who might not have bought the game).  Valve should take another look at how they determine whether reviews are ""helpful"" or not."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/minecraft-story-mode-episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone-review	@Prologue For me, the Telltale games are perfect when you're stuck on an airplane ride.  I haven't played this game so I won't challenge your review, but I would recommend waiting until more episodes are released to call the story lame.  That's one area Telltale excels at in my opinion.  I too thought the first episode of The Wolf Among Us was a lame story, until I kept going and it got better and better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/minecraft-story-mode-episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone-review	"I liked it. It seems like its building towards an adventure with serious consequences. Not an easy act for a game with a mixed age audience and no previous story.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/13/minecraft-story-mode-episode-1-the-order-of-the-stone-review	why did thets game got 7.3 noooooooooooooooo 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	"This game doesn't have crappy loot, crappy loot applies for easy difficulty, and when you raise the difficulty, you get much better loot. That's how it is done, and how it SHOULD be done. Because if you get awesome weapons at first glance, the game becomes to easy or boring, right? So, the negative of ""crappy loot"" is irrelevant."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	So many typos in this article. But the game is honestly very well done.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	"An excellent game. I would have personally given it an 8.4 or so. Definitely ""great"" not just ""good"" status."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	I really enjoyed this game and completed it twice.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	"In the review, when one of them said "".... at least we get to bust some decepti-chops"" I clicked off and kept scrolling..... loll "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	I'd go a lil higher on the score: 8.5. This game should have had some more features and some more Transformers. The controls could be a bit tighter. Also, I hope Omega Supreme makes some kind of appearance. He is Devastator's archnemesis. That said, the base game is great! Any fan of G1 Transformers should have this in the collection...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	"@BromegaSupreme Not even close...The game is a 6 at best...The moment you pull your head out of your ass and take off the nostalgia glasses, its a hollow mediocre poor man's Bayonetta rip-off flat out....The game is ONLY worth 20 bucks at best, with the 5 characters that all share the same shit, have ZERO variety between them and you can max out that pathetic LMAO move list in the first 10 minutes.

Its so annoying when people pump up garbage because of nostalgia glasses...Another Platinum mediocre title..Maybe IF it gets a sequel they could improve it but I dont have a whole lot of hope Platinum are the kings of 3hr games that all flop, with the exception of Revengance and it only sold because of the name on the box, and I was the kid that was collecting Transformers in 84, nostalgia only stretches so far."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	@Deadpoolio316 @BromegaSupreme  well said DEADPOOLIO..they need DLC and expansion...this is like the first release of destiny in needs so much more...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	Hey moneyman, there was nothing well said about the derp with a mouth's rant. Its fine to disagree, but dude went about it all wrong. Most of his complaints about the game, I addressed, without showing my foreskin. You cosigning him telling me to get my head out my ass because I don't share his view? Cause if you are, fuck you, too, and fuck you two...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	"@BromegaSupreme lol.  And what's so funny about his rant is that he obviously bought this game because he was wearing his ""I collected Transformers in 84"" Nostalgia Glasses that he's telling everyone else to take off.  Hey @Deadpoolio316, you obviously bought this game because of nostalgia, bitch.  So some people get caught up in the nostalgia and others are disappointed (like you obviously)  why can't you just say ""I disagree, I didn't like it that much"" and move on, instead of transforming into a deceptidouche over it. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	@BromegaSupreme Hey Bromega...Just want to say I agree with you 100%.  I actually have just become aware of this game...so I apologize if I am responding to a thread that is very much in the past.  I just would like to say...even if you love this game because off the nostalgia...if that makes the game good for you than why is that not enough?  I still have yet to play it and am excited to do so.  I guess my point is that Mr. Deadpolelicker, as you stated is not the end all, be all of reviewers.  And if the nostalgia is the primary reason you love the game, so what?  So long as you like it...for what ever the reason...it is a good game...at least to you.  However I think you put him in his place quite well.  Respect! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	@Mikelface Thanks. I wanted either of them to respond. Ah well. Enhoy the game...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/transformers-devastation-review	@BromegaSupreme I know these comments are old(I just came here cuz I'm thinking of buying Devastation cuz it's on sale) & I missed the argument completely & you'e obviously moved on but don't sweat the dickheads.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	I'm new to PC gaming and built my first PC yesterday ..... anyone played this game on 21:9 monitor ? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	Just finished this DLC today, and WOW! pretty darn great! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	Some of the greatest story telling I've seen in any game, and this is coming from a DLC. The way it slowly unravels these interesting characters, which implores us as gamers to put the pieces together. The team they have over at CD projekt red simply understand everything about how to make a successful RPG, and I applaud them for showing other developers how to truly create a work of art. I hope the witcher can live on in some form, even now that they have moved on to their new projects.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	I'm just about to start this and then on to Blood Wine (short break to play DS3 and Uncharted 4). Really excited by all of the Wows down below. The Witcher series, especially W3 are just such fantastic RPG gaming. Really does take me away. I'm an old guy too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	"Finished this over the weekend. Excellent piece of DLC, CDPR showing class once again. 
This is one of the best pieces of DLC you can possibly attain for money they priced it at. Great storyline, Boss Battles and New Characters, O'dim in particular, creepy as hell and incredibly powerful.

That Nursery rime that some of the kids sing whenever you bump into a few of em in a settlement is forever in my mind, straight up freddy krueger shit lol. Good Stuff."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	@MazorCutthroat The new 'Blood and wine' expansion looks even better with a brand new area and twice as much content for the same price
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	As an older guy, not a youngster I have really enjoyed the Witcher Series.  I also think this DLC hearts of stone is great, however I do have a couple gripes.  Not deal breakers but gripes regardless.The first one is that the Viper gear is so easy to miss.  I missed it as the old lady after you search for her ring and find it does not exist, then tells you to leave her alone with her thoughts. So one does not get any indication that you need to continue to pester her until she presents a for sale menu. So you get kicked out of the auction without knowing anything is for sale. So you miss the chance and become aware of this only after the fact research. However the gear you get from the merchant is just about as good.The other gripe is the better steel and silver sword , weIl never got to level 39 and you cannot use the swords until level 39. So what is the point? All quests done and nothing more to do and still not level 39. Lessons learned, do not worry about better gear or better sworrds, simply upgrade what you have with the runewright and play.  You will be fine with that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	@Kit5854 Haven't finished the game yet, but my brother in law told me that you can go high level with the game + option (which I haven't tested yet). Probably possible to get to that level with this option, where you start at level 30 (or higher if you imported a higher caracter)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	"You never made it to level 39???
What the hell were you doing?
I was level 36 when I beat the original portion of the game. Getting to 39 was a breeze in this DLC. Sounds to me you not only rushed through the DLC (not exploring ALL dialogue choices before going to the yellow ones this missing the Viper gear) but also the main game as well."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/08/the-witcher-3-hearts-of-stone-review	What level required to play the expansion?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	This review is BULLSHIT. I have been playing 2k for the last few years but will never buy 2k again as I love nba live now. Don't listen to review. Sounds like the person reviewing the game is shit at the game. Defence is easy and it's not hard to steal the ball. Also the game does not lag. And the faces are updated all the time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	NBA 2K16 lets me relocate the Sonics back to Seattle. Enough said.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	This NBA Live review is so far off.  Who is this guy?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	2k is so fake and corny. I dont care how all the wannabees clammer to whatever has the best tv commercials and presentation. 2k gameplay sucks and has always sucked and so do their online servers. Live has been terrible too but 16 is much better than the last few live games. EA needs to expand the Pro Am and make is like fifa pro clubs or nhl eashl so that people can make teams and run leagues. 16 is a step in the right direction for sure and I cant wait for something better to knock 2k because I am so tired of playing that fake excuse for an nba game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	"@Hatch1182 YES!!!!!!!!

Oh how I wish LIVE would bring back coop with teams and divisions. 16 is a step in the right direction.

People also don't realize 2K you can pay REAL MONEY to get VC, and use it to upgrade your player.  Those who pre-ordered 2K get 35,000 VC.

35,000 VC!!!!!!!!! THATS CRAZY!

Plus you can BUY MORE with $$$$.  Then just upgrade your players stats.

You can't do that in ProAm or Rising Star for your Player.  You earn the XP in NBA Live 16 by playing and getting better.

2K has pay-$$$-to-get-XP"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	EA is getting on my nerves now. STOP trying to make a realistic basketball simulation game. Use the NBA license you have and make a NBA Street game or something else. 2K is too far ahead to catch up...your wasting everyone's time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	@DLPthe2ND I really don't understand why they abandoned the street series.

I have 2k. the way he describes this is almost or lackluster to the problems wit 2k. at least it feels like they devloping a new game every year. give EA a break, cause you guys ride Madden jock all day every day, when NFL 2K been blew it out the park when they had that out back in the day. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	"Ign . 
Nba live is more simple in terms of setting, bottoms, offense and defance. 
Nba live has no lag and no zone authorization  network. As 2k
2k is too much complicated and too much for a game.
This year nba live around 8 . And I prefer to play this game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	too bad they didn't review the game post patch. They added a nice patch late last week that fixed a lot of the gameplay issues. I feel it's pretty good. More like a 7.5. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	"As a guy in the UK who used to love playing and watching basketball, in my 30's I find 2K so inaccessible compared to NBA Live. To be honest, I don't play either as much as I want to because they've got so complex since the days of Total NBA - my favourite ever Bball game.
I just want a simple game but don't know which to buy or try!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/nba-live-16-review	"I'm in the exact same boat.
I can play 2K. It's a good game. But man it's sooo similar to every other years release. Like seriously back to back with even 2008 till now, it's been like 8 releases of a very similar game. That ""players running in mud"" feel with random steal presses that don't do anything but yield a random foul.
My favourite game, and I reckon it would be so good now with online as well, would be a Run and Gun basketball game.
Think Run and Gun 2 (by Konami for those who have heard of it) but modernised with big new graphics and frame rates but with that split second timing of blocks dunks and alley oops. Seriously it would be soo good.
I can't by this 2K game anymore - and I'm the biggest basketball fan out. I just came back from watching a heap of games in the states, but if I have to spend $80 one more time on the same game that literally has the same commentary even year to year bar a few phrases I'm going to kill someone. Ps I have the Xb1 and Ps4 so someone please Make it"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	Really enjoying this on my Switch.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	This game is ruining my life. 10/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	Just beat this game myself and it is the best in the Disgaea series in my opinion. It does so many things right and it improves on the series so much and the story is just great
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	"I'm sure this is great for people who are into it, but there's no way I could be bothered to mess about with THAT much stuff.
For me, an RPG's battle system is a complement to the story. In this series, the battle system is the only thing worth mentioning."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	@Nudvik you havn't played a Disgaea in your life if you think the leveling system is the only thing worth playing... The story is cheesy and fun as hell. Every character feels different and includes new dimention
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	"@Nudvik That is what made me stop playing Disgaeas too. Yeah, earning stats is fun, but what if the story is pure nonsense, the characters are annoying and I don't care about them at all? Playing just for numbers? Excuse me.
I absolutely loved 1st Disgaea's story and characters, they were the best (before later series ruined all their development) and I invested so much time to raise their stats, make them stronger...because I cared for them.
The second Disgea was great too, and when the 3rd came out I couldn't wait to play it...But it dissapointed me so much. I shut the game after comleting the story  mode and never played it again.
4th...Graphics are improved, new features, looks so promising... Again, I couldn't play it for long. Valvatorez is a great MC, but I hate 4th Disgaea for what they did to Flonne. Artina and Fuka were annoying. Disgaea's world became even more nonsensical and the story just couldn't make me care for the characters/ 
This one, I don't even want to buy. Watched some letsplays on Youtube, Killia looks like a very generic and shallow character with VENGEANCE obsession and pink-haired lady is just a definition of annoying bitch. NO way. 
And ths is dissapointing."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	"@Zhamka @Nudvik You like the 1st Disgaea for its story and characters yet you judge this one to be ""disappointing"" even though you know nothing of the story and characters. You based your opinion on just a tidbit of youtube videos and spend paragraphs slamming the game you know essentially nothing about. Talk about judging a book by its covers. You sir are the one that's ""generic and shallow."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	I usually wait for the portable versions of these games to come out as I feel they are more suited on the go, but looking at the state of the Vita I'm doubting that will happen...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/06/disgaea-5-alliance-of-vengeance-review	This series has never really been about the story and characters, it's a weird thing to say for an eph but it's all bout the battles, the characters are always annoying as hell.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	I was a huge RB fan, own every title including the AC/DC and more money on DLC than I will admit.  Waiting for them to finish the product before I jump in, it sounds unfinished and is leaving me meh
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	@sofalover It was rushed, but it's still fun, just not as fun as RB3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	dlc is to make mediocre games good thats all i see it as. games are a waste of money in my opinion of course if you can afford an extra £40 for a season pass
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	"Overall i am happy with the game. Alot people are disappointed in the lack of prior features but for the most part i dont really care about most of those. There are only things i did not really care for are.

1. No online play - While i did not use it much in the past and it would not be a deal breaker for me, i do feel it is an important feature that should be added.

2. No song stats - This feels like an oversight honestly that will hopefully be remedied in the patch in December as it is annoying not seeing my stats after playing

3. The semi-transparent chart - It is a problem because it feels like it shrinks the chart down a bit and makes it harder to see the incoming notes in a reasonable time

4. The Set-list is meh - I feel it is about the same as RB3 overall. RB3 had more really good songs like ""Beast and the Harlot"", ""Freebird"", ""25 or 6 to 4"", ""Caught in the Mosh"", ""Crazy Train"", ""Before i Forget"", ""Crosstown Traffic"" and ""Bohemian Rhapsody"" (probably one my favorite songs eve) but it also had some the worst songs in the series like ""Oye Mi Amor"", ""The Killing Moon"" and ""Rehab"" (screw Amy Whinehouse, now your dead, perhaps rehab would been a good idea afterall). RB4 is just ok through out and not man song stick one way or the other. RB1 and RB2 are far superior setlists"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	"Garbage....what a waste of money.  First off, if you HAVE to have this game, just get the guitar bundle, it's easily the most fun of the three instruments.  But turn the ""solo"" option off...it's a total waste and is just going to end up breaking the equipment due to it's call for straight button mashing with no rhyme or reason.  Plus, you'll save 100$. The mic is miserable...it's lag is almost a full second behind when you speak into it, which makes the singing option NOT an option.  There's also an effect on the mic that cannot be changed.  So not only is it slow to respond, the effect combined with the lag makes for an ""echo in a cave"" feel...it really is so bad you can't even use it.  The drums are completely garbage.  After calibrating literally over a dozen times, they still lag like crazy.  The kick pedal can't handle double taps in quick succession, causing repeated drop notes.  And even though this can be frustrating, it's not the worst part.  I don't know who was responsible for transcribing the drum beats into the software but they whiffed BIG TIME.  There are beats in the game that aren't in the real songs...and the random ""Drum Solos"" are a joke...do yourself a favor and turn that option off.  If you have no clue how to play the drums, that probably won't bother you as much as the lag compensation.  However, if you do play real drums, as I do, the inaccuracy of the songs will drive you absolutely ape isht.  I fully realize this is a game and the goal is to give the consumer the ""feeling"" of playing in band and is in no way meant to be the real thing....that said, I think the least you could expect would be accurate translations of the music into the game...and it falls well short of this.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	Ok this is the final time I'm coming here. Look at this review then look at guitar heros. You will notice it has almost the EXACT same criteria yet the point difference is large. Your reviews are so blatantly included by an outside factor. I followed you guys for a long time and I refuse to anymore. Suck a dick!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	Yeah fuck IGN for a lot of reasons; pushing their political bullshit is my main concern, but their reviews of these 2 games they actually got right. Rock Band is better, always has been. Get over it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	@TooKoolswag Just wait until you can no longer use any of the features like GHTV once the next game comes out. They'll keep forcing iterations on you yearly. Rock Band 4 is this generation's Rock Band, and supports the majority of previous DLC/exported music. That alone is worth the number difference, and when you take into account that Harmonix is working to upgrade the game based on fan input, then Rock Band is definitely better. This being said, I do agree that based on their criteria the games scores are a bit iffy, but that is IGN in general.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	@TooKoolswag It's almost as if the reviews were done by two different people. What a dunce... 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/05/rock-band-4-review	"8.8
bwahahaha
if you enjoyed all the features of rb4.
you can upgrade to rb2.
band battles
decent set list
duels
high score notification
endless customization
fluid animation
perfect calibration
rb3 was also a downgrade to rb2 but at least it tried.
dont get on to me about keys or pro mode. its still an arcade rythm game. youre not signing a deal with defjams. plus guitarsmith filled that niche market.
that keyboard reminds me of the old nes powerglove only a few devout players had, but no one gave a crap about."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	This is not a long waiting return to Tony Hawks Pro Skater Series.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	Boy, am I glad I dodged this bullet. Bring on Project: Session.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	It all comes to this - we need Neversoft, only they can recapture the charm and genuine character the early THPS games had.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	Neversoft closed a couple years ago.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	I grew up playing Tony Hawks games. It didn't once occur to me to check the reviews online for THPS5 cause i was so sure it would be just as good if not better than the old school ones. I've played for half an hour this morning and I'm actually gutted. The graphics/aesthetics threw me off immediately and something didnt feel right. I paused it and googled it and found an abundance of bad reviews. I'm kinda angry at myself but like i said, ive never checked before, especially with games i have history with (Lesson learned) I plan on contacting GAME today to see what can be done in terms of returning it, Im not optimistic but I can only try.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	"So I just got this game earlier from Redbox......  It was supposed to be a free rental and it even said $0.00 when swiping my card, but somehow charged me anyways.  So that's the first bad news....I actually had to pay $3.20 to rent this game!!  I got it because growing up Pro Skater 4 was my FAVORITE game.  I'd play every single day for hours and hours.  I had high hopes with this because it is 2016 and compared to the other games out now for Xbox One I though ""omg this game is going to look AMAZING...I can almost imagine how much cool new customization modes they'll add and how awesome the graphics will look""....was I wrong.  This game is terrible.  Sure it's online multiplayer, but where's my customization and why do the characters look like it's still 2002.  I can customize my character in Sims 4 more than this!!!  I feel like it could still be good.  They need to really fix this game.  I want to make my own boards, my own characters (not just with lame presets where everyone's character will look the same).  It's 2016 now....embrace the technology you have at your fingertips and if you can't do it hire someone who can!!!!!  huge fail and DEFINITELY a missed opportunity.  2/10"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	Looks like they didn't even try to make this game, a mod creator could've made a better job. Thank god I got a free rental from redbox, would've been pissed if I had to pay for it. So sad, it used to be such a good game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	"Honestly, I would have been disappointed even if this was a $15 offering in the Xbox digital storefront. Everything the reviewer says is 100% dead on. This is one of the buggiest games I have played the last 2 generations running. The levels are incredibly bland and that slam move, and the mapping of it button wise, was just a piss poor idea. If this is going back to the basics then I don't ever want to play another game again that attempts to do this. 

I always keep my games (the collector in me) and can count on one hand the number of games I have sold used the last 3 generations. The generation there has only been 2 thus far, Destiny and Tony Hawk 5. I drove to my local Gamestop as fast as possible to get rid of this garbage. Do yourself a huge favor and stay FAR away from this game. The only way I can recommend buying this is if it drops to $2.99 and your a HUGE skating fan just dying to check it out. Everyone else, just stay away and spend your money elsewhere. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	I don't know why this game got bad reviews.  It gives every fan what they want.  A game that looks like Tony Hawk went to DeVry University and got an associates in programming and programmed the game himself.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	This game is not that bad at all.You need to play missions to get more shit to sk8. I like it and its well worth the $60! Thanks
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/10/02/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5-review	Tony Hawk is like a skateboard Hitler.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	I've never played any of these games but am considering buying this. However, I'm pretty picky about games and not really sure I'd enjoy this. Are there any comparable series out there that I may have played to relate this to? I can get this for $20 so it might be worth the risk even if I don't like it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	Can you recommend this to a person who didn't like Uncharted 1? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	Boring & pointless to buy. Nvr cared 4 uncharted. Played some of 3 & 2. Even if I WAS a fan, I'd have no reason to buy this game. The review just told me that there is no thieves end, there is no Uncharted 4. Review just told me it is a HD remaster of the very boring Uncharted series. So...Even if I were a fan of Uncharted, I have can play all 3 Uncharted games on PS+. Why the fuck would anyone, in their right mind, care to buy Uncharted HD Remastered.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	"A Vince Ingenito review.   That's too bad, these games deserve better, no one should listen to this hack and what he says about any game.  This guy gave evolve a 9.  

I'm finishing up the 3rd game in this collection and wow, this is the longest movie ever.  Games are fun and yes the graphics are amazing (for the time they were made), but seriously there's tons of long cutscenes, and the gameplay is incredibly repetitive.  They're enjoyable games but compared to what's available for gaming these days they're more like a 7/10 than 9/10.  But like I said, Vince Ingenito."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	"I might have done this wrong.  Played Uncharted 4 first and loved it.  Now I am starting these and the first Uncharted is a real chore to play....

Still.....love it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	@splurge1015 I enjoyed it when it first came out, but basically everyone says the first is a chore to play through now.  It gets TONS better when you hit 2 and 3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	@splurge1015 agreed. The controls killed me. They got better in 2 and 3 , but 4 is still the most smooth version of the 3. I found myself falling off cliffs and mistiming jumps a lot in U1

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	@evyatararbell123 They literally have no Multiplayer options, which sucks because I wanted survival mode in U3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/30/uncharted-the-nathan-drake-collection-review	The one thing that disappoints me is the lack of multiplayer. They only put the single player modes in (don't get me wrong, they are fantastic). I wanted to play multiplayer with the new gunplay and graphics. Oh well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	"After putting a lot of time into it myself I want to say:

1) NBA games look AMAZING on here
2) Story mode could have been cool, but it makes all your major choices for you except your college & the family could seem very weird if your player looks nothing like them
3) Loading times are painful and made me stop playing a couple of times
4) Getting enough currency to level up your character and teams is a GRIND & the ever available ""Pay to Win"" is frustrating
5) It is NOT an easy game to pick up and succeed, which I'm fine with, but think people should know

I would give it a 7.8 and suggest rent, don't buy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	This is a totally paid for review. NBA2K16 is by far the biggest pile-o-crap. The game itself is broken and has been since launch. Games like this and Madden have become a cash cow that releases glitched, broken, garbage games and charges $60+ for a game that is nothing more than a lower end Beta. They patch minor issues and ignore the bigger ones in hopes they can just rush out another broken game and the sheeple will rush to buy it in hopes that it will be better than the crap they just dealt with in the previous game. Both EA and 2K should have a class action lawsuit filed on them for selling an unfinished product the contradicts their advertised promo. And this review is 100% untruthful. Enough is enough. Stop insulting the customer base you should be representing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	This is the most trash bullshit game ever, simply the worst game of sports history, maybe of all time, the gamplay itself is just an unplayable game, the shot is broken, the crossovers broken, when playing the cpu it makes it worst specially in hall of fame you can play the best defense in the world and still the cpu is going to make the shot no matter what... please if your reading this do NOT buy this game is a waste of time and money
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	This is the worst sports video game (not named madden) in the history of sports video games. Dribbling is broken, passing is broken, shooting percentages and shots taken by computer don't make any sense. Rebounding is laughable. Players feet don't move when doing very easy tasks. Absolutely horrible.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	NBA2K16 Online game play is the worst it has ever been. It's completely computer scripted. Too many unforced turnovers and way too many cheesers this year. There is like 4 new glitch moves that everyone uses. Most people chuck 3s all game, but for the people who like to play a Simulated game, it is wonderful until the CPU decides to make your hot team all of a sudden go ice cold and allow the other team to make a run and get back into the game and even win. The momentum factor is up way too high. Somehow a center can magically beat everyone back on the fast break for a computer block shot. It's unreal. The graphics continue to get better, but the game play gets worse and worse every season. 2K16 also changed the controls yet again, so instead of a steal button, it is now the intentional foul button and it gets in the way of your game. I give NBA 2K16 3 stars out of 5.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	After playing couple months I threw it away. It simply started to piss me off. Why it is impossible to turn off those pre-game/post-game shows, time out flashes and other unnecessary stuff? I want to play basketball not to look to repeating videos. All this stuff is fun to watch for the first game, then I want to turn it off. Sometimes player control is incomprehensible. Players most of the time act dumb and are always making lots of unnecessary moves and at some situations it is simply doesn't match reality. Why always my player in my career has to wave hands, shout and do other ridiculous stuff after hitting almost every basket? Even if his team is loosing by 25 and his fg's are 2/20. Now, my career episodes were shallow, smelled racist and looked idiotic when I created any other player except black. Remove all that Spike Lee's movie and leave school/college/rookie year games. This is a game not a movie! All in all, very average 2k game, only thing that helps here were graphics. Let's hope that next series will be more about actually playing basketball.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	"You are totally right i am tanned skin and even i found it ridiculous as hell. I want more voice creation and a racial neutral story. I knew this crap was coming when they promoted Spike Lee as the writer/director. He always manages to pull the freaking race card even in a damn game this time.
I can make up a better story in 5 minutes: you start off as a street baller and you play for money, move on to win a couple of big name legal street basketball tournaments and take the bext step by trying out for the nba D league or overseas. After 1 season overseas or D league you end up in the NBA. DONE!
Also for petes sake add a larger variety of voices for character creation. 2k15 had 2 and 2k16 had 1. You are suposed to upgrade not downgrade
Have you also noticed how IGN always praises big company titles? I bet if i checked they even praised ubisofts the division into high heaven."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	I can truly see why this game was free on my PS plus account considering the free games are usually the ones you never want to fucking play anyway, but wtf, Ive played better 2k games on my Dreamcast, the graphics look great thats it, seriously that's the only thing, So much focus was placed on their new animations that they felt the need to fucking force them on you, so many times ive wanted to just drive to the basket but instead my player just sat there doing some dumb shit when all i wanted him to to do was move, they call making the game challenging by just making your players act completely fucking dumb.....If im double teamed 9 times out of 10 I will turn the ball over, wether the defensive players made an attempt to strip the ball or not, they dont even have to be facing me, my player just drops the ball,Ive never seen an NBA player just drop a ball.. It never feels like a game of basketball just a bunch of set pieces, I felt like I was playing a fucking RPG, also you cant avoid the double team no matter what, youll tell your player to go one way, but he wont, hell just go right into the double team just because its there... then when you pass the same defenders that were part of the double to team are able to run right over to the new ball handler, why the fuck does everything slow down when i make a pass yet the the CPU moves with complete fluidity ?? Seriously you guys should Ashamed, just like Madden they've lost work ethic because theyre the only NBA franchise game, I dont know how this made it past the game testers.... Horrible fucking game, oh the soundtrack it pretty good...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	Now I KNOW IGN is paid to give bullshit games good reviews. This game sucks. The animations fuck up your timing half the time. Of all the NBA2Ks, this is the worst... which is why it's FREE.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/nba-2k16-review	How do you give a game a 9+ review number and include the word mediocre in the review itself. My career one of my usually favorite modes is complete trash. I want to play 82 games of basketball, not have ten conversations and post game shows every game. The campaign is insanely rasict, spike lee seems to be attempting to fight rascism by portraying stereotypes of the black community. Not every one is an inner city black youth from harlem and not every one is rich greedy white guy. The my park which i played 3 games of showed all you have to do is pick the guy who can dunk and your gonna win 9/10 games. Yea you can shoot 3's but the new fatigue makes it limited and thats okay if ut were applied to the 7' centers running the inside too. The game shows how its impossible to play defense the majority of the time in a way except for standing in front if a guy, which isnt 2ks fault because its pretty accurate. I didnt play any other mode but if a noob player jumps in and this is their impression it deserves a 9+ rating? Oh yea my names not freq i chose my own name remember? And thats not it. Ign why do you prop up trash time and time again? Can't you hold yourself to the standard of actual serious gamers?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	"I can't believe no one ever acknowledges that the lego games have the most annoying feature on the planet and they have no intention of fixing it despite years of feedback.  There needs to be an option to turn off the ""FLASHING"" connect a second controller.  To have something just keep flashing during your whole game play that serves no purpose, ruins the whole game experience.  I will never buy a lego game again.  Until they provide an option to simply stop it from flashing, or an option to remove it.    Just do a search Lego flashing ""Connect controller""    I would give every lego game a score of one for never correcting the issue."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	Debating on getting this (on a pretty good sale right now). Would love to play the Doctor Who set, but for $30 for that set alone, not sure if it's worth it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	"Do I NEED to buy the ""level"" packs and use the stupid characters to play the Portal & BTTF levels or can I just play them all from the disc?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@protivakid yes if you want to play as Marty or Doc. The only 3 characters you get to play as with the starter kit are Batman, Wildstyle and Gandolf. There are levels for BTTF, Dr. Who, Ghostbusters etc. but you can't play as they characters without the packs. The level packs give you a bonus level and characters.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@Coop25 @protivakid Man, I'd really like to check out this game as an adult who loves BTTF & Portal but I cant bring myself to buy the game and all the packs. I'm looking at well over $100 for some probably mediocre levels

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	The game looks intriguing but is a blatant cash grab. Throwing in Doctor Who and some awesome characters wont change that. The game costs $100 to start and then additional characters would bring the total to $500. This is just another Infinity type game that tries to force parents to spend hundreds of dollars. I hope this model fails horribly in time. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	"@livewire34 Something about this one has my intrigue; I'm bit interested in it but a few holes seems to be holding me back from such a large investment.

The toy-to-life concept is great and really interesting, it's just at the early stages which pretty much don't offer much than spending a ton of money."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@Dilemma90 @livewire34 anything I can help with? I have the game and all but one character (sensei Wu) so I can answer any questions you may want to ask to help make your decision.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	I read an article on Kotaku that it would cost $465 to get all the content and characters for this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@applesngrapes More like $735, and that's from Amazon, not MSRP.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@applesngrapes I recently got a load of character packs in a 2 for 1 sale so I saved a lot of money but it would be very expensive to buy all the packs at full price. A bit too expensive imo even though me and my kids love the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	"I'm sorry to say but you can't rate the game worse because the puzzles aren't challenging enough. If you had actual common sense, you would understand that this is for younger audiences(children) and is not a Tomb Raider game. Have you not ever seen a child play a puzzle game? They'll end up being stuck in the same spot for years until their older sibling helps them.
And by the way, this game isn't even classified in the puzzle genre, at least I would say so."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@DaniboyHD A game can be possible for a kid but still have optional puzzles that challenge adults and smarter kids. Lego City Undercover was a great example of this. Kids could mess around all day and never run out of stuff to do, but those who looked deeper could also find endless challenges.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@DaniboyHD This game was lucky to receive such a high score given how expensive it is just for some toys to go with the bland Lego gameplay.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	"@DaniboyHD I don't think he said he rated it lower JUST FOR THAT REASON.

It was just one of them.  He also mention the idea of pausing your game, and reconfiguing your character on the board fell flat and really didn't offer any value to the game play but then more of an exercise task.  "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/lego-dimensions-review	@Wholedeplorable How can this game be aimed at kids when so many of the franchises involved are aimed at adults' nostalgia?  This game was marketed for everyone and so should have tougher sections for adults as well.

An online buddy of mine beat Dimensions in one sitting on launch day, and kinda found himself regretting his purchase, though he's a big LEGO fan, so it wasn't a total waste. :p

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/28/skylanders-superchargers-review	"I loved the first Skylanders, but the lack of an ""adult"" difficulty really kills these games for me.  They promised that Nightmare would make the game more interesting for older folks to where you had to level and actually play the game seriously, but it doesn't.  When I played Giants I had to reset all my figures to level 1 just for there to even be the remotest challenge on Nightmare. If they would just patch them with a better difficulty level for adults I would get this in a heartbeat, but as it is they are just too boringly easy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/28/skylanders-superchargers-review	Honestly who expects anything more than a basic story from a game like Skylanders?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	Finally IGN has started to avoid EA's rating bribing crap.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	I bought this game thinking it would be fun to play with my friends, but whenever i play with friends we get really annoyed at how the game purposely stuffs you up. I just played a game in Ultimate team and lost. BUT it was in Division 10!!! i lost 2-0. Even Using James Rodriguez! I cant tell if this game was supposed to be fun or Extremely Rage Inducing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	A FIFA review from IGN that isn't 9/10. Finally! How long did it take you guys to realise that these games are aids? Guaranteed you'll give the next game 9/10, even though these games don't deserve nowhere near that score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	@TheAtlantean It didnt get a 9/10 because it was the first fifa that didnt deserve one the other fifas were great especially because fifa is the only game based on soccer thats able to pull it off. And also dont make stuff up fifa 12-14 were the only 9+ because those were the best. Fifa 11 was 8.5 but even that one could have pulled off a 9. Fifa15 as also 8  which was the other that deserve loer than a 9.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	This game is horrible, when the computer wants your opponent to win there's no way in heaven that you're going to win, no matter how good you are. I dislike the game play very much, plus when you're playing defense for no apparent reason they call fouls that aren't fouls, this game sucks, waiting for the next one, hopefully it changes everything is soooooo frustrating!!!!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	The worst game ever ea have failed
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	"(I only play Career mode so this review will mostly be about how Career mode works and the gameplay in general)

Pros: 

Training mode 

More immersive (For example player emotion and so on)

-----------------------------------

Cons: 

Glitches happens regulary
Speed is so unbalanced (One second Ronaldo can run past everyone, the next 
Mertesacker catches up on him with no problem)

Passing is painfully bad (Players make misstakes that a 5 year old would´nt make)

First touch is awful"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	@strikerpk7 Man I soooooooooo agree with you!!!!!!! same thing online. I say sometimes not even my 6 year old would make a mistake like that. Completely sucks!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	Worst Fifa ever! Defending is disgusting. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	Fuck EA all day. I did like this game right after they patched it, now it is patched backward to play shitty again. FUCKING ASSHOLES. About until like a week ago this game was playing beautifully, now it is completely arcade fast. The game pace is being patched back and forth so it is completely out of whack, the camera swing is absolutely ridiculous now, they patched the game now so that it is just below worthwhile playing so people wouldn't play matches to farm for coins and chuck away real money for coins instead which is totally crooked and evil. Just for the fact that they are patching this piece of shit which has about a year of shelf life for each year's title so many times in a year to shift the game's pace over and over again shows how little they think and how disrespectful they really are of the gamers. I seriously am now anti EA now and I will not buy or support anything EA because they are completely souless for profits and nothing more. I seriously am at a point that I hate their guts. Burn slow EA. Burn slow.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	When I saw the score that IGN gave FIFA 16 it became clear to me how much crack IGN smokes on a regular basis.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/21/fifa-soccer-16-review	"Well, I got this ""game"" the other day. I've been a Fifa guy for a few years.  I can say with utter-surety, that this is by far the worst Fifa in some time. I usually play career, or with my friends (in the same room).  How do you ask is it worse? 
Well, for starters the 1st touch is a shambles for any player who isn't 80 or above, the passing is abysmal, the crossing ability is much worse, even if you do manage one, the keeper will come out so fast for a catch and/or clatter you.  
The offside rule's more tragic than ever (it's a simple rule).  
When on the back foot, defending is mostly pointless as the A.I will call your defenders from the back line up, rather than making your others bust a gut to track back. Shielding the ball has become a losing battle.
The refs also call foul on the most niggley little challenge, yet when you're smashed into from behind...Nope.
What happened to L1/Lb being 360 control/face goal?  Oh wait, now it's do silly little feints?!  Isn't that what the R-stick is for?!  I'm not ham fisted by any means but, the controls are far too finickity.
Plus, during set-plays, you get all these nonsense cuts for fake-sky ads or what not.
Not to mention they've not added any new injury-sub scenes., i.e; a player with a broken leg will walk off and tweak his ankle about... Really?!
Oh yes, how could I forget, why have they not added (for career ((which they took away from older versions)) a tactical scout for your next match?  How do I set up? who's in form? where are they're weaknesses? "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	"Ouch.
These comments are harsh.
Thank you very much."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	This game is awful. The physics engine on it is trash. Guys can't find the puck when it is right next to their feet. I watch AI players skate straight into the opponent and lose the puck. Defenseman go up against the board when there is not even anyone putting them against it. You can't customize your character in EASHL which is dumb. EA should sell the rights to this game cuz they can't develop it worth shit. On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this game as a piece of shit. Good job ruining a sport I enjoy EA. Your developers should go play in traffic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	"You want me to say something interesting EA? Your game is complete garbage. Everyone I know stopped playing it because you can't make a decent hockey game and your servers really sucks.

God I wish 2K was still doing it, but since you are the only one doing it now, you can do whatever the hell you want. Do you even test your crap?

Stop focusing on graphics for f*** sake."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	Saw the game on sale and I've been wanting to get NHL as I've enjoyed pasts versions including 2K's. But from what I've read pretty much everywhere this is ridiculous. I'd love to ask EA one simple, one worded question, why?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	The game is terrible. It takes no skill to play this game since the game is pretty much run by momentum.  If you have momentum you almost always win the game but if you don't you might as well get ready to start raging with all the unrealistic things that happen to make sure the other  team with momentum keeps the puck.  Straight up the worst nhl game they have made yet by far 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	I would Rather have my eyes taken out by ISIS using rusty sporks, than EVER play this game again. 15' was actually fun and took SOME skill, this season is complete nonsense. Three games in a row now, i've had 40 plus shots, to my opponents 7 and the only goal scored was by a PASS from their redline? HOW DOES THIS MAKE ANY SENSE. Not to mention, playing defense is simply IMPOSSIBLE, no more checking, and definitely attacking invisible pucks....shame on EA sports for putting this crap to market and shame on me for buying it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	@hemmers619 Sounds like you suck and are looking for someone else to blame
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	@TyCar24 @hemmers619 funny cause he speaks the truth and you just sound dumb

I am pretty sure most people here can kick you ass at this game...oh wait, the game is stupid, it will let you win."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	HOW do you give this game anything more than 5. First of all, this game relies on its online content, but sadly, NHL 16 has the worst online engine an NHL game has ever had. They won't work on the stability and lag issue, so thats already a pretty big thing. Secondly, you get the slowest paced hockey ever played on earth, and the way your players react to the controls just make it look like you have the highest ping ever (which could be the case since their servers are trash). Thats for HUT and ranked 1v1. After that you have the glitch goals, and theres a lot fo them, and by a lot i mean twice more than in any other hockey game (maybe not NHL 15 but i mean, NHL 15). The players rating are HORRIBLE, you can't give an offence machine a rating of 92+, when he's very average in defence. Offline is pretty good tho... not perfect but pretty good. so you get a good offline (sadly thats not the base of that game) and a half the online modes are absolute trash, how on earth is that anywhere near 8/10? NHL 16 (online) doesn't rewards skills as much as any other NHL game. I've frequently went 50-0 in previous NHL's, even in 15 which was the begining of the end, but 16. I've given 8 games to the online of 16 to realise how terrible it is, and how much money EA gets from those piece of shit they release. I'm done with this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	I'll never read another one of your bogus reviews. Did you even play the game or did you just cash the check? This game like your review is crap on a stick. It looks nice and has nice presentation but it's still crap!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	"This is a shameful review. The game play is pathetic. The passing feels like Im using the D-pad. EA only ever cares about presentation. ONCE AGAIN the AI reacts to everything AS SOON AS YOU PRESS A BUTTON meaning there is no 'reaction time' lag as a person might have. Online play is pathetic. Lag, controls that dont even work half the time. Wait, thats also offline, too. The controls become dyslexic at the most convenient of times. Once again, EA doesnt even care about making legit AI (or how else do you explain MY OWN PLAYERS TAKING EACH OTHER OUT AT LEAST 5 TIMES A PERIOD?!) Your poke checks never count unless theyre perfect, and then half the time theyre tripping penalties because THE GUY BLATANTLY SHOVES HIS STICK IN THE AI SKATES AND DOESNT EVEN TRY. Thats what Ive found myself saying the most about this game - They didnt even try. They just made it look and sound pretty. This isnt even lipstick on a pig, its lipstick on pig turds. They'll never make a game CLOSE to being as good as NHL 2k5, and they dont even have to try, because they own the rights. This is why monopolies are BAD.

If the store wont take the game back tomorrow, Im snapping the disc in half and throwing it in the trash. Anyone on the development team of this game should be ashamed of themselves for cashing a paycheck that resulted from this game. The day must come when EA is put out of business."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/nhl-16-review	How much did EA pay Seth to post this review? The game sucks in every facet. The worst EA sports game I have ever played.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	One of the biggest problems of the game is still present, the loot system, yes it is better than the original but you act like it is completely fixed. First place players in both the crucible and strikes can still get nothing while last place can get two legendary pieces of equipment. Also legendary gear is not dropped until level 38-40 except the one legendary you get after beating the main game. While the story is better than it first was that doesn't make it good, it's only mediocre now at best in comparison to past Bungie titles. You also have completely looked over the fact that this only expands the hive back story (barely) and deepens one of the vanguard's backgrounds (again barely) yet still hasn't addressed ANY of the other plot holes or expand any other story. Why has no reviewer said anything about the fact this is 2 years after initial release you are allowed to be overly critical of this game and you should be, over 1 billion dollars have gone into creating and fine tuning this game and yet there are still so many glaring game issues, lack luster multilayer modes, broken matchmaking for strikes, no matchmaking for raids, terrible RNG loot system, insanely large plot holes, and finally the fact that if you bought Destiny and the Taken King individually at full price you just spent $100 (in this scenario you also got the season pass) so is this really a $100 game?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	I have almost played all of the games made by Bungie. Including most of their games from their Halo series. So when Destiny came out of course I was there in line at a midnight release. I had many fun moments during the course of the game and found many of the secrets too. But then the new consoles were release and I waited to get the newest Destiny game called The taken king. At first I was concern about the 80.00 price tag, but in the end I had the full digital package. Now, here is where we begin to go downhill. All my old guns from season one were nerf which I understood, but after a while I it kept getting the same exotics which was weird. I was convinced it was my bad luck. Until, I had friends who were running into the same issues. Wait, I am sorry I am getting a head of myself. I love the story line even through the original story had parts that were cut. I still enjoyed it. But the taken king was only like 3 hours of story play. And in the end left you asking if that was all. I originally perceived that this game was supposed to be Destiny number 2 or the next in the series. Really, it’s more like a patch or a dlc something small and not really needed. That cost 40.00 dollars for regular copies and even in the end Bungie forces you to buy it. Because, all weapons were down grade from the original even if you didn’t buy The Taken King. Even in the end, Destiny is still continues to get new things added and grow. It’s almost like the game was release unfinished ………………..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	does not playing destiny affect anything in taken king
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	"Thanks, but no thanks. Got off the Destiny train a long ways back and have no intention of ever getting back on. Comparing the story in destiny to Lord of the Rings and Star Wars and then getting a game that had one of the worst story elements I have ever seen was HUGELY disappointing, especially when story is my single favorite aspect of games. I tried sticking with it, but wound up selling it a couple months later. 

Sorry Bungie, I gave Destiny a shot and it was absolutely nothing like I was expecting. Easily one of the most disappointing games I have ever played. Even if this expansion is a legitimate 9, I still won't go back. Just have no desire too, especially with so many quality games to choose from and so many new ones on the horizon. 

Again thanks, but no thanks!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	"@GotMyOrangeCrush The story line is actually very good.  The only problem is it is not granular whatsoever.  You're expected to do the research yourself, mostly by earning and reading the grimoire cards (or, just look online like I did) to piece the story, history of the different enemy factions, the three classes, the origin of the traveler, golden age, reef wars, the three races, etc.  

I don't know why, but Bungie definitely went an unorthodox route compared to ""Star Wars"" and ""Lord of the Rings"" which do a lot more story-telling hand holding and give you the basics right out the gate... which is what I prefer ... so I agree with you for the most part, Bungie could have done a lot better with the story line delivery.  But to call is disappointing is bit of a stretch.

Also, if you haven't played since the launch because you got fed up, much like I did, and returned the game to play something else, much like I did, then I strongly encourage you to pick it up after these DLCs, it is FAR better than it was in Year 1."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	@cptsta66bin @GotMyOrangeCrush I agree with you my man. I also played destiny year one and got fed up and sold it. But then i got Taken King. My weekdays are simply, 8.30-5 at work, and then 5.30 - till about 1am playing destiny. Bungie has really outdone themselves. They managed to bring a game that i believe was a 6.5 at best, to a very deserving 9. It was slightly disappointing at first, but Taken King has got me loving this game. Too bad Black Ops 3 comes out today
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	@GotMyOrangeCrush I agree with most of what you are saying regarding Destiny's story line. I have beaten all of the DLC's and the main game so I cannot be bashed for not playing the content. I did find the story lacking and I do not have the time to run around and hunt all of the grimoire cards. The most fun I had with this game was playing the raids and strikes with friends but mostly the raids. I loved taking down Crota with a good group of friends. The main story I mostly find myself slogging through just to get to the endgame content so I can play with friends. That is the heart and soul of Destiny if you do not have anyone to play with I do not recommend you play this game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	when i first play destiny i was thinking, why the hell is so many guys playing this s**t, but i realise that this could be a very good game, if they put some more to play, so if the game was released with the three expansion in day 1 it could be great, but they fail that and then decide to lauch AGAIN with a price 70 euros, ok it has the three expansion but i think they fail to deliver a better experience, or simple put this game at 30 euros or something, and this game is very similar to borderlands, but it can´t get near the borderlands just my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	I played Vanilla from launch-second until late october last year.  I was pretty bitter about how much time I spent doing boring things.  I wasn't going back.  Yesterday I got The Taken King.  It's exactly what Destiny could've/should've been.  Getting exotics is easier, yet not too easy.  You can actually do things that make sense to earn gear instead of grinding the same missions over and over.  I'm pretty happy with it so far.  Maxed out right away and beat the story in a couple hours but still have a lot to do.  I went right to the taken king storyline and skipped the other two expansions so those are next on my list. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	@PHEN0M74 I liked The Taken King but I hated how the year 1 players basically got screwed. The players who had been playing and collecting exotics and making their character a boss became noobs just like everyone else. All that time invested gone basically. Sure we know a few more things but overall I was let down by the lack of respect to the year 1 players. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	@ttagurit @PHEN0M74 Yeah, I get that side of it too.  I was super pissed when I found out that the Suros Regime and Bad JuJu I grinded for were less powerful than the basic items you get at the beginning of TTK.  But idk what else they were supposed to do, the game would've been either way too easy for experienced players or way too difficult for new players if they hadn't made those adjustments.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	@PHEN0M74 @ttagurit You do have a point but I think they could of made it a little easier I think to get those items back and up to par. I feel like I was punished in a sense with needing to grind for marks now to get a year two version. I think they should have did what they did and maybe had some special quests or achievements that you could do to power them up sooner which I feel would have been better. My major beef with destiny now is great I got these weapons I grinded for but when the next major expansion comes out they are useless again. For me to a point it defeats the purpose of the game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	This review is incredibly generous. As a former guardian who had 1,000+ hours in the game, the Taken King looks great at first glance but reveals Bungie's lack of innovation and creativity. Old weapons are removed and some reskinned year one weapons are hidden in strikes (rather than unique new guns); Crucible is still as unbalanced as ever (hello Red Death); new exotics are boring outside of a handful of unique new guns; story is still bad. Yes, it is better than year 1 story but that isn't saying much...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	@ThorinOakenshield By Red Death do you mean whoever is Red bar wins? Because Bungie has had this issue since Halo days hahaa
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	Great game. Year 2 is definitely worth it . My only gripe is no matchmaking for raids . It's just me and one other friend playing the game, and I have yet to do a raid because of this . Come on Bungie.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	@GWAG411 Bungie has encouraged people to use online matchmaking for raids such as destinytracker.com. It's not all that hard to find people to play with. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/15/destiny-the-taken-king-review	"I bought the first destiny white ps4 bundle and purchased 2 DLC along with it.. I thought this game would blow me away and in a way, it did for the first 1.5 months or so. After playing the first DLC i was so disappointed in the lack of content and the fact that all the hours spent grinding, finding items/gears meant nothing due to the new upgrade system (which made previous items/gears obsolete) drove me crazy!

By the time the 2nd DLC came out, I already lost interest so i barely played destiny which was total waste of money. Overall, I strongly felt that all the DLC up to this point should've came with the first game. Then i could agree that it was worth the money/time spent. Instead the developers decided to tax the crap out of the gamers... smh

It's been lil less than a yr since i stopped playing destiny due to the mind numbing grind sessions and repetitive nature of the game.. and without a group of 5 or more friends to play with, it's really pointless. As the reviewer mentioned, matchmaking in all game modes (raids, daily missions, etc) would probably be the only way i would get back in the game (since all my friends stopped playing and were adamant on ever playing destiny again bc they felt ""robbed"").

SO bungie/activision, with all the money you've taxed us, can't you get matchmaking system setup?? c'mon man!"

AI is much better, the graphics are surprisingly good (the screen shots defo don't do it any justice!), controls have improved to include more complicated tackling skills & Career mode is just awesome!! The next step will be to incorporate a storyline/post match conference scenario similar to NBA2K into the Career mode! But until then I am very happy with this purchase & will definitely be playing this for a very long time! I'd give it a 7.8-8!!

But If you are playing EA FIFA 16, you are attacking all the time and all the matches are about your team vs opponent's super goalkeeper ... There is nothing in between game-play interesting. Bad passes, robotic shoots, pushing technique is poor, players on ball poor, tackling and defending is worst even if you are using legacy defending: player are not going on ball but going to dodge himself, keeper are flying and stopping shots even you kicked from penalty box .. FIFA is the most pathetic version in football gaming."

You should be subtracting from the score for that shite. They even advertise it on the steam store with the PS4's screenshots and videos to hide it.

PES vs FIFA.Great to have two football franchises rather than just one."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	@Bloodmando FIFA is actually developed in Canada.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	FIFA is like a joke against PES, FIFA just eaten up every single license available and does not let any body else touch them, so many people that playing football just for licenses, thinking oh my god FIFA is very good that every single team has real kit, oh my GOD! although the game play is crappy childish and ridiculous in FIFA, Players are like robots when missing a chance, or when scoring, The entrance scene is more ridiculous when players lagging when walking. and their shorts moving in a recursive and repetitive mode. Players movements in game play is horrible, they are like wood sticks that has no bending. FIFA is for any one who plays football just for real kits and seeks to score some magical goals that never happens in real life. if EA lets others use some licenses there will be no customer for FIFA any more. and EA knows it, so does anything to eat every single license exclusively. EA loves MONEY more than anything else. because FIFA can't catch up PES in game play, they spend more money to STOP PES, instead of doing some work to get themselves better, its very sad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	The reviews for this game both from critics and gamers all suggest roughly the same, maybe not a 9.5 but certainly better than fifa, look online and you'll see on average this has scored better. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	@Rom30 Exactly what I am thinking .... User reviews for this game = 8.2 / 5.1 for Fifa 16.  And 5.1 is way to generous for that piece of garbage.  The question now is should I buy this - or just play Fifa 15?  The reason I am considering buying this is cause the Fifa 15 I have is on x-box360 - last gen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	"Bought Fifa 16 and PES16, have been playing Fifa since Fifa 2001 right through every year. Fifa 15 started to get annoyingly unrealistic. Fifa 16 barely played 10 games, it's the same story different cover. There's just something different to PES, I enjoy every moment, as for Fifa I don't even enjoy a moment. I wouldnt say either is a bad game, but I do believe the ratings are accurate and PES is definitely the more realistic. PES 16 biggest critic from my side would still be the keepers and thats all, Fifa wins the ""keeper battle""  by miles, but other than that PES 16 hands down. I literally have already sold my Fifa to get back as much money as I possibly can, because it was just laying there. Added all the kits to the leagues everything is official and decent and to have official Uefa Champs League is a better feel than having to play for the champions cup. Great job PES and FIFA, and IGN. Ratings are spot on."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	"This game is the first in history to ever make me appreciate an EA production.  I bought this game over Fifa based purely on the rating as I used to have a high respect for the reviewers on this site.  But as you can tell, I think this game is truly terrible.  

Firstly, the Goalkeepers may as well not exist, swap them out for an extra defender if you can because they can't save anything.  Secondly the crowd atmosphere gives the impression you're playing an U12 match in Greenland.  The players also feel a bit slow and unresponsive.  Goals are so easy to score they no longer feel like any sort of achievement.  And it feels completely unplayable, I love football games but I was bored out of my mind after 3 games in Career mode.

As a result this game doesn't hold a candle to the last football game I played (Fifa 14), unless Fifa 16 removed all of their features I strongly suggest you buy that instead.  Everything Fifa does this game either does slightly worse or dramatically worse.  I can't even imagine the huge bribe ign took to give this a 9.5."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	"@ae531441 Glad someone talks sense! Everything the reviewer praises about PES here, I think Fifa 16 does better. Plus you have things like the realistic player animations in Fifa, the players in PES look too robotic. Shooting is weird in PES too, everything just 'pings' off the players foot, you don't get a perfect connection with the ball everytime!
As someone who plays football twice a week I find Fifa 16 much more realistic and satisfying. Tactics and formation changes in Fifa 16 give you much more control than in PES (more than ever this year)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	@ae531441 Fifa 13, 14, and 15 were great.  Fifa 16 is a MASSIVE step backwards.  And while they didnt remove all their features, they did remove a lot of them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2016-review	"This review is misguided and clearly written by someone who has an arcade-based knowledge of football.
The game mechanics are archaic. You can beat the com 9-0 on the top level within a couple of weeks of playing it casually. The graphics don't render correctly online. The music is terrible. The commentary lacks authenticity. The interface is antiquated. I could go on...
This review claims that the game is the most realistic representation of football when in fact it's quite the opposite.
FIFA hasn't been as close to perfection as it has been in recent years but its basic mechanics and realism make it a champions league side compared to this arcade-like league 2 waste of £30."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	I so regret buying the second game. This series is awful.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	I just couldnt ever find the allure of One Piece or Naruto. Not that they are bad by any means.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	"I can't speak for Naruto, but the reason I first started watching One Piece was because it was... fun. The story made no sense, the characters were stupid and over the top, and the fight scenes were often very underwhelming for all the hype - but it was fun. For the first hundred episodes or so, I often genuinely laughed at the stupid shit on screen, and the on-and-off great voice acting and writing. There was something very simple and enjoyable about the series.
Now, unfortunately, that has kind of diminished by now. Now, the show takes the story very seriously, it tries to tug at your heart string every few episodes with catastrophe after catastrophe, and everything has to raise the bar. Even with the filler, there's rarely an episode that's just fun any more - there has to be so much drama. Which isn't to say the early episodes weren't like this, but they were still funny. I stopped watching One Piece when it stopped trying to make me laugh.
I don't think One Piece transitions well to video game, since the focus on humour and really drawn out drama falls kind of flat with a controller. One Piece always hypes everything up, and there's no way a player will be able to satisfy that hype - in my experience."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	I hear you. Its madness was one of the things that did bring it to my attention. I may someday go back to watch it in earnest just to see if I can get into it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	I'll totally watch this show again once it's finished.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	@SithRuleTwo A few of the Naruto games have actually been pretty good last gen.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	"the PC version is ubber crap. 5/10. ""no online for you PC peasants"", ps3 graphics(middle finger up), no vsync, no controller layout, no rumble on controller. the only thing that devs said about the problems+graphics was ""we know the issue and we investigate"". after that, more than 10 days have passed and not a single word. they haven't replied to anybody in any of their social media. is this how you treat us PC players?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/11/one-piece-pirate-warriors-3-review	"I wouldn't expect graphics to ever be good in these types of games, 100 enemies on screen is hard on any system even the ""almighty"" PC... So no matter how many of these games they make they will always be low Poly and dumb AI...
The other issues have reason to be hated."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/10/dragon-age-inquisition-trespasser-review	"This is a frustrating review, because Sullivan, the reviewer, obviously wasn't super-familiar with DAI and didn't seem to have either finished DAI or done so with much attention to detail. It's the only way I can understand someone saying that the only satisfying decisions were those involving the aristocrats at the summit... I mean... GAH. I literally sat here wondering if she had played the same game I had.

Because the outcomes in ""Trespasser"" -- especially those involving Bull and Solas -- are dramatic, absolutely 100% in-character and tied to the major decisions you made in the main game. Trespasser's potential for devastating outcomes for two very popular characters should silence anyone who said our decisions in the main game didn't matter -- boy, did they, and the results can be seriously tragic (and yet also absolutely believable).

As far as loot, again, I don't know where the reviewer is coming form -- as other posters have noted, you get the superb ""Skin That Stalks/Hand That Cuts/Eye That Weeps, etc."" armor/equipment series if you take part in four optional tough demon miniboss battles, and the staff you pick up from beating the boss on the bridge in the mines (the Staff of Rage) is FANTASTIC. Enemies kind of just melt away, it's amazing. Best of all, if you use the Golden Nug to sync up during the game, whenever you replay DAI again in the future, most of those recipes will be available to you right at the beginning of the next playthrough.

But my biggest nitpick is that the reviewer also didn't seem to have paid attention in DAI at all -- she misspells Fen'Harel, then (worse) doesn't seem to realize WHO THAT IS despite the reveal at the end of DAI (which I have a feeling she missed), or the significance of the character, or WHY we're learning all the lore we uncover in ""Trespasser.""

Anyway, I'd give this review a 7 -- and Trespasser a 9. Ultimately, I loved the DLC and thought it was a love letter to fans. It provided a satisfying and powerful closure to the game before what I hope will be a new chapter in DA4. And don't miss sitting through the end credits, they'll give you a laugh when you really need one (depending on who did or didn't survive for you)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/10/dragon-age-inquisition-trespasser-review	GREAT DLC WITH A GOOD STORY BUT MAKE SURE THAT YOU ARE FINISHED WITH EVERYTHING ELSE OR SAVE BEFORE STARTING BECAUSE YOU CANT GO BACK.... KIND OF SCREWED MYSELF OVER ON THAT ONE
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/10/dragon-age-inquisition-trespasser-review	This DLC is Mass Effect 3 ending but you just need to pay extra to get it. Not only that all decisions you made ind DAI doesn't matter, but even what you do in Trespasser doesn't matter. It all boils down to last dialog in the game where you press option A or B. I can't believe this guys have no idea how to use resources of their own game. Throauth Inquisition you are gathering resources that are called Influence and power. How on earth did nobody in Bioware see the hint that they can actually INFLUENCE stuff? All that drama about Mass Effect 3 ending fell on deaf ears. I love Bioware and I will buy every game they make but I'm beginning to think that there is actually no hope for them to understand that gameplay can influence ending.

I want shit flying apart.. pieces everywhere.. I don't want to watch damage graphics from grand turismo from the playstation.. LAME... seems like the new generation of games follows the new generation of young people.. LAZY... ... I mean are you kidding me!??? I had very high expectations for this game, wow what a wash out.. I want my 44$ back. I hope the game designer reads this and realizes that he or she has no sense of pride and only sees dollar signs.. easily this game shoulda been rated a 5 or a 6.. and that's being generous.. reminds me of playing battlefield 4.. they put flash lights on sniper rifles.. well they may as well have... im referring to the reflection off the snipers scope lens.. well ladies and gentleman... im sorry to break it to you.. a sniper has an extreme advantage over EVERYONE.. a snipers scope has no reflection.. do you know why.. its called a sun shade! ... if people STILL don't understand.. or think its ''unfair'' google search.. ''sniper'' and what they do.. please do before you go online and start whining and crying about being sniped.. if u got sniped.. you had it coming.. PERIOD. its all about concealment and camouflage. anyways.. sorry that was off topic.. yeah forza 6 sucks.. really bummed out.. actually almost all new video games suck,  well gta 5 is good.. so far.. shows more damage on cars than this ''game''...amazing that the world now days has NO pride in their work.. wow... im an automotive technician in real life.. have been for over 8 years.. you don't see me leaving nuts and bolts loose.. you know why? .. because I give a shit ... and have PRIDE...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/08/forza-motorsport-6-review	"I had high expectations for this game which is why i must talk about the disappointing parts of it... because there are too many for this to be a 9/10 game. Dont get me wrong, I want this to be the perfect game but it didn't satisfy me to say the least.

1) Player Incentive: 2/10
Lets start with the worst: Way too many Money and Car Spins!
So this is supposed to be a game and I understand it should be fun for everyone... but making it so easy to jump into a Ferrari or max out your M4 within 2 hours of playing the game, really kills the thrill of slowly moving up the performance chain. I'm sure many can relate to the days where making enough money to add a new exhaust to your car and make it a little faster were epic moments. Now well... you just spin the wheel after your first win, get a million credits and crash your ferrari. The reward factor is therefore 2/10. 
I would limit the spins to 10 times less then they are now. I mean seriously I have many insane cars and 5 million credits and I havn't even played 25% of the game. Add that to the fact that I just max out a car as soon as I buy it... just kills the fun really and as a businessman, this is not getting you customers for Forza 7 I can assure you. You must create the addiction and reward is number one factor in gaming imo.

2) LapTimes: 6/10"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	So I've just been playing this game... And I've come to a conclusion... My conclusion is that anyone that doesn't think this game is great must be missing half a brain..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	Nostalgia is what makes people say that about Half Life 2 as well in my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	@DevilsClaw1991 Played HL2 recently, and actually, recommenced it to a new Steam gamer, last night. It's a good game, and fun to play. It's also $1 on Steam right now...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	Resident Evil Revelations says no.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	So one game that does work means every other one will as well?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	No, it means I have different tastes than you. I can appreciate MGS for being very good mechanically, I am just not into the stealth/sneak games and while I understand there are other ways to play, the emphasis is still on sneaking. I am fine with games that incorporate stealth just not games centered around it. If you learn one thing today, let it be that you should never insult another person's opinions. As crazy as they may sound to you, they have their reasoning and have a right to their opinions.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	Then that just means you have terrible taste in games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	I guess all the other good reviews don't count since IGN has told us what to think about this game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	Media Molecule absolutely needs to go back to LBP, so that franchise can be redeemed with what little glory it has left. I can't believe Sony let anyone else get near that IP after how disastrous LBP Karting was, which they refused to proper support post launch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	This isn't what the PS4 needs. If there's something to learn from Nintendo, it's that creating similar game libraries on two different systems that are both currently supported is counter productive. What's even worse is that this just seems like a downgraded experience than what the original Vita game offers, regardless of extra content.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	"funny how little big planet did so well on the ps3
tearaway is not a console type of game.
It never belonged on the ps4
Media Molecule should come up with a new IP with more replay value or go to back to LBP"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	I like this game. Not mind-blowing, but slightly above average. You put in your 8-12 hours, you have fun, you put it on the shelf, and maybe play it again in a few years. It's one of those games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/tearaway-unfolded-review	I would consider buying it used. I bought a one with a 4 gb card for 140 and a few games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/super-mario-maker-review	Definitely one of the top 10 games on Wii U. A must-have!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/super-mario-maker-review	Re-review and give it  a 10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/super-mario-maker-review	I love this game. I hope that it gets a sequel. I'd love to see more SMB 2 Mechanics thrown into the mix in addition to slanted platforms, user created world maps, more level themes/backgrounds, power-ups (colored yoshi's, hammer suits, and individualized powers for amiibo characters would be incredible) , more enemies and I'd really like to be able to wall jump/butt-stomp on the NES/SNES game interfaces...Oh, yeah...and Koopa kids.  I know that it's asking a lot but if anyone can do it Nintendo could.

Cheeck points are now available."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/super-mario-maker-review	You owe this game justice; you need to update its rating
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/02/super-mario-maker-review	Ironically the two things you took points off on this review have been added into the game in recent updates

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	"This game is flippin' fantastic. I feel like an idiot for just now playing it (as a Mad Max fan). It's not a perfect game buts It's just a freakin' perfect Mad Max game. The look, tone, and writing is just spot on. If you're a Mad Max fan at all you really should already be playing this game. 

The only thing I would really change is more interaction and gameplay with the dog companion. I wish he was just always with you."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	" This is a perfect example of a ""meh"" game that will inspire a lot of love and a lot of hate, and I think both are valid.  It looks really nice, the car combat is fun and I'm a sucker for a visual upgrading system like the Magnum Opus, the voice acting is good and the story is decent for a Mad Max story (although whatever Paul Greengrass wannabe handled the shaky cam should be fired, especially after the beautifully center framed and steady Fury Road). But even buying it today (on PS4), there are a ton of technical issues, portions of the UI just don't like to load all the time, I encountered several invisible walls just out in the wasteland and the audio, specifically the engine noise, shifted from annoyingly loud to almost non-existent seemingly at random.  Add in some wonky enemy AI at times, a complete lack of enemy variety aside from visual (the first boss you face = functionally identical to every other boss you face), rather repetitive quests and grindy scrap gathering and a completely lack luster end game and imo you end up with at best a very average game.  Do I regret buying it?  Not at $8, but if i bought it at launch instead of MGSV like I originally intended, I would've been sorely disappointed"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	"Been wanting to pick this one up for a long time now. Decided to play it yesterday, and I must say it's the hidden gem I've expected and felt it to be.
This review is spot on; the game perfectly captures the cold and cynical approach of the movies and the approach to storytelling is wonderfully minimalistic. Lots of stuff to do, but not too much for my taste - scavenging spots can be quickly explored and the game tells you when there's nothing more to do here, which I personally welcome since I'm actually not too much fo an open-world fan, when you feel there's infinitely exploring ahead. This game kind of limits the sandbox in the right areas for me.
Combat is bloody and brutally satisfying, and the V8 car enthusiasm should be joy in the heart of every Mad Max fan.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	@danksch Completely agreed. I just picked this up this last weekend and felt like a fool for only just now playing it. Really is a hidden gem that deserves more attention than it received. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	Such an underrated game, I really hope it makes enough for a sequel
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	Ya if u have the game pass make sure you give this gem a go
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	Great review, could not have said it much better myself
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	@Game_Review_Journal I just want to know if you can turn off the button prompts for counters. That's my only gripe with how this game looks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	"upgrades and unlocks  - boring!

Just give me an epic cinematic adventure like the Uncharted series but without the chaff./"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	I hear Ya there
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	"I reckon that Hardy should've voiced Max - would've been pretty cool. Gibson isn't really suitable for his age, but Hardy is the best choice in my opinion.

I haven't even bought the game yet, so I'm really looking forward to experiencing this !!!!!
Who else thinks that Naughty Dog should've helped producing this game ??? I'm the only one...okeeh

Just a tip for those gamers who plays this (as I will be in the near future), whenever there's a car chase, listen to Brothers in Arms (in the Mad Max Fury Road OST). It'd be pretty cool though"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	@LKMRockatansky04 The voice actor in the game is actually really great/perfect. Would highly recommend picking it up. I wouldn't even say I wished Naughty Dog would have made it because what he got was a perfect Max Max game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	Much better than I ever would have imagined. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/31/mad-max-review	I just wanna say, Cathartic combat is a farce and a lie. regular combat is a bit eh, you do a quick time event and finish an enemy, and as soon as the cut scene is done, another enemy attacks and does damage before you react... now the boss battles are broken, badly. I'll Melee and what not, and sometimes, just before they attack, they don't take damage. and the boss battle at Gasworks. the boss had no health, but still ram-charged up to me and insta-killed...I was set back to the beginning of the fight and had to hear that cod pieces cut scene again before I could skip.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	This is only 10 bucks on xbox live.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	Get rid of the split-screen everyone one has big screens they can handle 2 players on one screen this isn't the 90's anymore.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	@BatwomanLover I disagree.  The split-screen is good for showing each player's perspective - something necessary in a game like this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	As an owner of all 3, this one is FAR BETTER. I didn't like 1 or 2 at all, and I'm very much enjoying 3.0. I am playing the Steam version (more affordable)!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	You're talking way too much sense for this crowd. Way too my much sense...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	This. Although that IS some expensive DLC...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	How is 4player in this game, co-op, versus, offline or online?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	I would be losing my shit if I was still a kid and this game existed..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	Agreed, not only is split screen a problem in itself but it seems the game loses many frames and the frame rate is considerably lower. They need to an onscreen system like the older lego games or at least do something like modern lego games where it is entirely up to you whether you go into split screen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	The digital version is for PC, iPhone, Android etc and is only Toy Box 2.0, so there is no playset (campaign). To play the actual game you need the portal, playset and at least 1 figure.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/disney-infinity-30-review	"It looks a lot like the lighter side of the Clone Wars cartoon. Gameplay wise it is much like any sandbox game, you have main missions and lots of side quests (usually things like fetch quests or defeat X number of enemies). You fly to other planets (with some space combat thrown in) and get a bunch more quests. Combat is surprisingly good, with upgradable combos . It is simple to play but it recreates a nice Star Wars universe. The Toybox lets you download levels built by other people or build your own, so there's a lot of potential there.
It's definitely designed for children but it's a quality product. Even though it hasn't challenged me at all I've had a lot of fun exploring the worlds."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	This game makes me think of a shooter version of Bayonetta or Devil May Cry. A big thumbs up to Vahlhalla Game Studios for making a fun game and for continuing to support the game through free additional content each month! On Amazon the game has 4.5/5 stars!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	 its a breath of fresh air best shooter ever why is it that reviewers are rating this game bad when gamers are rating it and they say its really good why is it that while IGN rates it as 3.5  gamers rate it as 7.1 and on game spot also GS gave it a 3 but gamers rate it as 9.5 on gS site same goes for metacritic D3 is getting better reviews on Metacritic by users than COD BOPS III
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@DaCrow What I have noticed is most reviews don't talk about the online multiplayer. How do you review half of the game?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	Nintendo is on quite the run with all of the recent quality releases for the Wii U. Since the start of 2015, you can count them on one hand. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@mike929 Depends what you mean by quality and what you mean by Nintendo, because Devil's Third is a third party game published by Nintendo. But as far as quality, 2015 had Xenoblade Chronicles X, Splatoon, Yoshi's Woolly World, Kirby & the Rainbow Curse, Fatal Frame: Maiden of Black Water, and Super Mario Maker. That's more than one hand. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@BERT0503 @mike929 Not for him it isn't. He sounds inbred, so I wouldn't be surprised if he had a couple of extra fingers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	"I bought Devil's Third with low expectations, but even though I already knew that there's something wrong with mainstream reviews I'm still hoping to be surprised. And boy the reviews were not accurate. One note is no one should play this game in ""EASY"" mode and call it a soulless piece of garbage. It's more inclined with the Ninja Gaiden series in difficulty. There are bosses (except Molotov) that can kill you instantly in one or two hits and that's playing in ""STANDARD MODE"". This game will definitely test your skill and patience.

The plot is like a B-movie action flick with the typical Eastern European over-the-top protagonist (Ivan) but it's very self-aware. It's like a parody of all action flicks you've ever watched. The hybrid mechanic of third person hack n' slash and first person shooter works just fine, you just need to know when to use it.

Note: If you're on ""EASY"" mode you can button-mash and shoot away all you like even on boss fights. It's not supposes to be played that way there are certain timing on every move/attack. Playing this game on ""STANDARD"" and ""HARDCORE"" mode is the best way in my opinion.

Like Itakagi San said, this game is not for the unskilled gamers. Its mechanics is very old-school, no healing item (auto-healing ala CoD), no extra life, skill-based in-your-face hardcore game. It's definitely a winner to me and I know there are gamers out there who likes punishing games. Graphics is not top notch but still good. I've read and watched a lot of complains about glitches which to me is very minor and I think comparing it to PS2 graphics is just plain mean. Nonetheless it's a fun romp and a very hard one. You should give it a try."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@lord_gyron I've been hooked on the online multiplayer since day-one. And I've seen a lot of level 80 players so it's no just me. I also like that you can create your own username that is different from your Nintendo ID.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@lord_gyron Vince Ingenito has the habit of calling a game on easy mode to be easy and a game without difficult settings to be difficult. Why is he still on the game review industry is truly a conundrum to me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	"Ok, Im confused

This game came out very recently, but it was reviewed months ago because it  apparently came out on  PC but they always listed it as a Wii U game.

But now that its  released its been  getting somewhat  better reviews,  but its clumped in with the original terrible ones.

Is this game worth buying or what?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@Shizno759 What happened is that it came out on Wii U in Japan and Europe early in the year, but it just came out on Wii U in North America in December. The PC version will only have the online multiplayer. It's worth buying if you just want to play a fun game, willing to go in without high expectations. I feel like the online multiplayer is like the one in The Last of Us. Expectations were too high, that's why critics were so rough on a game that looks like last gen, but a fun game no doubt.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	valhallagamestudios need to be shot.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@LinksDad You must not have played the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@BERT0503 @LinksDad True i haven't .... :D ...... but all the critics cursed it, so do few reviews on youtube.... funny thing is i have a sealed copy because i thought it might be a cult classic and worth some value later. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	@LinksDad @BERT0503 Like you said...few reviews on youtube. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	I knew this game wasn't going to be good when I saw footage of it at E3 2014. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	Let me start by saying Devil's Third has some addictive online multiplayer. Yes, the game looks like a last gen game. Yes, it's cheesy and fun violence. And yes it's not perfect. I enjoyed the single player campaign (expectations were not high) and let me start by saying that what Devil's Third does, it does well. It's not perfect and not a big AAA game like Call of Duty. But the online multiplayer is where the game shines so it is too unfortunate that the online multiplayer is what barely any reviews talk about. If this game looked like a current gen game, it would have won critics over. When you play the online multiplayer, there is nothing like shooting at someone up close and then beating them up (with swords, kicks, or punches) a second later. The whole shooter/melee mix works well and the maps allow for a lot to go on in the 16 player multiplayer. The online multiplayer is just as addictive as Call of Duty but it reminds me a lot of the online multiplayer in The Last of Us. The game is more like an 8/10 and I challenge Wii U owners to give it a try. I pre-ordered my copy from Best Buy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/28/devils-third-review	I am guess the games director former employer might have had something to do with the insanely bad review
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	If I have to be completely honest I played this first instead of the original Dishonored on PS3 and Xbox. I prefer this and that's mostly because of the improved graphics and stuff you get, I personally give this game 9.5 Outsiders marks out of 10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	@memes420 Thought this was the first with all DLC 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	What's the size of the Definitive Edition for PC?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	So how to play without ruining the progress? Just take 3 bone charms( whatever the ya re)?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	You mean they didn't even add a new game plus mode? OP character or not, it would've been nice to have.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	"HAHA I know right! I was thinking in my head ""I'm older and wiser, this should be easy."" Nope, not able to beat it like I did."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	The game looks slightly better than the PC version by everything that i've seen, but the frame rate thing is inexcusable. Regardless, as someone who missed it last gen, i love this Definitive Edition. I think it looks great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	I've never gotten into stealth games, but i really took to Dishonored. The look of the game, the design of the city, the special powers, the brilliant level design, the cool story, the fantastic voice acting-- all of it opened up the stealth gameplay so that i really got into it. I thought it was truly great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	Like the world needs another open world game. This game has levels. Brilliantly designed levels. And i would have it no other way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/27/dishonored-definitive-edition-review	"Looks like a Half-life 2 clone to me, i'm gonna play the hell out of this.
First of all, you say that like the world is flooded with HL2 clones. Secondly, you say it like it's a bad thing. And finally, it's not at all a clone, but it does share some of it's visual design with HL2, especially City 17, and that's what drew me to the game in the first place. But otherwise, it's nothing like HL2.
You should give it a shot-- it's a hell of a lot of fun to play."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	I want a Megaman Collection for the battle network games, I'm tired of seeing collections of the same megaman games over and over, they've done the original megaman games as a collection like 3 or 4 times now.  How about including some of the other games too?  There's more to megaman than just Megaman 1-8 and Megaman X, there's the battle network series, the Megaman Zero series, Megaman ZX and ZX advent, Megaman X command Mission, etc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	We've got to stop talking about Inafune like he is the Kojima of the Mega Man series... He was no more than a second fiddle among the team that produced the classic mega man games. For these six originals, he did some nice art design but that was basically it. There is a reason the mighty nine failed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	Is this better on 3DS, PC or Console?!? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	"I hope that Jared didn't take off review points because it doesn't have a ""rewind"" feature like Rare Replay. Because in all actuality it sort of does. On my 3DS version if you hit the right bumper it brings up an options screen. On that screen you can create a save state anywhere you are in the game. You can also load that save state anytime you wish taking you back to where you saved. So if you are doing great and save the game only to get wrecked shortly after all you have to do is hit load and boom, you're right back where you were sitting pretty again before your snafu. Yeah it can break the game if you're saving/loading every 5 seconds, but for some people it may be the only way to make it through the game their first time playing. Had I not done this in Mega Man 3 while having to fight all the MM2 bosses I would have been destroyed. Good thing for second, third, and even 23rd chances to fight the same boss!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	Currently for sale on PSN.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	Is it possible to get a Battle Network Legacy Collection too? Because those games ROCKED.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	@Sean.H They totally did Rock Man.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	This should have had 7-10 since its the Legacy collection. Hopefully a Mega Man X Legacy Collection will follow. Too bad bitch ass Konami never gave the world a Contra Collection...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	One of my memories of mega man the dispersing platforms man that was frustrating especially when you get to the parts where there are spikes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/25/mega-man-legacy-collection-review	This should be on vita now
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	Gleefully cheesy? Only a bitch would even think something that stupid. This is gaming for girls... I guess or bitches more like. This is the most unlikable bunch of asshokes ever to invade video games since mass effect Andromeda
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	" Game is pretty and entertaining. I initially thought is was going to be something like Cabin in the Woods with loads of different monsters/horrors lurking around.  I even played the first part of the game under that premise and it made the game creepier. I was disappointed when I found out whats what.  I would like the sequel to follow the Cabin in the Woods format. 
 
Its still pretty fun experience. I wouldn't classify it an survival horror though. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	Just finished the game and while I enjoyed it, there was one thing that really bothered me. The developers obviously don't understand how cold Alberta's winters are. The characters are running around lightly dressed and at points they jump into water. The monster wasn't gonna be the one that killed them, it was gonna be hypothermia.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	I love this game, I'm super hooked. The second part is genius, it's the plot twists that propel this to a solid 8.0 --granted it's more of an interactive movie than a game but I like it

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	One of the best games I have played...rubbish review!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	Your a fucking idiot then and have no taste
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	I picked this up for $15 on Black Friday.  Wasn't expecting it to be as good as it is.  I started playing it on a weekend afternoon, and I didn't stop until I was finished.  The graphics are amazing, as well as the acting.  The story gets weird at a certain point, but it's still good.  I'm also thinking of firing up a 2nd playthrough just to see how much my decisions will affect the outcome of the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	"Bought this game several months ago out of the blue.  Was in gamestop looking for games and saw this.  Read the back and scooped it up with hopes it was good.  I was not disappointed.

First off, I don't know why, but the IGN review writer is not accurate.  Hayden's characters does NOT spend half the game in a towel.  Out of a five hour game, she spends between half an hour and an hour.  Couples do not try to have sex at the wrong times, One couple in a secluded cabin are given the option to get cozy, however, other than coats coming off, they are both completely clothed.  So not sure what she saw as couples going to dangerous lengths to have sex.

I recommend this game, 8/10.

My only concern was with the character movement.  However, as with Silent Hill and Resident Evil, the first time I played both those games I had the same problem.  The controls were different, and therefore a bit awkward for me.  But after about half an hour of play, the controls become familiar and are no longer an issue."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/until-dawn-review	Bad review. Just like the Outlast/Whistleblower reviews by Marty. Score isn't the problem, it's the writing that is completely asinine.

MUT is the dumbest money-grab I have ever seen. There is nothing that can be done with that team unless you pay a retarded amount of money.
The Franchise mode is (as I've heard a lot in this forum) WAY too stripped down and mind numbingly frustrating. No sub packages????? No in huddle spell subs???? And why in the HELL would they not allow you to customize your audibles????????
EA: please pay attention!!!!!! You may have just lost a life long supporter. This was the biggest waste of $60 I have ever made.
And don't even let me get into the glitches. The controls are SO unresponsive and buggy that I'm about to delete the game off of my xbox one.
OH!!! And to IGN's Mike Mitchel, how much is EA paying you for that review???? You have lost ALL credibility with me."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/madden-nfl-16-review	Madden overrates the receivers and underrated the dbs 8-10 times the recover beats the corner on a jump ball. Jump balls are not that easy that should serenity be fixed on madden 17 give the dbs better coverage every play somebody is wide open especially on corner routes

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/madden-nfl-16-review	"""Connected Franchise mode returns almost exactly the same.""  - And here is why this game fails miserably despite what you call major improvements this year.  EA has dropped the ball on the most important part of the game because they make money off of ""Ultimate Team"" games.  ITs not just Madden, its Fifa, UFC, and every EA sports franchise game.  Stuff that existed back in 2012 no longer exists, is broken (like game freezes / cant advance beyond a certain point broken), or has been dumbed down.  I see someone below mentioned MLB The Show - exactly right, that is how a sports game should cater to players in career modes.  EA is just milking people dry and not even releasing playable games anymore (not playable career/franchise modes at least)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/madden-nfl-16-review	I'm kinda done with EA nowadays. The only sports games I play are MLB The Show and then I'll play some WWE 2k16 with friends.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/madden-nfl-16-review	Yo, what's your gamertag? I can't seem to find anyone online on WWE for Xbox one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/madden-nfl-16-review	"Welp.  This was my last Madden I buy for at least a few years.  Once again I am overwhelmed with disappointment.  Maybe I'm just spoiled being a huge ""MLB The Show"" fan, but things that feel like they should be standard are still missing from this game.

Can't enter the draft on career mode... you're forced to pick a team.  The entire mode is so basic its ridiculous.  

Still can't create team logos/jerseys/names for MUT.  I am not a fan of the game mode, but I play the version of it they have on The Show and enjoy it because of the customization.  I would gladly try to get into it on Madden if my team had its own identity.  

Still can't do autosubs for specific formations.  

I should have known better.  I figured career mode had to of improved at least a little from last year's Madden.  I give up on this franchise for now.  The gameplay is fine, I've never had a problem with it.  The lack of ""character"" in the modes is what kills me.  Everything feels so stripped down...hard to believe this is ""next gen"" Madden.  There's zero imagination or creativity put into any of this.  C'mon EA?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/24/madden-nfl-16-review	Did offline career mode/franchise mode improve finally?  I hate Ultimate Team, don't play it.  Online games are fun, but I don't spend a ton of time on them.  Only really interested in career mode.  Been disappointed with it ever since you couldn't enter the draft and get selected by a random team.  Also miss being able to copy my face on my player like you could a few years ago.  Either of those back in the game?  Any new twists to it that give it more of an RPG feel besides just playing your games and allotting stats?

I wish there was a option to buy basic consoles with out online everything. I remember buy a game and coming home . Popping it in and not having to wait hours to play it . Thoughs were good times.

I was purchasing an XBOXONE-S 2 TB system which WILL NOT play gears of war 4 in 4k as the game was made but will play 4k movies/stream. This is very misleading Microsoft! One girl wanted to argue with me at a game store because she was not informed at gamestop. I called like 10-15 places on release day for one-s and maybe half was aware xboxone-s will NOT play 4k games even though gears 4 will be released in 4k with an upscale package including the one-s. Very misleading and disappointing.
How much since does this make?
I have like the best of the best right?
4k TV
4K Xboxone-s
4k gears of war 4 game
O yeah the 4k xboxone-s will not play games in 4k only movies.
I still want a full refund for battlefield hardline microsoft!!! 720p is what I got?? For a next gen console why let this crap be put out when my old projection screen TVs would at least get 1080i like almost 20 years ago then a few years later everything was 1080p
I have always backed xbox and gears too but Sony steps up and microsoft keeps getting lowdown then im out for good and never owned a playstation period. I have had every xbox system and the gears saga but im pissed at a few things as of late and i have decided the only way to get some things changed is if i let out a roar so rrrroooooaaaaarrrr!!!!!"

This is a solid 7.5. Man its too stiff, the controls feel terrible, and the MAPS have been altered too much. No more frag tagging? Man that ws half the fun.. and don't say it needed to be changed, there is a reason still play it 10 years later. Graphics are pretty sick but really the game has been altered too much. OMG i hope the next gen gears isn't like this or judgement.
The timing on the chainsaw is gone and renders that part of the machine gun virtually useless now. The walls are so sticky that its frustrating and ruins the speed of the game. Characters feel too clunky.. I do like the weight of the characters now in terms of the footsteps making a solid sound like they weigh 250 pounds..

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	Hideo Kojima, if you read this, you need to reboot the Zone of the Enders series... imagine how amazing you'd make it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	"This was the first Metal Gear Solid game I ever played, so I cannot compare it with previous titles. MGSV is one of the most amazing games I ever played, period. The open world is beautiful and athmospheric, the gameplay is perfect, the graphic are amazing, the story is surprising and captivating, and the soundtrack is awesome. The quantity of vehicles, weapons, tactics and customization is just staggering (you can build a zoo in the motherbase, and that says it all).
People have different approaches towards what a videogame should be. To me, perfect gameplay only becomes relevant when in the context of a story that I identify with, that I personally want to experience, and this is such a case. The plot kept me constantly surprised (the end is mind-blowing) and has a lot of creative and deep concepts such as the importance of language as a weapon or the relations between humanity and parasitic organisms. It also has a lot of emotional content, if one is not interested simply in killing stuff and getting loot. For me, videogames are a tremendous medium of communication, and this is an amazing example of gameplay, emotion and narrative. Quiet is an amazing character (definitely second only to Big Boss himself in the game) and her story and relation to the protagonist are also amazing, independently of the cristicism that her outfit and depiction received (some of it deserved). 
For first-timers to the the MGS franchise, what actually happens during gameplay is complemented by the numerous tapes you can listen to, and that gave me a lot of context about the universe. I finished nearly every main mission and a lot of the side-ops. I did not finish all main missions because I was playing on PS3, and in the meanwhile bought the definitive edition (including MGS:Ground Zeroes) for PS4. In the future, I definitely plan on replaying everything and finishing all main missions."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	"Massive MGS fan. I bought the original game on import when it was first launched on the PS.
Having played all the games over and over again and MGS4 being my personal fave, I have to say that I am disappointed with MGSV.
There are lots of excellent things about this game, the graphics are technically incredible, the stealth is up there with the best but I just cannot stand these farking sandbox games.
The game in a nutshell is just too boring, there are only so many times that you can save a wondering soldier or clear a mind field or go back to one of the key bases and rescue someone over and over again. It becomes tedious and a chure playing the game.
I've had this game since launch and just going back to it to finally complete it so I can sell it.
For a sandbox game to work - I have to feel the need to explore ad get engrossed in the world.
I've recently finished ZBOTW - this has no real story but the WORLD climbs the highest skyscraper and dumps all over MGSV - I couldn't put the game down because it was that awesome.
I much prefer the linear, story driven, action adventure, kick arse bosses in the old MGS games.
There are far better Sandbox games on the market (if that's what you like) but don't expect a gripping story line with this game and to be engrossed like the other games."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	Not to be that guy, but a game that receives a perfect review should not have any glaring flaws
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	"@qbkilla24 That's where you're wrong. You shouldn't see 10/10 reviews in games as perfect. Nothing in this world is perfect. You should see it as an ""exceptionally good title that goes beyond all expectations of the reviewer"". The reviewer finds it a perfect game. Have you never played a game that you were so amazed by that you couldn't stop saying how perfect it is? I have, and that game was Divinity: Original Sin EE. Reviews are just so subjective."

Control so smooth and polished, you forget you're playing a game. Systems so deep and flexible, it takes a long, long time to get bored with it. The story would only ever be a distraction in a game like this. You're free to make your own story.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	game play mechanics i give it a ten. Overall game deserves a 8 since it is incomplete and the second half is literally a repeat of the same missions but with difficulty settings on high. Whatever happened between Kojima and Konami shows during the second half of the game when you have to rewatch all the same cutscenes again.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/23/metal-gear-solid-5-the-phantom-pain-review	@SweatyHamWallet you werent wrong the game is very repetitive. i got burned out on the game and it wasnt until recently where i finally completed the game. Game mechanics are great with so many different ways to complete a mission. But like ive said before if you play through the first half that is pretty much the game since the second half is literally redoing those same missions but on higher difficulty settings no lie.

IGN please stop using your shitty ass video player. Tried to watch the review in 540p on a 60/gig internet connection which my laptop is plugged into via ethernet cable, no other apps running, nothing in the background.....still stutters and stops to load.
went to youtube, watched the review in 1080p with no issues. -_-"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	"@TheRealRyanBailey Oh Wow, you have really fast internet. Too bad your machine is probably a pos. But then again you're probably going to ""dic measure"" ign on that one too. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	@TAMOORE @TheRealRyanBailey He is not the only one to have such an issue. I have many PCs and I tried on different decent internet, that are able to run youtube HD videos, and the player is so so shity with IGN. Why you defending them, do you work with them. The video player is shity.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	@TheRealRyanBailey i have shitty internet and a 500 dollar pc from walmart and ive never once had a problem with their videos on 1080
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	Someone needs to make a game that plays like ActRaiser or Soul Blazer but in free roaming 3D, Anyone else like that idea? They came pretty damn close with Dark Cloud on the PS2.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	Thankfully, you don't need to understand the appeal of MOBA's for other people to enjoy them. I have never understood the appeal of Japanese anime and all of Sony's Japanese RPG's, but I understand that is just my opinion and that lots of people out there have different opinions and love them. Thats what makes the world an interesting place. The world would be boring as all hell if everyone shared the same opinion.

Speaking of anime...I think it's notable that due to being recorded in the same area as FUNimation studios (anime licensing/dubbing studio) /Okratron Studios
 (the video game-recording studio of Christopher Robin Sabat, the US voice of Vegeta, Piccolo, Yamcha, Shenlong - the holy dragon, Reacoom, the turtle, and 15 understudy/fill-ins on Dragon Ball Z, as well as the dubbing director for the Dragon Ball franchise), 
this game is chock-full of anime-dub voices.

Humorously enough, Sean Schemmel, the voice of a character called ""Son Goku"" in Japanese, voices a very different version of that character in this game, going by the Chinese name of that character ""Sun Wukong"".

I'm almost certain that Christopher Sabat himself directed the voie-over for this game; knowing 90% of everything there is to know about Dragon Ball may have something to do with that casting decision lol."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	Gotta disagree. It looks like a more light hearted approach, especially in regards to charcter design and character design is one of my favorite aspects to Smite. I love the whole Gods approach. Makes new characters incredibly interesting, especially if your a fan of mythology and such, which I definitely am.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	A game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	Send you an invite soon as I get home need people to play wit...no one listens at all, or even use there mics
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	"""costly upgrades"" you do know that my 500 dollar PC blows Xbox out of the water right?as in i have 4k capability (though not at the best performance), i play any game maxed out in 1080p and will continue to do so for some time right?The costly upgrades is a myth created by console peasants. That being said, keep dreaming about Xbox being unified with PC lol. PC was never a constituent of any Microsoft shit due to Microsoft not having a single say in what happens in PC gaming. Microsoft is ignored on PC, and with good reason. Xbox One has way more exclusives than PS4. Keep praising your peasant box with your dreams as the facts contradict you in every way lol."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	"My Xbox One cost $350, not $500, and it will continue to be able to play new Xbox One games indefinitely, which, if the Xbox 360 is anything to go by, will be at least another decade. In contrast, your $500 PC will not be able to play new, high-end PC games a half a decade from now, let alone a decade.
I don't have to keep dreaming: it's already happened. I earn Xbox achievements already on my Windows 10 PC, playing games like Project Spark, Minecraft: Windows 10 Edition, Halo: Spartan Strike, etc. And soon I'll be able to earn Xbox achievements in cross-buy + cross-play games like Fable Legends, Gigantic, Killer Instinct, Sea of Thieves, Halo Wars 2, Gears of War Ultimate, etc.
At least you're competent enough to know that the Xbox One has more exclusives than the PS4. Your mistake, however, is to think that Xbox is a console when it's been a device-agnostic platform since 2010 and counting."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	@ajbaj94 You sir, must have big dic if you have big computer. Big whoop. To each their own. Have you ever though ppl must enjoy consoles as opposed to sitting upright at a desk to relax? Close minded, ignorant, small dicked fuck.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/19/smite-xbox-one-review	The play station brand also disavowed any knowledge of you being associated with them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	Otherwise known as a joke. I guess people that just call everyone on the internet morons for no good reason don't get those usually though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	because they are reviewing the pc version
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	because they are reviewing the pc version
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	WOW, very similar to MGS:VR Missions. I actually enjoyed VR Missions quite a bit, and this looks entertaining.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	Not to bring it down, but none of these (indie) games matter to those who are playing The Witcher 3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	I stopped playing that game after the first week. It's great but, I got indies to play.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	What's with the .1, do review scores matter so much that they need decimal accuracy like its the result of some sort of precise formulae?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	Yup, reviews require 2 sig figs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	Just a tip for Brendan Graeber. Don't read your script so fast. It sounded like you were hurrying through the review. Great job otherwise.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	I might be a little biased but, I had more fun with The Marvellous Miss Take.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	It says Volume on PC right below the verdict.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	Another good game ruined by the devs god awful voice-over.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	What? I thought the voice acting was actually pretty good.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/18/volume-review	I cant stand the tone. He should just get someone else to do it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	I should have answered to the top comment instead of yours. Sorry for that. However, I had already read the rest of your comment and as someone who played the hell out of DAO, I think you are wrong. Plus I think FPS fanboys are playing an RPG that came in later in which you're in a 80's Chuck Norris movie. With the same quality of one dimension characters and story.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	This DLC actually looks like the best one yet. I hate the combat mechanics in Inquisition but I'm a Dragon Age stan with left over sentiment from Origins so maybe I'll throw money at this to relive the DA universe a while longer..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	It was not vary straight male friendly. the only straight romance option was Cass and she looked like a man. So I avoided romance options in the game. they catered to the LGBT community in that game.that is why I said Fanservice.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	"After mass effect 3 I believe that DA handles previous game continuation better(but not perfectly).In mass effect, in the end our decisions didn't matter, Mass effect 3 ended up being one giant ""dues ex machina"", Bioware obviously become stuck as there were too many variables to come up with a satisfying and consistent ending.
The callouts to previous games though were a little sad. They could at least give a small mission with a cutscene as a reference."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	Agreed Dragon age 3 was okay. but at the end of the day it was nothing to write home about.Witcher 3 the wildhunt had me form the start and we know fallout 4 will be game of the year.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	"I actually disliked Inquisition, it starts out strong but quickly looses me every time. The furthest in the game I ever got was Skyhold (pre-Empress assassination attempt), and I just loose it. Inquisition has a lot of empty space and lackluster ""fetch-quest"" sidequests, as well as respawning enemies.
It really did make me sad because I love Origins and even enjoyed DA:2, but Inquisition to me feels like a lot of fluff and show with very little meat. The best parts of that game were making decision in the Inquisition chair as well as the banter between party characters. I just hope the next Dragon Age games stop focusing on humans, they're boring unless they're from Tevinter. Dwarves and Elves are where it's at for me (Deep Roads for the win!)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	I agree I never beat inquisition it was too much fanservice if you know what I mean.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	I'm actually curious what you mean by fanservice, the most I ever saw was via the War Table where your decisions from the previous games supposedly had an effect (which was bullshit). It was all text-based call-outs which was just sad considering how the Mass Effect series handled multiple-game-spanning-decisions.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	Almost as much as I enjoyed your mom.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	you enjoyed that POS?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	Thanks but i'll wait for the witcher 3 DLC in oct. Then.............................................Fallout 4 baby!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	What a vague ending. Are they going to expand on the whole titan idea or leave us in the dark
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/13/dragon-age-inquisition-the-descent-review	Goodbye Ign
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	Why name your game 'Galak-Zed'?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	This footage makes me miss Sidearms at the arcade. :o/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	It's not like ikaruga, it's more about dog fighting being strategic in a fight than dodging bullet hells and learning patterns.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	ok sound way better than i tought
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	That sucks man. I hope I don't get to that point...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	It is best to fight everyone in this game rather than avoid, it gives you more chances for crash coins and helps you become proficient in combat. If you die, always start at the beginning of the chapter because you can cash in the coins you earn and have the robot form. It is usually not worth the gamble to continue because your robot form will be missing unless you can get to your equipment. I only died two times and both of them were on my first 2 hours with the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	yup.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	"""Drab environments""
uh... wat?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	Bought this earlier today as a birthday gift to self. Glad I did. Best $20 I spent on a video game in a long time. Everything about this game is a win...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	This game is awesome.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	Whoah. Games are supposed to be fun man.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/galak-z-review	I know. Hence, my reaction to certain types of games, which I specifically find *not fun*.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	I've just discovered this game. I love it. I've finished it and I'm still thinking about it. It's the most beautiful game place I've seen. Despite it's haunting atmosphere and I wander around soaking up the landscape. I especially love how the story is inconclusive and doesn't 'tell' you anything but simply reveals itself. It is a Visual story - a new type of game that most people probably won't understand. The mystery still enthralls me because I can't figure out exactly what happened. I love this type of game and it is for a particular type of player. I continue to go back into the game on a daily basis and walk around. It's very relaxing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	There are valid criticisms of this game, but I enjoyed the experience. Beautiful setting, talented actors, and interesting story. Some great moments especially the ending segments. I definitely don't mind spending a few hours with these types of games once in a while.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	I think I died & went to the rapture just trying to complete this story. Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaate.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	Just got a PS4 this week, and got this downloaded.  Its...odd, so far.  AND no way does R2 do anything.  I was holding that damn thing down for damn near a minute, it didnt do anything.....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	Also holding r2 doesn't do anything for me
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	@hobden87 Me neither....it sucks
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	Came here to see if anything does actually happened in this game but after half an hour of following a fucking light I'm done. I get games are different but there's no point to this
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	@hobden87 I even like indie games and I couldn't get into this. I've played games like Journey and thought they were great but this game... I wasn't interested in the story at all, the voice acting was okay but certainly not the best voice acting ever as Gamesradar put it. It just felt like the whole time the story wasn't really going anywhere. I was interested at first but then the game just moved on and on covering the same ground the whole time so I just quit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	45 mins into the game.. and I was thinking why isn't anything happening? Reading the comments I realized this whole game is just about walking and reading the story.. and nothing else.. @@  ok... I don't think I will bother finishing the game. too much of a chore to walk for 5 hours just listening to dialogues.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	@Emer005 I like indie games like Journey and I agree with you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	"While I'm not inclined to say I ""enjoyed"" this game, as it is quite depressing, it certainly was an experience.
I completed it in two sittings (found the sprint function quite soon actually, just checked button layout in pause menu) and got completely lost in the story, haunting score and beautiful countryside. It forced me to slow down and take it all in, as opposed to speed running through it. It was challenging for me at first but I sorta eased into it. And boy, those final moments near the end were really something..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	@ThatJerryBoi I'm thinking about getting back into it eventually. I quit and maybe permanently after the game glitched so I couldn't open one of those light things where you have to tilt the controller to hear the story.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	I've played an hour or two (at a slow pace - not that I have much choice!) and I must say I've found it to be disappointing. The game world is beautiful and reminds me of village life in the UK. The voice acting is good as well. I enjoyed games such as The Vanishing of Ethan Carter and Firewatch but honestly, I found this a little too boring and lacking in things to do. The slow movement is okay since I know they want gamers to take notice of the environment and appreciate it in all its glory. However it does become tiresome after a while. The main frustration for me though is there isn't actually anything of any substance to do. The game probably would have benefitted from having puzzles and more of a mystery to solve element. Either way, it's one of the few games that I've downloaded that I just won't finish. Shame really but hope others enjoy it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	"I have mixed feelings about this game. On the one hand I really appreciated the design, both visuals and sounds. I loved the atmosphere and the way the story unfolded. On the other hand, I found it a real grind once the novelty had worn off. Yes, there was a sprint feature implemented, but it's not near fast enough. The slow pace might be realistic but that doesn't make it better.

I suppose the best verdict I can offer is this: I'm glad I played it, but I'm also glad I didn't pay for it (got it free on PS+).

One other little thing that wound me up was the accents of the villagers. I heard west country, home counties, welsh and even a scouser - all in a game set in rural Shropshire! Surely it couldn't have been to difficult to have all the voice actors affect a local accent? It didn't affect the experience, but it was an avoidable and unnecessary flaw."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	@che_don_john Wait, there's a sprint feature?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	Read review
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	@indigolake @che_don_john Yes, but you have to hold R2 for seven seconds for it to work but even then it's pretty slow.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/10/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review	"@che_don_john I think having a sprint button that worked immediately and was twice as fast along with fixing those ""tilt your controller to open the light thing"" and just letting you press a button. I spent way too much time moving at 3 miles per hour speeds trying to get somewhere and trying to open those light things which on the last one wouldn't even open at all no matter how I tilted the controller. 2 simple design decisions fucked this one up imo."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	I just finished the game and I thought it was pretty good. I don't remember what I paid for it, but I would say that $4.99 would be the sweet spot. They're right that you can't die and your brother can't die either, no matter how long you wander around (so it's not like Dead Rising 2 where you're forced to keep coming back). I personally liked the relaxing atmosphere and the no-pressure wandering. I also liked trying to find the story clues and deciphering the pictures. It's a nice break for when you really are just trying to sit back and relax with a no-stress game. Definitely not going to be for everyone, but it's not a terrible game for those that can get passed the lack of violence, action or even a forced pace of any kind.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	I was having that issue, too. I thought it was the fact that it was running off an external hard drive, but I guess not. It wasn't very often, though. Usually just in the beginning when I first started playing the game or when I would rotate the camera around really fast.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	"my review reaches a similar consensus to be honest! would give it a slightly lower score, though...
http://journoverse.blogspot.co..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	Skyward Sword got a non deserved 10, he aint trippin.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	Flagged for racism.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	surprised it has gotten such a high score it is pretty much trashed on every format at metacritic from both users and legit reviewers. 41/100, 49/100 and 5.1/10. I have not even heard of it until i saw a twitch stream yesterday.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	No. But if you want to play it high, that is on you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	Great review Jared. I reviewed this and enjoyed it. So atmospheric and immersive
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	You know, if this game was a fiver, I'd have no problem dropping that, but its not, it's £12 (I think) with a PS+ discount. That's too much for this. Way too much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	"Indeed it does sound odd. Platinumed sounds better than 1K'd, lol. Perhaps the term ""Unlocked"" would be a better term? I don't know."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/submerged-review	Personally, I prefer 100%. It's pretty universal...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	Score seems about right to me... wasn't overly happy with the ending, but there isn't much in the way of gameplay or story up to that point.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	"That makes sense, if Indie meant ""make uP your own definition for the sake of fuck it."" Indie means independent, these games all received funding from major companies, you can see it what ever way you want, you can change the definition of what ever you like, in the end Indie=Independent, whether you like it or not. These developers were not independent. Clase close."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	So many pointless articles on ign that you missed some reviews.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	wow really 5.5
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	Sounds interesting enough to buy, but will wait until it's cheaper.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	I guess the reviewer didn't like it RAGE!! he just want to play cod all day and not give a f*ck about smaller and unique games are coming out right now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	This was one of the few games shown over the last few months that I really had no interest in. Just didn't appeal to me at all. So no loss really as I wasn't planning on playing it anyways.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	Lol don't assume there isn't more just because my sampling was games off the top of my head. Nice try at being derogative though dolt.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/07/beyond-eyes-review	"You're defining ""indie games"" by their publishers? Their financial support? I'm defining them based on their creative distinctions and independent elements; gameplay, artistic assets, themes, etc. We have separate arguments then."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/03/rare-replay-review	This collection sucks compared to the SEGA Genesis collection for X360/PS3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/03/rare-replay-review	BC and Windows 10 are enough reason to buy XBOX One. All the people that bought PS4 are watching it collect dust.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/03/rare-replay-review	Attempting to troll the XBOX One. A mediocre console? Son, ALL consoles are technically mediocre. And right now, the XBOX One IS the one to buy, given the integration with Windows 10 and backwards compatibility upon us.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/03/rare-replay-review	You are a Japaneeeese?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/08/03/rare-replay-review	"A so-so compilation with so many of their not so great games. Seriously, aside from Killer Instinct and DK Country, their games don't have much replay value.
I was seriously disappointed with this collection, especially how some games installed separately. Do NOT buy the physical version, if you plan on keeping it. The install will take forever.
The menu system is shoddy too. It's too busy and takes too long between all the fluff to go from one game menu to another."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	I like this style of review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	But it's not exclusive to the PS4, Its on the Xbox One and PC as well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	Yet another astounding PS4 exclusive I'm missing out on.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	"I will try it out just because it has a fat cute elephant in it. However it will be 2nd in my list after ""Super Panda Adventures"" thats been on my steamlist for a while."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	I've owned SNE NYSE for over 5 years. I've owned MSFT Nasdaq since the 1990s. NTDOY as well for a while. Big deal. You want to talk investing, that's great. But touting the sales of the PS4 as a reason its so much better than another console that offers me great gaming enjoyment as I am psyched for what Gamescom has shown me, is stupid fanboy drivel. Play games on anything, if possible everything.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	better than lost world and the lbp games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	"sony has some good ones as well
I suggest you try Puppeteer if you haven't already"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	You know, I actually bought that game when it released, and I still haven't played it. I've heard good things though. I have a lot of games in the backlog (and I do mean a lot), but maybe I'll play that one soon-ish.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	go play it it's outstanding
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	Think he's talking about the people who live in that region under the iron fist of a warlord.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/tembo-the-badass-elephant-review	You should try Super Meat Boy and Runner 2 great games but not for the light of heart.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	"I'm very happy that ""shock value"" choices were included in the cons. Glad that IGN emphasizes good taste too."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	Though the game was an incredible masterpiece, (or at least a 9/10) let's be honest here, Episode 4 WAS the worst one out of all. XD
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	I disagree with this review so much I thought this was a great episode
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	These review scores really made me look past this game for a very long time but I'm glad I finally listened to all the hype. It all blew me away. As a 29 year old dude I never knew a game about teenage girls would affect me so much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	Mitch seems like a good enough dude. Reviews are opinion pieces, not gospel. I dont fully agree with his assertions, but I guess I just let more go cuz i like the game a lot
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	I'm a late-comer to this game, but so far I agree with most of what Mitch has written. I'll give a more fleshed out opinion when I complete.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	My Max was not out of character. I recommend making better choices, reviewer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	@Shiek_2002 I don't even think it was the choices - I think he is flat-out wrong. Everything seemed quite consistent with the previous episodes to me. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	@televised-god @Shiek_2002 The reviews are all around sub par from IGN on this series, to the point where I used them as a reason why I didn't play this game for so long. But I tell you what, this game moved me in a way I was not remotely prepared for. It's really special, and I'm just not sure the reviewer really got it or clicked with it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	@Shiek_2002 @televised-god I sincerely agree. It is largely an old-school point and click adventure, and the gameplay is very slow, so I understand the kind of game is not for everyone. I expected to enjoy the game, thought the very first moments were interesting, but when you put your headphones in and music plays, really reminded me of my late high school, and early university career. Then I appreciated that it likely wasn't going to be action packed or exciting like any of the Telltale games, but more like Gone Home. Those sort of slow games are not for everyone and seeing from his criticisms about the game, I just don't think it is his style of game. Which is fine, but just means he probably should not have reviewed it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	@televised-god @Shiek_2002 It was like a coming of age indy movie that you got to control, with a good sci-fi gimmick. It hit just the right notes. :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	"Kind of disappointed in this review.  I think it was completely necessary to reset the timeline shortly after the beginning of this episode.  I've spent several hours playing this game, learning about characters, and working through mysterious events.  Drastically changing the timeline means all of that was for nothing.  I don't believe it was cowardly at all, I believe it was essential, and I think they did it beautifully.  I also disagree with the ""shock value"" comment.  This is a game about making choices.  Some choice options may have similar/identical outcomes, but more often than not as the player you have a decent bit of control over how Max behaves.  Not to mention this character is going through a long series of traumatic and transformative events.  This is the shit that causes people to change, and act differently.  I do agree that it got a little slow at some points, but not really that much.  And the evidence thing was not difficult.  I am by no means some ""super smart human guy"" and I completed that bit in a matter of minutes (probably between 7 and 11 of them) at 4am as my eyeballs burned from overuse and sleep deprivation was setting in.  There may have been a degree of tedium in there, but hey, at least they took the time to flesh out some actual facts and have you do the work to get there.  You are entitled to your opinion, Mitch Dyer.  But I disagree with it at pretty much every turn.  Maybe if you provide more specific examples supporting your assertions, I would be able to understand how your perspective was shaped. But since I can't, I guess I'll have to assume that you sir, are just ""hella cray."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	@PlagueMonkey Stop making sense, such things are not welcome in Dyer's reviews. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	Mitch, what the hell? Only a 6/10? Get real dude. This episode did have some moments that felt a little too drawn out but they aren't as bad as you make them out to be. This episode turns dark pretty quickly but I don't think that causes Max to act out of character. Oh, and as others have pointed out: you can click on the evidence while piecing the clues together in Chloe's room. You should be embarrassed that you didn't know that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/30/life-is-strange-episode-4-dark-room-review	I can't take Mitch Dyer seriously as a reviewer anymore after reading his take on these games. This is one of the most compelling stories I've played in a long time. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	In my mind, the only thing that I found bad about this game was the lack of a legit career mode. Besides that, it was a great game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	2013.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	pass on this one... play 2013.. the last decent f1 game..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	Lol! So was the comments section of the F1 2015 review was the natural place for you to come then? Troll along now buddy. You don't have to go home but you can't stay here!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	I guess you'd have to be a super fan to buy it so you probably will hear good things.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	this game is hated by the press but I only hear good things from people who actually played it. It does well what it has to do. It's a compelling F1 game that does what is possible in the strict boundries of the F1 license. Plus the AI is not really bumpy, you are obviously just terrible drivers. I would suggest giving it a 8.5+
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	Here's the thing: if you're afraid to say what you think because you're worried people will disagree, you're not reviewing honestly. You're just saying what you think people will want to hear. And considering that a lot of people are going to yell at us whatever we say about a highly publicized game (that's a given when we have as large and diverse an audience as IGN does) we believe strongly in saying what we really think.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	I don't disagree with anything you just said, but you completely changed the topic away from what we were talking about. I know you stand by your score as you are the Editor. I still think your site over-scored the game secondary to the hype surrounding it or Ryan's passion for Halo. Regardless, it is okay to disagree, I am not trying to attack anyone, just expressing my opinion as it differed from your original comment.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	"Standardization is impossible to do when it comes to scoring works of art. The closest thing you can do is to have one single reviewer, with the standard being his or her personal taste, but of course there are far, far more games out there than can be reviewed by one person, and that one person couldn't become knowledgeable enough about the huge range of genres out there to give an informed opinion on them all.
So you have to have multiple people to evaluate even a respectable fraction of the games that come out every month, and because each of those people is a human being with their own ideas about what makes a game good or bad, and because you cannot quantify ""fun"" in a way that's consistent from person to person it's not possible to have a uniform ""standard"" across multiple reviewers. I know it seems like it should be, but trust me: as someone who's spent the past decade-plus working in game reviews and banging my head against the same problem as every entertainment reviewer who's come before me since the invention of the printing press, I assure you it's not."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/29/f1-2015-playstation-4-review	I liked F1 2015, along with nba2k15.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review	Please don't pay money for this game, it was made with money stolen from another company that trusted in The Odd Gentlemen to help make their first game. They are thieving scum and you can read about it for yourself here or google it http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1075244

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review	Hmm that doesn't sound and look like one of those websites where people can write whatever rumor or drivel they feel like. Since everything you read on the Internet is true... No need to get another, more reliable source
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review	@Anniebird 1. It's NOT a news article, 2. IT SAYS IN THE FIRST WORDS IT'S A RUMOR, and finally 3. It's not like TOG is the only company behind the game, I'm supporting Sierra the original creators. So :P
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review	Sorry for the late response. But, you are SO correct. That's why I love Dark Souls. Almost no hand holding.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review	I've never played the original games, but this reboot is a blast. Christopher Lloyd is a treat, and the other actors are fun too. I kept waiting for the little knight to say 'inconceivable!' and he almost did a few times, but not quite ;) A nice nod to his Princess Bride role, without feeling forced.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/28/kings-quest-a-knight-to-remember-review	First episode was a blast. It was like playing one of the tale´s I read in my childhood. Beautiful world, amazing voice work and a very charming story. Loved the range of characters as well; and Graham´s puns while telling Gwendolyn the story had me cracking up, as silly as some were. Considering how long it took me, how much I enjoyed it and that it´s the 1st of 5, this is totally worth its bang for the buck. Can´t wait for episode 2.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	Looking forward to playing this when it's inevitably free as a ps+ game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	@DinkerMag when?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	"1. Look at the big picture and stop crying over the details. If an aircraft mechanic tells you there's something wrong with a plane, and a 14 year old child tells you there isn't; who are you going to believe? Obviously the person with credentials and weight behind his opinion. You have weight behind your opinion. Now please stop discrediting yourself.
2. ""It never told me I could run past enemies"". Are you kidding me??? Does your mother still make ""Chu chu"" noises with a spoon to feed you cereal? Hopefully not. If she does then your statement is a little more understandable. You would think someone who reviews modern games would understand them a little better. If someone came at you with a sword in real life, there would be at least three basic thoughts in your head; fight back, dodge or run. Games in the Soul's series respect the gamers knowledge, unlike 90% of modern gaming that will have 30 minute tutorials to show you how to walk, etc.
Since you're so enlightened by ""facts"", here's one: If you do not have the basic gaming knowledge or skills to push buttons and learn how to do things, or lack the thought process to think of solutions to problems games will inevitably throw at you, then you should be ashamed to call yourself a video game reviewer."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	"1. My point stated all reviews are opinions; All professional opinions are reviews. You are a professional. It was a review. End of story.
2. Your article was a first impression; correct. But many of the things you were stating as ""facts"" were not. When something is a fact, it is 100% correct. But the things you were talking about in the article were completely untrue. Do you not think your own word carries any weight? Apparently not."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	"1: Your point is factually false. Someone being paid to render an opinion does not make that opinion inherently better or different than an unpaid opinion - it simply means that the person being paid probably does this kind of thing a lot, and does it well enough that they've been able to find someone to pay them to do it. That is the only distinction. You can look this up in the dictionary, where you'll find no ""Unless that person is a professional"" caveats under the definitions of ""review"" or ""opinion."" But if you feel that way and are unwilling to accept dictionary definitions of words, then okay. Just be aware that your ideas about this concept exist only in your head, and other people will not know what you're talking about.
2: My article explained my experience with the game, as I understood it. It was, as it was headlined, the story of how Bloodborne lost me; if Bloodborne had done a better job of introducing me to its systems, my knowledge and impressions of it would have been different. It never told me I could run past enemies, for example. Souls fans know this from previous games, but I had no way of knowing enemies are designed to be so stupid and gave them the benefit of the doubt. Having only the information it was willing to give me, that was how I saw it, and that's why I stopped playing."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	"Yes, but they are not synonyms. All reviews are opinions; all opinions are not reviews.
Around here, a review is something written by someone with experience in a game's genre after they've played through the entirety (or as much as is reasonable) of its content. Generally, it is scored. This, by contrast, was an unscored first impression piece by someone new to the genre."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	I never said I thought it was frustrating, I'm just speaking up for Dan Stapleton, the internet is too quick to dash out hate on everything when it often doesn't deserve any. He's not the only one with that opinion and so what if he thought the game was unfair and too difficult. But here's incoming comment on why it was fair and how he's just not a 'real hardcore gamer'.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	"The fact that you think Bloodborne is frustrating tells me you've never experienced ""oldschool difficulty"". Believe it or not, there was a time where every game didn't hold your hand and spoon-feed you rewards."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	You made an article stating your opinion of the game. A review is an opinion, is it not?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	did i say flash sales are rare, or that GOOD SALES are rare. what an idiot
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	I'm sure plenty of gamers have been unprofessional. When it's your job though you should be subjective. Was there a big deal then? This is the first I've heard of it to be honest but I wouldn't be surprised if fans were upset about it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/the-vanishing-of-ethan-carter-ps4-review	Witcher 3 is one of the best games of the year. Get it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	Almost got this, 50% off today, till I read the review. Thanks for the heads up. I'll pass on the Random Grinding. Not for me....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	I love the grind.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	4.5 stars lost because of grinding? Really? Earthbound Beginnings was my first 8bit turn based RPG that I've ever played through and I only had to grind for maybe 2 hours total (I had 27 hours played after beating it) over the entire course of the game before I beat it. The rest of my levels came from just running around trying to get all the melodies. I feel like you reviewed this as if it were a game that came out in 2015 and not a JRPG from 1989. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	Giving a game a 6.5 out of 10 due to one flaw, seems a bit much. I finished the game in a few days. Yes there's a lot of grinding, but 6.5? The game is too good for that, and I give it at the very least a 7.5 or an 8. After all, we are talking about one flaw. Also, the game is from 1989, and you expect it to be perfectly balanced in every way? This game is easy compared to RPGs of the time. Grinding was the style back then. You don't seem to actually take that into account when reviewing the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	Its a really difficult game but it has a great charm to it... Earthbound just has some really clever dialogue. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	-_-
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	I downloaded this over the summer but took a break from it. I don't mind grinding at all, I'm used to it. I need to get into it and hopefully complete it so I can download Earthbound :) I don't think 6.5 is a fair score because a NES era RPG is bound to involve level grinding.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	"this is true to people who dont like grinding i love grinding so i love this game
but grinding or not its still one hell of a game"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	Yes I have played it. The session is a bit of a grind, although it doesn't go without some strategy or reward in the end. I think the fights can be a little more involved more than just 'attack' or just using 'magic' or in this case PSI. As far as grinding goes it is pretty helpful some areas like the zoo area the animals like guerrillas and tigers and whatever else can do alot of physical damage but with a little grinding and proper items to carry it becomes rather easy it gets a little slow going to the factory it is easy to get lost as the tile set is very much the same as the last frame. Other than that in my opinion Mother is a very great over-looked RPG. The SNES version is just as good, if not better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	"It doesn't sound like it has as much grinding as Dragon Quest, then.
Plus, I see that it's based on the old US prototype, with the added run button. That helps a bit, no doubt."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	"I played it on an old emulator on an old P.C. a 10 years back I was pretty impressed at the difficulty the grinding for the most part is necessary for learning new ""PSI"" abilities thats the only reason I grind. Melee weapons you can get are quite quirky and intriguing, the dialogue in the game is also pretty enjoyable full of what i consider to be some 'dead-pan' comedy in it; some of it is down right baffling.
The game is moderately difficult sometimes it can spike in fights really badly and can become one sided fast against you in some cases because of enemy PSI abilities. SNES Earth Bound is straight up awesome it is even quirkier, the animation and colors are way cool and vibrant and the fights are better too."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/24/earthbound-beginnings-review	Yeah, I'm 32 and used to love random battles when I had all the free time in the world (on rare occasions they felt annoying.) But after grinding through JRPGS for the last 22 years, I'm tired of random battles and tired of transitioning to a separate screen for battle. Some of the changes I'm seeing to the genre are refreshing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	"More of an emotional journey than a traditional ""game"" per se, but I really enjoyed playing it. Gorgeous graphics, amazing music and you can finish it in a 2 hour sitting. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	I got the game because someone told me it was an amazing game (glad I didn't read this review before I played the game). When I started playing, I didn't understand what to do, but the further I went into my journey the more I was stunned of the beauty of this game, the beautiful music, the experience. I love this game and the beautiful world I was placed in, in fact I felt sad my journey was over so soon. One of the best games I ever played, and I'll keep it in my collection forever to play again
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	The most underwhelming video game experience ever conceived. Want a proper indie that does what most this claims to do? Play Inside.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	"""moving story... powerful ending""


wtf are you people smoking? I just beat the game and I'm completely confused at the purpose of this game. No story, no challenge and no purpose other than holding forward on the control stick...

This game was basically a retro version of an Uncharted Game. Uncharted is extremely linear and un-challenging but at least has a story. Journey is like an extremely dumbed-down uncharted game. 

4/10"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	"@whodey69 My view exactly. Aside from the decent music (which I couldn't appreciate due it to being tied to such a boring game) and some pretty desert scenery, this is easily the most overrated game I have ever experienced. Couldn't wait for it to finish, just about all of the reviewers praises for this game just don't exist.

Don't know how to rate it because it's just so damn pointless. Maybe a 3 or 4/10"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	Those who criticize doesn't realize that journey is game of 2012. That time it was amazing game with detailed beautiful graphics. Some old games are sucks compared to nowadays games, but its still considered top games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	@Akanti This 'game' is just terrible. Limbo came out 2 years before Journey and is still an incredible game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	Got it free with PS Plus, vastly overrated. I just found it pointless and boring.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	Wow this got a better score than no mans sky this game sucks compared to no mans sky. This game is ok but you really dont do anything no exploration and not emotional at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	played it , short and overrated in my opinion. and your reward for beating it is starting at the beginning again. it kinda reminded me of the greek tale of sysyphus a sinner  condemned to roll a boulder up a hill then watching it roll back down again and having to start all over again. i only feel like playing it once though, im not rolling that boulder up the hill again.  i liked the music though
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	I finally got around to playing this game, free with ps plus. At first i didnt understand why it got really good reviews, but then i played it till the end in one sitting. This game is truly a masterpiece with a powerfull message in my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	@kls4eva Extremely overrated, couldn't wait for it to finish. Graphics aren't even that good.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/23/journey-ps4-review	Very, very boring game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	I struggled with the putting at first but once you understand that speed is #1 you get better.  Overall I like the game more than TW.  I'm not playing for fancy rewards, i just enjoy playing a perfect game. My first true full competition ( 74 holes ) I won with a -32 score so it is possible to put well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	I just bout it on the PS Store £3, pretty good deal! Also, its just like the first UFC game, it was good but it lacked detail and real depth, then the second came along and blew the first one out of the water. Just you wait!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	I like this game. I give it an 8.5 It is challenging. I don't know why it only got a 5.5?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	Boy, the way the writer skewered the game, i'm surprised it went above 5
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	Putting in this game is horrendous and needs to be sorted out otherwise that's it, never buying another PGA Game again. Utterly horrible making something that's worth 90% of your game so disgusting and poorly made.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	This is the most inconsistent piece of shit I have ever played!! EA sports should know by now that the ball does not back spin on greens when hitting out of the rough,(in fact, I've seen it back up more out of the rough than from the fairway) the wind does way  too much, a 5 mph wind is not going to move that ball 20 feet.  Rory shoul be ashamed to put his name on this shit. Hate hate hate this game!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	"So today they dump another pile on this already steaming heap. A 7.5 Gb download with nothing to show for it. Are Tiburon kidding, or just taking our money and laughing. Should put out the ""Kill Off Your Game For Dummies"" e-book soon if they want to keep a fan base."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	I've owned many of the Tiger Woods games and loved them. I initially passed on this one but just picked it up today for $16 lol. Gameplay and courses are great but the lack of character customization and licensed gear/equipment is very sad. Lack of modes are not cool either. I remember playing Tiger Woods games on the PS2 and 360. I would make a character, win millions of dollars and then play with my character against my friends characters. We would bet our in-game millions on called shots and skin games. My character had platinum watches on both wrists and a platinum grill. Those were very good times.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	@SuperCrazyNinja Tiger Woods 14 is still OK. At least Spodooski doesn't pack a sad every second hole in that EA game and can look like Spodooski should.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	Yea, I really wish PGA 2016 had more to offer. I feel like the old Tiger Woods games on the PS2 had way more stuff. They had customized victory/fail emotes you could unlock and character progression was awesome. You would get sponsors and get paid to use their equipment in games. It was pretty epic. This new one is okay though. I'm having fun with the gameplay. It's just seriously a shell of past Tiger Woods games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	What's so bad about this game? I haven't played it much, but this game is pretty good. The graphics are really realistic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	"They added game modes and courses.
They need to redo the review on this game!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rory-mcilroy-pga-tour-review	@cjs0070 How many courses/ modes did they add? And was it free DLC or paid? This is on sale right now, thinking of getting it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	"Ever since the new update, I cant even play online split screen with my friends because of lag. the internet I have is perfect. no other game I play lags like this one on split screen. used to not do it at all. now I cant even play a decent game with friends. game is fun and all, but lagging with friends aren't a part of ""having a good time"". Fix the lag and I may play more often. till then its a low rating for this game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	 I don't usually buy games, but my friend convinced me to get this one. After playing it for a total of 10 hours, I have found it to be extremely buggy. I am sure it is not my hardware as I am running on the latest MacBook Pro with max specs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	Best game I have played in a log time. I've put more hours into this 20 dollar game than any other game I have ever played. I love this game so much I decided to start a youtube channel as an excuse to play more lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	 Ign, the routers you use are probably bad, the servers are fine, now fuck off of this perfect game and re-rate it and give it a 10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	Finally found this gem last night on the Xbox. It's a blast

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	This may be the worst review I have seen from ign. I usually trust them a lot but this was terrible. First of all Xbox servers are laggy because this game wasn't designed for Xbox. As you see in competitive play for international tournaments they aren't playing on xbox's. And the cars are different and they do have strengths and weaknesses. In tournaments there are pretty much 2-3 cars used and that isn't for aesthetics. The octane is the most popular because it has the best design for the game along with ye batmobile and the dominus. And also flat cars like the breakout, are the best for freestyling and a car like the batmobile has the best flicking and cars on a tilt are good for dribbling. THOSE are strengths and weaknesses. Overall I'm very disappointed this should be a 10/10 review. I have over 500 hours and have had maybe 3 canceled matches. And they aren't even annoying. This game is beyond perfect and I have met very few people who actively dislike it. Good job ign you messed this one up bad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	100%, but they reviewed the game early on so it probably had some issues back then. Right now however, it is a masterpiece and I have never had any connectivity issues.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	@Cynosura  Ikr man. IGN SUCKS!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	Bought this after the free weekend and as much as I love the game, when I'm playing a season it's crashed 4-5 times in 16 matches. Very big bullshit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/rocket-league-review	"This game WILL NOT disappoint. If you're even remotely thinking that you will like this game, then you absolutely will. I have not seen the issues that some Xbox players are saying they are experiencing. 

The only glitch I ever experienced was when one of my friends got stuck on the roof of their car. It was quite comical seeing them zip around the arena upside down. Other than that, no issues with servers or framerate or anything."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	i dont know what but ign look s like they never let change to the GODZILLA GAME for new modes and dlc characters and stories to be had in the game in the future
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	play godzilla games here: http://mygodzillagames.com/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	I picked this up on the Playstation flash sale today for 12.00 - yea it has a lot going against it - as a 60.00 it is horrible- as a 12.00 game its not bad
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	@othervoice1 Im here for the same reason. Thinking of grabbing it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	@othervoice1 I came for the exact thing. To check out the review and see what people said. I'm very tempted at 12. You really think its worth grabbing just for a little go?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	@jpdelaghetto @othervoice1 looked pretty bad. I think I'll get Shadow of Mordor instead. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	@FatboyFresh @jpdelaghetto @othervoice1 After playing for several days, the impression I get from watching this review is that the reviewer didn't really know how to play the game, nor does it seem that he put much effort into it. Like where he talks about the defensive moves being useless. It is one of Godzilla's most useful moves, not just for nulifying enemy attacks and getting space from enemies too close for comfort, but for taking out massive swaths of realestate in a single move. Also, where he was talking about combat feeling like a spam race, That is not how you should play this game. You need to keep a slight distance, pick your moments to attack and do not stay in their face so they can just waylay on you. It really sounds like this guy hated it the second he put it in and was just trying to get through it ASAP. Keep in mind that its only in the west that the games review scores are mixed. In Japan its got glowing reviews, I love this game, personally. I really wish I hadn't watched this when the game came out, cause this was the reason I didn't buy it on release day... bad move on my part.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	@Nsanctuary @FatboyFresh @jpdelaghetto @othervoice1 I actually like the game but I agree with the reviewer that it's not good. Having your own strategy on how to play it doesn't make it good. It's still a completely limited game with outdated graphics and clunky controls. I've got no early idea why directional controls weren't mapped to the right analog stick, and extra attacks to the top bumpers. I love Godzilla, and I was looking forward to playing as Jet Jaguar and Biollante, but this game is super dull.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	Yep, the very reason why I never relied on IGN, so yes I'm with you on that also, and fully agree with you, as I said in a past post, IGN is only good for Cheats, Release Dates and Videos, Ratings and Reviews, forget it, they prefer to stir the pot and make people rage on them. {I wouldn't be surprised if they make bets as to which reviewer gets the most rage replies.)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	@JayT01 yeah is true me too ,i play for fun not for judgement.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	I'm my own critic when it comes to games, I never relied on n Reviews to make a choice, so many games in the past that ign or others gave a good rating to, often disappointed me, I prefer to judge my own, on my own terms.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	"I'm not defending this game or saying it's good, because it's really not, but if you are looking for a game to just play and cause senseless destruction (maybe not the best destruction) this game isn't half bad, I don't always look for games that are about campaign or story, sometimes you just got to get a game just to play it with no regard of story or anything like that, just have fun and well see if you can beat your own record or others record just to say. ""HA beat you sucker!!"""

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	Played it at Comic Con and it reminded me both graphically and gameplay wise of the old PS2 game, War of the Monsters.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/godzilla-the-game-review	Angry Joe gave this a 2/10. IGN is being generous.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	For 40 bucks they need to stop all this short crap and build a new 8-10 hour story to go out with a bang.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	Arkham City's base game had challenge maps and predator missions that you could play with Robin, Catwoman, and Batman. AK you have to pay for that even though they are already in the game and that DLC isn't even available yet. How does that make AK a better game?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	I didn't even play the challenge stuff in any Arkham game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	@Fr33climb  you can now play as red hood, batgirl, batman, robin, nightwing, azrael, and harley on any AR challenge map. with that addition id say arkham knight improved on city and made literally every element of the game play superior. the only thing city did better is story which is why its still my favorite of the 3 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	Way too short. Decent at best.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	Glad I stayed away from this. I'll just wait for the Arkham trilogy box set to play these DLC's, although if they actually made a great DLC like say a full sized Gotham map with Jason Todd in proper Red Hood costume and a motorcycle to get around and decent story I'd get it......but that will never happen, just more crappy cash grab hour long missions I guess.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	regardless of how long it takes to release it all theres no guarantee though there is enough content that will be released to justify 40 dollers worth, and if this dlc is anything to go by there certainly wont be.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	I'm reading through comments now that I just bout this game. I looked through the DC we've had so far and found $10 worth that I would buy, but I shouldn't have to since they are the challenge maps. Most of them are just skins.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	His voice and dialog were dumb and gave him away instantly to any Batman fan, but the game overall rocks. :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	Thankfully this is the only one they didn't/aren't doing, or so I have heard. Hope so.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	It this all that is out? I mean besides the day one stuff. I think the season pass maybe worth it, new villains invading and new stories, but not if they are all this shallow. We have a huge world already built, use it. The Burton stuff isn't out for season pass holders is it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	thats one of the problems i would have if the new villains are just invading the existing world. its already built, ive paid for that, having new characters running about in it maybe kl but def not worth the asking price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	Barbara as Batgirl gives WW a run for her money as my fav heroine. Such a great character! that alone makes this a worthy buy imo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/14/batman-arkham-knight-batgirl-a-matter-of-family-dlc-review	i prefer Casandra Caine, barbara is kl but i could just not buy her as Batgirl.

Never played 1 & 2 (I was a xbxo 360 owner for this generation) but really impressed , graphics stood up amazingly well in the remaster and the action is great fun

Story probably didnt resonate aswell for me like the review would suggest but still got how Kratos felt 

Waiting for GOD4 now so i can smash Thor up :)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/god-of-war-3-remastered-review	It’s reviewers like this that really make you question your own version of reality. Hey look, there’s nothing wrong with having an opinion, we’re all entitled to our own and invariably they will differ. That’s not the issue. It’s that somehow, annoyingly, those with a marginal opinion end up with the largest platform and say things that piss many of us off. Remaster or not, God of War III was in many respects a masterpiece. It re-wrote the rule book in terms of digital game art and for what could be eeked out of the PS3. It was epic in almost every regard, and the storyline? The storyline was simply incredible; a true crescendo for the trilogy. It was fearless, bold and inventive, a sick twisted Kratos-centric bloody fantasy which saw our protagonist destroy all we know of established Greek mythology. The brutal, merciless and systematic slaughter of the Gods of Olympus, ending with the death of Zeus by Kratos’ hands (your own) was quite simply a phenomenal concept. The gravity of which is lost on those that don’t, or can’t, see it in context. Where in the history of storytelling does one murder the Gods; not one but all of them, in succession – beat their faces into the ground? It’s an incredibly original and innovative narrative.And now this narrative exists, and only for Kratos the God of War. It sets the scene for using other defunct religions as further God of War landscapes, as is now the case with God of War IV and Odin, with the Norse backdrop. If God of War III was a movie I’d be glued to the screen, if it was a book it’d be gripping, I wouldn’t be able to put it down - but it’s better than that. It’s a game so you become it. And that’s my gripe with this review. Meghan called the story ‘ Meh’! That’s right ‘Meh’! Meh? Wow!! Look, have an opinion but don’t just blast off like that! It’s possible that you didn’t get it and it just went way over your head! And you know, perhaps what’s required to truly appreciate the masterpiece that is and was God of War III is the savagery, barbarity and boldness within that connects to the player. Some balls one might say! Try as we might, some of us will always fall short in that regard.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/god-of-war-3-remastered-review	"I just got a PS4. They're having a sale for this game. I've never played any God of War but for $8, I don't mind buying this.
The only thing stopping me is do I need to play the previous two to understand what's going on or can I jump right into 3?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/god-of-war-3-remastered-review	Depends on how much you value knowing the story. This is the third game of an overarching trilogy that picks up right where 2 left off. But honestly GOW 1 & 2 might be difficult to play. They came out for the ps2 and the graphics are super dated at this point (and I thought this when I played them during the PS3 era), but if that doesn't bother you then I would give them a shot.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/god-of-war-3-remastered-review	It's cross buy so if you have the ps3 version the upgrade to ps4 is free anyways I thought

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/god-of-war-3-remastered-review	Story might get confusing because it picks up where 2 left off. Wow I had no idea GOW 3 would take place after 2 but before 4. Good catch IGN. Too much water.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/13/god-of-war-3-remastered-review	@kdnist  Did you read the ENTIRE sentence, or just part of it?  The reason he critiqued those aspects of the story was because this is the FIRST God of War game to hit PS4.  (PS4 is a lot of people's first PS console, so anyone who hasn't played the first two and the spinoffs is going to be confused by GOWIII's story.  The criticism was that this was a weird place to start remastering them.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	Don't care how long it takes this game just screams pt 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	I just got this game a few months ago and it is whole heartedly awesome! I love this thought of a game and need to see a sequal. Although maybe a better story? Two player arcade as well and maybe 6 fighters from each series? (Playable not support) but love this game otherwise (if the creators are watching please I know you can do it )
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	I bought this game awhile ago from Japan, it is very fun IF you are a fan of the anime shows/mangas. I love fighting Ichigo/Goku or Luffy/Naruto its like a geeks dream ha-ha!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	if only it was for Xbox One then i could enjoy this game and also all the other anime games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	This game is extremely fun, I know every character in the game, yes I read all of the manga before the game came out just so I know how everyone is. They got everything right and believe it or not they put a lot of heart into it, including the stages and characters if you ever actually look it at. Sure their budget for the game probably wasn't the highest but how else are you supposed to come up with a game mechanic that lets you use all characters across Shonen? They can't just bring out a Street Fighter or Marvel vs. Capcom clone, they actually tried something different and to me as a huge fan of fighting games and anime/manga I say it's amazing and the most fun I had in such a long time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	"""J-Stars Victory Vs.+"".... What a terrible name for a game.... They could have easily just named it Shounen Jump Victory or whatever.

Low budget game that just wants to cash in on the popularity of these characters."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	Don't give this game so much thought. Its more of a party game than anything else. Similar to Smash Bros. Its more fun as a game to just mess around in with your friends. The appeal in this game is entirely on the fact that you can play as your favorite shounen heroes and beat the crap out of your other favorite shounen heroes. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	I don't follow anime or anything like that. Pretty much have no idea who these characters are aside from having heard of Goku. That said me and my buds have a blast with this game. It's absolutely chaotic and absurd. Everything is overly dramatic and feels like you are always doing the biggest ultimate combo you have ever seen. The story mode is brutal but if you want to have fun with your friends mashing away I highly recommend.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/10/j-stars-victory-vs-review	Playing with luffy is actually awsome, He's one of my main characters
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	I astral-project two or three times a week, and it looks NOTHING like this! I'm incredibly disappointed that they failed to capture the essence of my hobby... I give it 3 disembodied souls out of 10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	But IGN gave it a lower score, so did most sites.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	But Gamespot gave it a 7/10 so did many game sites.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	it does look pretty interesting plus the art style is amazing. usually indie games go by price sometimes
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	I was hyped for this game ...to bad I'll just wait till it lowers its price..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	it hasn't fully left yet.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	Wasn't this an Ouya game? That explains it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	"Merely a joke...take a deep breath.... Now, that said, how Call of Duty which has done very little on the creative side manages to consistently get very positive reviews is beyond me. Does this game deserve a positive review? I have no idea. But COD certainly has had more than its fair share and I dare you to name a single week since Destiny's release that it hasn't had at least 2 articles pertaining to the game...and suspiciously low coverage on the infamous interview of ""if I showed you a video of the emotes, you would throw money at the screen"" that basically told first-time buyers that they would have to buy the game again to get the additional content. Bungie has ""apologized"" since then, but IGN has been strangely absent from one of the worst moments in PR gaming history since Gearbox's claim that their E3 footage wasn't false advertising for Aliens: Colonial Marines. To sum up, maybe this game doesn't deserve a positive review, but those others sure in hell didn't deserve the ones that they got. Just my opinion...it's just nice to see someone try something a little different...and perhaps the puzzles were geared towards a younger demographic."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	Wow Ori and the blind forest!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/02/whispering-willows-review	I love the art work !!! Wish it was a rpg!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	Well iam Brazilian and here the games cost so bad its like $50 for some games like watch dogs 2 mortal kombat X (R$200) and i found this game for (R$100) that here its like $10 for you it‘Really worthy and by the way i saw it for 200 for xbox 360 and100 ps4 iam writing by my PS4 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	Found the disc at U$10,think im gonna buy it,seems worth for the price
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	"wtf are you talking about? I pay Time Warner every month to play online. That's not free. If I buy PayDay2 for console, odds are I'll already have paid for the online service for other games so you could say that it's free for PayDay by your logic. It's not like someone says, ""Hey, I'll buy xbox live gold so I can play PayDay."""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	Why wouldn't you blame the devs? If they can't program for the consoles properly, then don't do it. Don't half ass it and say oh well, it's broken, who cares?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	Yeah, it's sad when users have to go and find workarounds for a broken game because the devs can't/won't fix it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	"That's the entire Overkill crew you're talking about. That's why they don't update consoles or really even care if the game is broken for them. Their response is ""if fans really like the game, they'll go buy it for PC"""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	No problem, glad to help. And sorry for late response, have been away for some days. Hehe yeah I know what you mean, still got a lot of games waiting to be finished. But this one is easy to pick up and play from time to time, or grind as I have been doing since release. Well yes at least give it a try, it´s a lot of fun for the money!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	yeah i hear you, its basically unplayable
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	I think they already put payday 2 on ps plus, but they might treat crimewave as a seperate game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/07/01/payday-2-crimewave-edition-review	Can anyone tell me if this has been fixed yet on X1?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	Why did this get a 7.6 on the PS4 and a 9.0 on PC. Was it because of two different reviewers, or because the PC version is just that much better? Any answers are much appreciated.\U0001f44d
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	It often depends on the effort put into the port. Smite plays amazingly well on Xbox One, though it was originally developed without consoles in mind. It's the same for a game going from console to PC...the amount of effort and interface logic put into the port can truly make an enormous impact on the success of the game on the platform to which it's being ported.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	Since the game is FREE, they already have their motivation for making it better. The only way they make money is if you like the game and choose to pay for additional content.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	nice thing about BF is just jumping in and getting right into some action. this game can have long stretches of down time, and exp grinding that does not involve exciting combat. i feel PS2 is superior overall, but the community is just too small, and the game... a snore fest without large scale battles.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	your right - his review should be almost a full point higher. that is a fishy # given the tone of the review
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	i'll give you that - this game is orders of magnitude better than destiny. destiny may look better, and i do love the bullet physics - but damn - destiny has no depth, where as PS2 actually offers something unique and compelling.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	This game is completely different from Destiny, I played Destiny for a long time and I'm Just waiting for New content, so I'm playing this. They are completely different games. One has a focus on large scale PvP battles, the other is more of a cooperative deal. Not bashing just pointing out that it is an unfair comparison.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	nonsense. its a big video game people can spend 100's of hours on. of course it needs to be fully reviewed, critiqued, and hammered where it fails. PS2 is great in many ways - that doesn't mean this type of game couldn't be made better. and how does that happen? though meaningful complaining.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	"i disagree, best part of the game is figuring everything out. once you do - the game becomes very repetitive. PS2
does a lot of things really well, but it needs a huge community to for the large scale chaos to happen. unless this game catches fire well after its release, this game will not have a long run on the ps4"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	this game has no community. shame too, game can be fun - they should have started with 2 servers. i'm not convinced the community could successfully fill one. without large scale battles this game is pointless. just wandering around a wasteland of repeated templates, and sterile environments. very few battles are balanced, and this game has one of my least favorite qualities - the more you play it the more lame it becomes. I can't stress this enough though - without design to keep things interesting for solo players and small groups, this game is worthless without a large community. frustrating game, regardless of its f2p nature.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/26/planetside-2-ps4-review	you do know what sandbox gameplay means? they give you tools, you decide how and when to use them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	"""Good""? This game is a masterpiece. The atmosphere, the graphics, the combat system. 
I've played over 80 hours of DmC Devil May Cry and even though it's pretty enjoyable while easy, I feel much more challenged in Devil May Cry 4. 
This game resembles a far more solid experience of Devil May Cry. Enemies have natural movement and unpredictable attacks. This makes the game much more interesting. On DmC5 (let's just call it that) the lesser demons are far too easy to fight against with their slow, repetitive and easy to dodge attacks. 
I have 40 hours of gameplay on DMC4 and I still haven't mastered Nero's Exceed system which is one of the coolest features in the entire franchise. The Bloody Palace mode on DmC is much easier and repetitive. It gets challenging at around level 80."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	"Every game has an impact on a person's life. I felt a much greater impact from DMC4 rather than DMC5 even though I played it a few days after its release not knowing anything about the rest of the franchise. Playing DMC5 first helped me see it as a standalone game and not part of a series. My overall experience in DMC5 was just fine. I did not have any experience with DMC. After playing both games, I concluded that DMC4 offers a better experience than DMC5. It's really a complicated matter and you have to take many things into account. Combat in DMC5 is different. Everything has become easier. You can flash to an enemy or bring them to you, you can evade at any given moment and the enemies' attacks are slow and very predictable. Parrying has also been added. You can stun an enemy by timing your attack to theirs, even redirect enemy projectiles. These are some nice additions. After I was introduced to Exceed in DMC4, all these attacks felt empty. Too simple. There are obviously less moves in DMC5. Dante is a simple killing machine with a limited number of attacks, still deadly and handy enough to dominate his enemies. But that's just it. The game should have been all about style. Killing enemies without getting hit and using a variety of combos while avoiding the use of a same attack twice. This is entirely possible on DMC4 but not on DMC5. The combos of the Red Queen in DMC4 are stylish and very adaptive. It has more combos than the Rebellion in DMC5. DMC5 forces you to use the same attack more than twice in some situations where brute force is required. Like the stupid Rages or the bosses. When you have a giant ape with a knife, you just go into his face and spam rebellion. The Axe has no aerial combo and the Fists have only one aerial attack. The Osiris and the Aquilla are practically useless due to their very low damage and minimal impact attacks.
The actual difference in these two games for me, is the atmosphere. That is what makes DMC4 an amazing game. It's the kind of game that draws you into its world. DMC5 did not give me that feeling. Just raw action."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	@ActionGamer97 I know this is an older post, but have you played Bayonetta 2? I love DMC4 and then played DmC after Bayonetta 2 came out and it just didn't hold up for me. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	will there be further updates? like more costumes or stages... but then again, they may as well make a new game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	""" The fact that you can respec a character’s moveset at any time is great, too – if Capcom was going to pull any forward-thinking feature from the rebooted DMC, I’m glad it was this one."" Really now IGN? That was always a feature of DMC4. Stop trying to give credit to that reboot where it isnt due"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	by adding shoe-horned challenges like Style May Die? no thank you
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	"Again it was in DMC4 and DMC has always had LV2 - 3 moves (and before DmC they were mostly made around being more useful by being faster or covering a larger area instead of being a lazy damage buff) just in 4 and DmC the last few upgrades are very costly so they let you refund so you can swap something you may not use for something you will, not because the devs thought you'd do a dumb challenge run (You'd just start a new run of the game for that).
White souls barely count as leveling because they're just proud souls that make everything cost the same when you have enough to afford an upgrade, with the amount needed going up with each upgrade (Like DMC4) just because it has a bar doesn't make it some new and original special RPG element, it's just what was already there with a different coat of paint on it (infact it's more exploitable in DmC because you could grab all the super powerful upgrades first and drop and by the time the upgrades start to take time to build all that will be left is the useless gun upgrades)
If the devs made the moves too overpowered once upgraded it's because they shoddily balanced them (Which it is), the only reason they're more aggressive is just because you're giving them more chances to attack you because you're not using all of the tools given to you by the game.
And again, giving a self made handicap on a game will make any game harder, it's just like the people in the kingdom hearts fanbase who will claim KH2 is so hardcore all you have to do is play on critical and turn on the lv1 upgrade and never use the handful exploitable ability the game will give you."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	DmC:DE is actually harder. Just so you know.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	"Hey look, I did the same thing in DmC vanilla on Hell&Hell. Ended up with an A.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?...
I have a feeling the player INCREASE the power of the Demon Evade to make it LOOK that easy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	"Also the enemy attacks in DMC4 isn't as telegraphed as DmC,""
They kinda are, almost even one of them (except for the chimera assaults, I hate those things).
DMC4 is much harder since its tough to stay in the air."" Just because it's harder to stay in the air in DMC4 doesn't mean the overall game is harder.
""the example you used for easier enemies in DMC4 was Dante's first level.""
Plus these,
https://www.youtube.com/watch?...
https://www.youtube.com/watch?..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	"""when you should have all the upgrades it swaps.""
Sorry, I don't use ALL upgrades. Since as Damage increase on moves and abilities, and moves that upgrade by gathering up more enemies. That RPG element was never in a DMC game, it's a shame to use it, and those are mostly for newcomers or people who want to past through the game and get high ranks/points easily.
I once try it out for the first time a month ago on mission 11, and I didn't like it. It made Dante felt way overpowered and it felt uncomfortable. Since then I avoided ever using it. And what I've noticed without, the enemies actually become more aggressive."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	Give me a reason to. They've given up on all of their main IP's, most of their new ones are shit, DMC 4 was shit and yet they brought it back with nothing but graphical updates and they expect us to be happy? It was an unfinished game to begin with!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	And that excuses making stuff up. Are you still in middle school or something GL?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/23/devil-may-cry-4-special-edition-review	"Yes, because that has everything to do with the topic at hand. Let's pull out our anger every time capcom ever gets mentioned. That will do something other than make me look like an entitled gamer!
Dude, it's not like Capcom made pacemakers or other lifesaving technology. yes, they are scummy, but yes you are blowing this way out of proportion.."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	Another lame rating from Daniel Crupa.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	I just went onto this because I wanna read this anyways I'm gonna get poochy and yoshis woolly world with the poochy amiibo at eb games😃 but is there a game I should get other games like kirby planet robobot super mario 3D land sonic boom fire and ice and more can anybody give me suggestions on what to get I only play on 3ds and laptop pc and I have preordered mafia III
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	@Sanicthehedgehoge Definitely Kirby: Planet Robobot and Super Mario 3D Land. Sonic Boom: Fire and Ice is fun too. I really enjoyed uzzle & Dragons Z + Puzzle Dragons Super Mario Bros Edition, Azure Striker: Gunvolt, and Paper Mario: Sticker Star.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	"I'm with most of the commenters here (and less with the reviewer)- this is a great, underrated game.  The details alone are worth the price of admission, like when the ""chicken egg"" boss recovers from a hit and his pants knit back together as he returns to the foreground.  The game looks like nothing else I've ever played and in this ""seen it all"" era, that's saying something.

Anyone who finishes the game in eight hours didn't take their time and I guess that's fine if you want to see the ending and say you merely finished the game.  My wife and I spent a few hours on the game to get through everything and have now spent about three times as many hours going back to all the levels to collect everything.  This is important because finding all the flowers means unlocking extra levels that are oftentimes a lot of fun.

If you like 2D games, Mario games, etc., this is one not to miss.  Especially for those who think the Wii U is a disappointment because it has few great titles.  Guess what?  This is a great title."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	"This game is amazing. Very underrated.
Plays like NSMB U, but in a world with its own quirks and style. Also more focus on exploration and collecting."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	Same game as many previous titles such as New Super Mario Bros, with a few changed mechanics (aiming with yarn balls). The review is fair imo. Although the graphics are certainly nice.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	Lol judging by the entire review minus the verdict, I'd have thought the score would have been quite a bit higher... like maybe an 8.5.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	oh and mario world 3d world wasn't a bad game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	too much water
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	On World 3-6. Game is amazing. This review is such a steaming pile of shite
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	just completed. Took my time and 100% the first two levels then got impatient and just played through the rest. It's a great game. A solid 9 with room for more if the special levels in World 3 and on are as good as the first two. Do NOT believe for a second it's a 7.4. I didn't play co op but from watching videos it looks like people have a blast
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/22/yoshis-woolly-world-review	"So I took a while to buy this game after reading the mediocre reviews.

I should NOT have waited so long. It's great! I make sure to collect all of the wool and flowers before moving on to the next level (which unlock Yoshis and bonus worlds respectively). Doing this keeps the game really fun. I usually only have to play through a level once or twice to find everything as I take my time going through.

There are more than a few great levels. I think most of them are pretty good, and some really shine. The first world is weak (especially the first few levels), but it seems to get progressively better in each world. Make sure to get all of the flowers as the special levels are the game's highlights. 

I can understand if you just go from one level to the next finding this game a little boring, but if you take the time to look around and collect the wool and stars, it's a rewarding game. It also has all kinds of clever uses for yarn and looks incredible. My only gripe is there is absolutely no story or dynamism in the overworld at all, like even worse than Mario which usually has some cut-scenes, and events to keep things exciting after clearing a world...

Overall it's a [8.5-9.0]/10 IMO."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	"i had to write a video game review for school and i cant find anywhere to post it besides here so

Batman Arkham Knight brings an exciting Franchise series to an end. In Batman Arkham Knight you find yourself in an abandoned Gotham City only filled with rioting thugs and supervillains. As you fight your way through Gotham you will face challenging foes and battles.


The game has stunning graphics while sounding phenomenal and introduces the well-known batmobile as a key component to saving Gotham city. You fight alongside Catwoman and Poison Ivy but also your trusty sidekicks Robin and Nightwing enabling a team up element to the game bringing down sinister villains such as the Riddler,Scarecrow and even Penguin while adding mind blowing combat move mechanics.This is only a fragment of what you can do in this game, you will find yourself in situations and sequences that will add much more depth to batman Arkham Knight.


The gadgets are another key element which are quite amusing to use while also being handy in the game. In the game your opponents try to come up with many ways to stop you in your quest to save Gotham, batman however has many tricks up his sleeve to bypass such trojan horses and be badass while doing so. Some gadgets can manipulate your enemies into the palm of your hand while others can pretty much render their weapons useless to a strategic attack, the controls are standard and if desired can be changed."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	@CarlosMedina  Nicely written, man! Keep writing!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	I just finished this and loved it overall . The tank fights did get frustrating during the main story. It wasn't the actual fighting , but just the sheer number of times you were forced to engage in these. One of my favorite games this generation. [Editors Note: I'm a huge Batman fan].
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	I don't think this guy actually read any of the comics as not only was the bat tank in them, but in certain ones he actually did kill people. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	batmobile is beast ..i really dont get it why everyone hate it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	Wanted to like this but really didn't. Mostly because of the bat mobile. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	@FatboyFresh It may feel like that at one point, but then you remember how repetitive things got with the same formula after 3 games in Origins and you are glad again that they mixed up things a little.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	Bat Tank is actually used in some of the comics.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	Batmobile should be completely optional, I felt like it was a hindrance to the game. Want in here? Use bat tank, want in there? Use bat tank. Got annoying fast.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/19/batman-arkham-knight-review	A great game, super rich in content, surely a 9/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	I'm level 12 and I'm enjoYing this so far.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	@youngspark91 is it true you cant loot enemies like the real games? If so that sucks
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	@tyjman23 @youngspark91 You can loot enemies. But not every enemy you kill will have stuff to loot but most will. Happy to answer any questions you have on the game. Have put about 200 hours into it in the past 2 months haha
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	@tyjman23 @youngspark91 Plus if you kill a lot of enemies at once you do not have to go body to body looting. The game will put all the loot from the dead enemies into the inventory of the first enemy you try and loot so you can grab everything in one swoop.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	@Legend_of_Link27 @tyjman23 @youngspark91  hmm yea but I liked seeing what a Npc is wearing and knowing hmm if I kill him I can take his stuff he has. I hope the next elder scrolls has co op not mmo and on a similar engine to skyrim.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	"@tyjman23 @Legend_of_Link27 @youngspark91 I see what your saying... no it does not work that way in ESO. I hope the next Elder Scrolls game goes balls to the wall on graphics and stick to a single player setting. While also having continued expansions for ESO for those who want an multiplayer experience..... 
I hope red dead redemption 2 has campaign multiplayer. I am pretty excited about RD2 next year."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	"@Legend_of_Link27 @tyjman23 @youngspark91  you wouldnt like if they added like a co op world drop in? like enter the same world as your friend,,, explore, do quest, or just fight and compare characters?
Yes I am very excited about RD2, Battlefront 2, and spiderman"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	@tyjman23 @Legend_of_Link27 @youngspark91 Ya that that would be a nice feature but If it came at the cost of better graphics I would rather just keep it single player with the best graphics possible and get my multiplayer Elder scrolls fix through ESO. I really am happy I bought it. I had no idea that I would be 200+ hours in after 2 months. Feel like I have gotten my moneys worth. It is one of those games that you think about playing even when your not playing. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	@Legend_of_Link27 @tyjman23 @youngspark91  Gameplay over graphics at an extent for me I think. Maybe I will try out ESO. Can you join the dark brother hood at least? And kill NPC? And is there stupid ppl running around ruining the experience?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	Really, an 8? I played this up until level 23 and I got bored, none of the main questline was fun or memorable for me; if I didn t have any context as to what was going on I would have thought they were side quests. Also the first dungeon I played was also very boring, there are multiple roles that the game assigns you to, tank, dps, and Healer. In the end none of the roles mattered since every enemy and boss was just a blade sponge in a different skin. Then there is the matter of weapons and gear. NO DIVERSITY! All the lower level weapons look the same, I couldn't find any in quests or drops that looked different or had some special ability, I grind a get the same sword with more damage, same goes for armor (although it is a little better) The combat feels fun up to level 10 when constantly button mashing gets boring and dull, which brings me to the skills, classes, and races. All races have ceartain specialties and skills so do classes (there only three by the way) making it very hard to enjoy playing when your race basically decides which class you should be. Example: Kahjitts are good for making a stealthy thief build so the skills are based around it are for stealth, there is only one class that encourages stealth combat which is the Nightblade class. So what happens when I want to be a warrior and a cat person? I get a mix of different skills that don't compliment each other at all, you end up using only one side of the skills instead of all of them. The graphics are terrible for a modern game, that's definitely not a big one considering everything else but it's still a problem. Last but not least this doesn't even feel close to an ES game. The big thing with ES games is the world building that happens and revolves around you. Apparently nobody wanted to put work into that so we are stuck with a faux Elder Scrolls mmo. I wanted to like this so bad I pushed myself to play it, I love Skyrim and Fallout 4 so when an mmo made by the same company set in the Es universe is realeased I buy it. 60 dollars and no enjoyment later I pm writing this to warn you. Unless you really really think you will like this DONT BUY IT especially not for full price. Also disclaimer I don't care if you like the game or not this is my opinion, you have yours I have mine and we can both respect that. Score 5/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	Not saying you're wrong and you are right everyone has their own opinion but keep in mind this is a MMORPG, if you have played other MMORPGs then you should understand why this game is not like the other Elder Scrolls franchise , all the other Elder Scrolls games are not multiplayer. Its core is in the PVP/Raids dude. Generally most MMORPGs end game play is in the PVP. Perhaps you are more of a RPG gamer. In addition regarding the diversity of gear styles you can get wicked looking gear but like every MMORPG you have to be patient and farm for motifs of styles you can create for gear you have crafted/found.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	Great game, first time i enjoyed being a healer (with assassin/nightblade base class)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	good game 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	I played this game for about an hour and got bored so I went to You Tube to watch the ending. It was fair but not as awesome as I thought it would be. I only paid $4.00 at Walmart so can't bitch too much I guess. Kind of boring though but for that price what the heck. I also got Dragon Age Inquisition for a dollar so can't go wrong there either. Hope it's better than this game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	Game doesn't work, absolute crash fest from day one, over hyped nonsense
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	DO NOT BUY THIS GAME unless its very very cheap.. very slow in PVP full of cheats.. quests are nearly the same so gets boring after a while....paid full price for this game must have been stupid that day
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	I just got this game for 10$ lol. Hopefully it's good.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	Im only lv 17 or so and This game is fun IF HEALERS COULD HEAL NOT TANK OR DPS A DUNGEON 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/06/09/the-elder-scrolls-online-tamriel-unlimited-review	I love this game. I played Oblivion and Skyrim, its the perfect prequal. It is very similar to other MMORPG's such as Everquest, Ultima Online, or World of Warcarft. There are a few things that are irritating though. In order to access all of the world, you either have to purchase the additional expansion via 'crowns' or pay a monthy membership which gives you crowns. While you get 1,500 crowns monthly its much cheaper to speand the extra $40 and just get both expansions, which gets pricy considering that you not only pay for you console multiplayer access but the game!!! Pretty much everything else that is in game can be found in the game. If you find yourself totally lost, feel free to look up the guild Vera Causa. Lots of us can help!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	I'm watching the credits for the Executioner now...this score is too low. 8.0 for me
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	I've bought this game because of Mikami, and bought all the DLCs. I prefer RE because I don't like weird horror games with hallucinations and things like that. The DLCs are bad, and the worst is The Executioner in which you only fight bosses.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	The Evil Within is my favorite horror game of the past ten years. The concept alone was enough to make me go nuts for it. I'll never understand all the hate for this game. My two other horror favorites are Condemned: Criminal Origins and Scratches - I don't discriminate between survival horror or action horror or atmospheric horror or what have you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	Can someone who's played elaborate on what the hell repetitive gameplay means? Is it too similar to the main game? I've never heard DLC being too repetitive.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	It's too repetitive because the only thing you do is fight bosses. 6 or 7 I think.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	Can you guys stop doing review commentary and go back to the actual short and sweet review videos? IMO the review commentary appears to be a lazy product since all you have to do is to chat while playing the game. I really missed all the awesome review videos
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/the-evil-within-the-executioner-review	This was a great game. I think it's just people had insane expectations and that's why they go hate on it like it's the worst game of the year. Same thing with Watch Dogs.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	Can't stand it when a game has burned in subtitles.  It ensures that I'll turn the game off and never play it again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	"It's free today. Here's the list.
The Walking Dead: Season 2, PS4
Magicka 2, PS4
Mass Effect 2, PS3
Beyond Good & Evil, PS3
Dragon Fin Soup, PS4, PS Vita (PS3 Cross-Buy when available)
Invizimals, PS Vita"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	Suspect this and Walking Dead Season 2 are going to be the Plus games for November.  Hoping so for Walking Dead, I've played it but it's the only good Telltale game that I don't already own on PS4.  Shame it didn't get a Platinum trophy though.  Hope this'll be good too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	@Cherrywood Woah.  How did you predict this???
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	"@sirkrawly  ;-)  I'm connected.  My brother works at Sony and people talk.

Nah, I'm just kidding.  I went looking online last night to see if it had been leaked or announced (been thinking about buying Wasteland 2 and just wanted to make sure).  Apparently sometime late yesterday it seemed like the Dutch psn twitter account had posted the plus games image, which showed the PS4 games, and it was up for a little bit before they took it down.  Somebody got a screen grab.  Kinda thing that could have been fake but maybe wasn't.  Excited that it turned out true.  Season 1, Wolf among Us, Game of Thrones, Borderlands, already had all of them and you need at least an episode of 2 for the upcoming Michonne episodes.  And this game looks kinda cool too."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	"@Cherrywood ""Good"" Telltale game?  I wish they'd just skip to the punch and take all the controller input out of the game and make it a full blown movie.  At least we got a GOOD adventure game last month.  These Telltale games are a joke.

I'm fairly excited about Magicka, though."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	"@hobo.brigade @Cherrywood I mostly like the Telltale games.  I agree that they are hit or miss, and when they miss they're almost unplayable imo (ex, I bought the GoT season pass, and couldn't get past episode 3, so that felt like a nice waste of money)...  Either way, if you want to just watch them, I could almost guarantee you could find a youtube or a twitch stream of just the whole game straight through.

I still just want to know how @Cherrywood knew these were gonna be the games.... I smell a rat ;)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	"@sirkrawly @hobo.brigade  lol  I should have just said ""I'm connected"" and left it at that.

Personally, I think they've been on a roll since Walking Dead.  Favorite has been Wolf Among Us.

Fabletown is afraid of the Big Bad Wolf."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	@sirkrawly @hobo.brigade @Cherrywood See, that's the thing though.  I would much rather watch a playthrough.  The fact that I actually have to hold the controller, move characters around, and press a button pisses me off, because there's no puzzles or anything.  It's just walking around and pressing buttons.  I just wish they'd evolve beyond this and do true adventure games.  Lord knows, Kings Quest knocked it out of the park.  They bested Telltale's best story and had the gameplay to back it up.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	@Cherrywood @sirkrawly @hobo.brigade Again, I like the stories, I just want gameplay, too.  Kings Quest did it and succeeded on both accounts (story and gameplay).  Doublefine/Tim Schafer pulls it off everytime.  Yet for some reason everyone let's Telltale get away with a subpar product.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	"@Cherrywood @sirkrawly @hobo.brigade Lol for sure.  Well played sir.

I totally agree with you for the most part.  I love both seasons of WD, and I actually kind of think Wolf Among Us might be my favorite too...  Just was kind of let down by the GoT one.  All good though, not everything can be for everyone.  Still looking forward to see what they put out next."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	@Cherrywood @sirkrawly @hobo.brigade Wolf among us is the best for sure.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	I can't believe you played this single player. Other sites state don't bother !
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	The elite will definitely cover for some awkward button combinations... I still highly doubt it'll be released on console... I would LOVE to be proved wrong though. I love these games ^_^
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	Both controllers seems to have the same amount of buttons. Yet this deficiency will be over come with the upcoming elite controller.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	"I've watched the Yogscast crew tear it up on this game on youtube, and they were all having a blast.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	guess I'll give this a pass and just wait for elder scrolls instead
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	Yeah, because clearly your choices in entertainment are between Magicka 2 and The Elder Scrolls.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	Playing alone is pretty damn hard, but co-op is insane and unpredictable. Definitely give this game a try if you enjoy these types of Indies.. a solid 8.5 for me
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/magicka-2-review	The solo difficulty does seem increased compared to the original
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/destiny-house-of-wolves-review-2	Wait? Ppl still play Destiny!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/destiny-house-of-wolves-review-2	Only people who really enjoy the pvp apparently, cuz there is certainly no reason to bother with anything else, that's for sure.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/destiny-house-of-wolves-review-2	This game is the biggest hype driven piece of crap ever,it could have been so good. Unfortunately this is where games are headed,for $60 you get a half done game and you can get the rest in DLC for another $60. I'd have no problem paying more games if they were good and if we could get reviews pre-release.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/destiny-house-of-wolves-review-2	try Prison of Elders 35... it's just as tough as Raid
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/destiny-house-of-wolves-review-2	"That's what i keep saying! Destiny is held to some mythical high standard.... so many comments to the effect of ""Well, I played for 250 hours.... so believe me when i say it sucks."" That, and people saying there is not enough content.... which means they want more Destiny. I NEVER buy new or pay more than maybe $15 on a game. I'm up to $100 on Destiny, including DLC, and I've gotten very good value considering I'm likely at about $0.33 per hour played. Not quite New Vegas' $0.05 per hour.... but quite good regardless..... ESPECIALLY considering New Vegas is much more heavily RPG than Destiny."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/28/destiny-house-of-wolves-review-2	The anti Destiny are VERY vocal, giving the impression it's dead. This is not the case, just an example of a relatively small group making so much noise that observers would assume them the majority.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	"Hey everybody,
We're trying something out here as an experiment. Normally, when we write a review and score a game, that's more or less set in stone. But today, Jose has updated his Splatoon review and score to reflect what he sees as major, game-changing updates to the experience you get when you buy this game. It's something we'd like to do here and there when games we feel strongly about improve or degrade over time due to major updates or changes.

Here's more on how we handle re-reviews: http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/13/igns-re-review-policy"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	Voice chat is Cancer. Kids today are total AHOLES
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@cerenzio  Try playing destiny without it...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@cerenzio  You're goddamn right.  It's the worst, but now everyone complains when you don't use it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	Jose, I really don't get it with you. Not much of Nintendo has voice chat. Do you really want a game that has children being bullied and trolled from other adults? Let's be honest, your NOT a very good reviewer!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	Uh lets see. The only reason why ign gave Splatoon v2 gave the game a 8.6 is because there is no voice chat..... really ign? Actually, reallyJose.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	Just got a Wii U for my bday the 17th. Are people still playing Splatoon? Is it worth getting now so late in the game or should I be looking at other titles? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Grimes5117 A lot of people are still playing it. It's still worth it, voice chat or no. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@crowned_a_queen @Grimes5117 I could care less about voice chat. Glad people are still playing, that means I can start playing!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Grimes5117 Actually, it's a really good game! It's just that the reviewer wants little children to be mistreated, including young teenagers...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	In my opinion, the lack of voice chat makes the game better.  I don't like being insulted by random people in a game.  If I want that, I can just post my opinion online.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	Come on, Splatoon don't need VOICE CHAT.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	Explain to me why Splatoon get's an updated re-review but that shit review of Alien Isolation does not? Oh wait I forgot... because It's a Nintendo and no game site Is biased to Nintendo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Arumat my god different people he probably didn't even play alien isolation
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@kidlickurmom420blaze @Arumat That's my point. Splatoon can get re-reviewed by someone different but Alien Isolation or any other game can't? Isolation needs a new review by someone who actually plays the game Instead of rage quits 2 hours In.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Arumat @kidlickurmom420blaze how do you know he raged quit in two hours
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@kidlickurmom420blaze @Arumat Go read his review. He flat out said he quit playing around 4 hours In.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Arumat @kidlickurmom420blaze sorry man guess i missed it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@kidlickurmom420blaze @Arumat No biggie, It's just a crap review honestly, the way he wrote It made him sound like a whiny bitch, that the game was to hard for him so he rage quit and gave the game a 5. If you look at every other score It's all 8s and higher.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	"@Arumat @kidlickurmom420blaze Hey man -- don't misrepresent the contents of the review this way. He didn't quit four hours in. He explicitly stated in the opening that he spent 20 hours -- right in the opening paragraph. He finished the game before reviewing it (on Hard). 

But I wanted to address your original comment: why did Splatoon get a re-review. Re-reviews aren't done to give a different opinion on the same game. They're done to re-evaluate a game that has changed over time. Splatoon launched with a limited number of maps and features -- more were added over time. Thus, the game on launch day was different than what it is now. Hence: a good game to do a re-review. Alien Isolation hasn't changed -- you're disagreeing with the score, and that's fine. Everyone has their own opinion. But the reviewer's opinion hasn't changed and the game thus doesn't warrant another take. We've discussed the game in other media, though, including our podcasts -- thus, if you want other opinions, you can find them, too. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	A little less than a year since I boycotted IGN for being out of touch with my type of player and catering to the vocal minority. Haven't regretted it~
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	this game sucks, evertime i join a game two minutes later i have a connection problem and it logs me out, i have has the game for a week and am still leval one because i can finish a match
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Nictony2000 Definitely not the game's fault. Have not had a connection problem once. You are throwing shade when you should definitely be throwing money at your internet connection.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Grovfu @Nictony2000 I agree. I've had this game since the weekend of Thanksgiving, and have yet to be kicked out of a game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@Nictony2000 It might be because a lot Of Japanese players play.  It's hard for the servers to keep up with eight people from all over the world.  Try playing during the day to minimize that kind of problem
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	no voice chat? so this game is pretty much a great game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@alpha_male If that is the only thing wrong with it and can be easily fixed with Skype or any other voice chat app. don't you think that a 9.0 is what the score should be?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/27/splatoon-review	@PAC-Man0607 @alpha_male I agree. I thought about wanting voice chat in this game, but I enjoy playing and having to take a few seconds to figure out what my team will do in the random battles. The ones that charge to the front, the ones that only want to kill, the ones that stay back and paint; it is cool figuring that out instead of everyone just telling me. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	That episode ending was intense. The game could have technically ended there.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	Dark Room review? Terrible review. It was a really great episode.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	I really like it but, no, it doesn't have a chance, at least certainly not here. This and, depending on the quality, Until Dawn should be the surprises of the year though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	"I thought it was pretty obvious that they would have to take it back.
The interesting question is will they take back what happens at the end of episode 4."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	Haven't played episode 4 yet, no spoilers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	Just finished episode 4. Holy shit don't you dare not give us a happy end!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	reading this review today makes your comment funny
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	Nope. Didnt take it either.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	you don't know that though. No one does.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	Man out of all the three episode this is by far the best one. That ending was great and it made me a bit annoyed that episode 4 isn't out yet. Although I get where the narrative wants to go with having changed the past and thus the future, I would have liked to have been given the choice of changing it or leaving it be kind of like Chrono Trigger and the side-event of helping Lucca's mom. I think that's the only irk I have with this episode and it's not even all that bothersome.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/19/life-is-strange-episode-3-review	Only a few more days before episode 4 comes out! Argh this has been really painful so far.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	"This was my first game i got with my xbox 1 and a half year ago.  Now, replaying it. I still think it's well worth the hype. It's vibrant, beautifull, the story is great, the characters looks and feel awesome.  It's not perfect no.  the menu can be a bit time consuming on lore sometimes.  And some quest marks are just for the real grinders. And maybe the biggest city has a little lag so now and then, some foliage could be better on console, but ey, it's so massive that you forgive them for that..,  And you cannot kill everyone :p/. haha,  but no,  It's just a game that feels so much alive. ,
Im getting 40 this month and played games since i was a kid.  this is deffinitly a keeper. just the sheer beauty of some of the envirements are enough to come back to this..   "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	Great game. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	"The best game I've ever played. I'm on my fifth play through now and yesterday picked up a quest I'd never done before in Novigrad.
CDPR really showed everyone else how to make a single player RPG. The depth to the combat style (although wish the boss fights could have had more variety with how to kill them a la Dark Souls), the incredible graphics, the amazing, thoughtful choices in the dialogue wheel, the fantastic stories (some of the side stories can leave a lasting impression (e.g. woman who loves her werewolf  brother-in-law)), the random scenes around the world where there isn't even a quest, but you just have to figure out what's happened by looking at the clues around you (or there probably is a quest and I just haven't found it...) and best of all, the rich, appealing characters. I genuinely fell in love with this world.
Apparently, it took up to 250 staff three and a half years to make this game, plus over a thousand extra people to support. That's insane. But kudos to them because I've never played anything as good as it. And I say that having spent 7 years on Wow, countless replays of the Half-Life series, and God knows how many plays of Uncharted 2.

People that say the game is boring and repetitive... Most of that seems to come from people that can't be bothered to read the books/quest info/glossaries. It's tedious to do in most games, but in this... there are so many great stories. Everything is so well thought out."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	"This game is lame! 

Everyone says beautiful things of this boring game, don't waste your money! 

Why? The story is very repetitive, It's always the same but different cities and characters... looking for your daughter on the big world, going to diferent places, talking with diferent people, and always you do the same! (go and kill that monster/enemy, defend my people, 3 hours of boring speech and the mission is over) 

5/10 "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	@Birdpersona you literally could not be more wrong.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	Honestly the best game I have ever played.  I'm actually a COD player but this RPG made me spend hours and hours playing.  I finished the main story and both DLC s.  The game has a fantastic story line and you never know what to expect. I loved that you can customize Geralts armor, weapons and skills.  10/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	Honestly telling i never played before any game like WITCHER 3 (including 2 dlc), Video games are a very important part of my life, i play a lot of action rpg games and this was the best game i have ever played among all games. Story, game play, combat, scenario, main quests, side quests, characters, i can't find even 1 negative point in this game. Congratulations CD PROJEKT RED for this unique and epic experience. Ending was very sad for me, and it changes according to your choices. I was very upset when it finished. But the expansions were as great as the main game. I don't think i will see a better game in years, may be live in my imagination over centuries. 10 out of 10.   
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	What did you play it on? PC or console?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	@Fastguy77 PC, my friend.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	 More proof that PC > PS4 > XBone
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	Best game with the best dlc's
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	@Isufbycmeti1 Skyrim > W3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	"@Tom_Clancy87 @Isufbycmeti1

Actually, I would probably say Skyrim is around equal to W3 in most ways, considering the times both were made, however, we should probably remember that this is our opinions, and we should therefore not be speaking as if they are fact."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	@Tom_Clancy87 @Isufbycmeti1 you have got to be mentally ill if you think Skyrim is anywhere near the same league as W3.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	"Great game that takes some time and effort to really enjoy what's unfolding in front of you. The story line reminds me of Game of Thrones, mixed in with a little Lord of the Rings.  The different land areas are really something to behold.  You have to invest in the game, which I'm sure will be difficult to do if you ""have a life"".  I almost quit in the beginning but the story keeps getting more engrossing.  You really have to do your homework by cheats and stuff to get the full use of the game.  But it's the story that really propels this one.  If you have 80 hours and want to experience a great story this is the one.  I'm not a final fantasy guy, but I'd assume this is similar but with more hands on action.  "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	"The writer of this article gives the game a high score, but some of opinions fall flat. Your observations about the story are rather pitiful, and it sounds like someone who cannot grasp a good plot.
Campaigns that rush through stories leave much to be desired. Apparently this guy is both unfamiliar with the saga as a whole and has a short attention span."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/the-witcher-3-the-wild-hunt-review	@Burratus game isnt a masterpiece. i tried getting into it twice, just not my taste. i prefer SKYRIM way more tbh 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	FFX is #1 in the gaming history :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	"Not as good as FFX... Sadly.
But still enjoyable"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	And one more addendum- In my opinion- This isn't the best Final Fantasy but is right up their among the elite and best of the best. #1. FF7 (without a doubt) #2. FF12 or FF9- Its an extremely close battle between these 2 and were both equally epic in my eyes. #3. FFX- Sadly, FFX (with the exception of FF12) is where Square did a 360 degree turnaround with the FF series and has since lost me. Lets hope FFXV will win us loyal fans back over!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	@Crookedjbo89 A month and a half later...We're on the same page with the top 3 but FFX was the beginning of the linear FF with little to no side content.  I curse you FFX.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	I thought this Remaster was a huge upgrade to the original PS2 version (which is the only version prior to this I had played) and was a welcome walk down memory lane into one of FF's more touching titles. FFX has always had this depressing effect on me but it an ok way, it is just the amazing music blending in with the lovable characters and the feeling that something bad is going to happen to one of your beloved heroes.... Its a powerful feeling. The music is without a doubt top notch and manages to capture the moments both happy and sad (especially sad) and really make players feel the drama. FFX was also the 1st FF to have character dialogue and is looked upon by most as a milestone in FF history. And it surprised me just how attached I could get on my 2nd play through. It brought me back years so long ago, when I was playing FFX on my PS2 when life was easy and carefree!! FFX-2 is an awesome game in its own right but doesn't hold a light to FFX as X-2 comes off as a far less serious and playful version of FFX. There is literally SO much content in between FFX & FFX-2 and its all on one disc now, INCLUDING a brand new soundtrack that you have the option of hearing while you play with never before seen DLC (trailers) and the content is surprisingly good. To be so little of it, it is very informative and answered some of the questions I had before. It is such a great deal for this HD Remaster for $40.00 or however much you end up paying, its well worth it. There is over 100 hours of content in between the 2 (actually if your like me well more than that) but I recommend this to anyone who likes Final Fantasy of course, but also to fans who have played the older version. The graphic enhncements are stunning and are easily noted. Also, ANY fan of RPG who doesn't own this should get it now. Beautful story, amazing music, heartfelt characters & a sad life of the people of Spira. Its well worth it!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	I just bought the Final Fantasy X and X HD for my Playstation 3 from Walmart. Never played Final Fantasy X before but i have heard good things over the years. Plus voice acting for a Final Fantasy game was a huge deal back then too
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	Hows X-2? FFX was one of my favorite games of all time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	So, no the PC version was actually horse shit. I'm sorry, there wasn't a huge difference which is why nobody was excited at all. Did you watch the video of them announcing that trash? Yeah, no excitement, however, turns out they are doing a real remake. So you can finally be excited, even if they change the story. WOOOO!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	FFXIII-2 was better than this. imo
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	@bmagicdabeast  Never
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	I honestly don't get why people hated it so much. Once you got the hang of it, got the various passes and shots, and get to make your own team, it really shines. When I found there was a Ject shot two. I nearly lost my 12 year old mind lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	Agreed. Just finished my first reread. Want to do it again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/12/final-fantasy-x-x-2-hd-remaster-ps4-review	I'm just about to restart it but ploughing through the Witcher series at the moment. Highly recommend it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	I hate when im reading a review and the reviewer is like i encountered a part w challenge that i almost beat but died/lost and had to restart. Yep its a game. Thats whats supposed to happen. Did this game lose review points bc of that fact? Is what im always left wondering. Why mention it? You also pressed many buttons while playing but did not feel need to gripe or mention?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	I feel that 7.0 is too low for this game when there are other generic FPS games available that receive a higher score. Although some parts throughout The Old Blood's campaign feel repetitive, the polished mechanics and various enemy types keep things refreshing. Also, the environment is constantly changing from unique place to unique place which I feel the developer deserves praise for as many games nowadays aren't as creative with the setting. This should have easily gotten an 8/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	On steam sale right now 75% off. Just played through the New Order and enjoyed it for the most part.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	"It's unreasonable to have player pick health and armor fillers automatically since they can be overcharged. If it happens so, you could easily, accidentally, ""automatically"" pick 'em up even if you don't want to just by walking pass it. That's a waste of limited resources."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	Is it worth the price to get both Wolfenstein games? I'm thinking about getting them, it will cost $50 Are they worth $50?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	If you liked the game, read my review of 'Wolfenstein: The Old Blood' here: https://gamebio.wordpress.com
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	I thought this was a much better game than New Order, personally. Felt more Wolfenstein-ey if anything else.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/08/wolfenstein-the-old-blood-review	"So I JUST finished it. Wow...

It got dark VERY FAST. Its even darker than The New Order.

What a short prequel story. God damn... and $20 only!

Usually prequel stories in games as expansions rarely work if played before the original, but I feel like if you play this before the original, it would work perfectly!

I do hope they keep making more and more to expand the story. Ever since Return of Castle Wolfenstein (which this felt like a spiritual remake), I have loved this franchise dearly.

For me, its a 8.5/10"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/06/project-cars-review	This game is awesome with Oculus Rift CV1. Tried iRacing, dont understand the hype with that one. Assetto Corsa is also good in VR. Currently wasting my time writing comments until i finish work and can go home and plug myself into PCars again.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/06/project-cars-review	Im thinking of getting a PS4 just for this game, looks amazing and seems control better then GT. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/06/project-cars-review	"I am not sure who allowed Luke Reilly to start reviewing games, but his opinion of this game is terrible. I LOVE RACING GAMES! Dirt 2 is still hands down one of the best racing games. I even love playing NASCAR games because of my shear love for racing games. Now you know my background.
The graphics in this game have yet to be beat, but once you get past that, the racing itself is Okay at best. The tacks are great, the vast car selection is 2nd to none. But the driving mechanics... or lack there of completely ruin this game. The whole idea behind the career mode is the best I have seen in any game. But yet again, I can not get myself past the terrible driving mechanics.
I am just waiting for MXGP2 to come out. I hate watching motorcross, but I just have a soft spot for racing games."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/05/06/project-cars-review	@RedSunRising it's really good, they've done a good job patching it, think it's on v5 now. I use a pc and an xone controlller (i know, i know no wheel) and it is hard yet rewarding and completely playable.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/23/the-evil-within-the-consequence-review	This to me is a pretty good example of a good DLC adds a little extra to the game and I found the story pretty interesting.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/23/the-evil-within-the-consequence-review	I am all for DLC as it can substantial add to the time spent playing games you really enjoy. that being said, the developers really need to up their game when it comes to DLC. the vast majority of DLC I have played over the last year has been mediocre at best and have scored as such which most reviewers. the only one that really sticks out as being awesome was Storm Island for Forza. they need to do better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/23/the-evil-within-the-consequence-review	I absolutely loved The Evil Within, which is weird because I don't normally play horror games. Ended up playing through it 7 times to get all the achievements!! last playthrough being on akumu mode. Looking forward to playing the DLC. I don't have xbox live, so I'm just gonna hope they make an all-inclusive disk soon :D

What pisses me off about the game is that fact that the save is automatic instead of player save. You die, you do not  have a chance to do it again.  You have to start all over if you want that character and it is so hard  even when you have high experience points in all groups.   I.E.  leadership, fighting, wits, etc.   To go out alone, it is hard to get anywhere and is just as hard with someone watching your back.  It is really a game that shows you, you are in a no win situation.   The game- a 9.   The sytem setup and operation- a 3 or less.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	We need more games like this. Actually I should say developers like this. People that aren't afraid to try new ideas. Large developers play it very safe and that's why the industry is full of cookie cutter FP shooters.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	1440P isnt too expensive and its noticeably better picture.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	I hate that the game keeps going after you quit. I had 2 highly leveled people that I switched between. One got captured and my dinner was done cooking so I logged off and ate. Logged back on an hour later and she was dead. How is that fair?? Also, this was a ridiculously high leveled person that could kill a zombie building if that was a thing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	Yeah that was the only problem I had with this. It takes a special disposition to roll with this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	@ganster-master if your character was safe at base, with plenty of surrounding outposts connecting to keep away hordes this wont happen. Ever.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	i'd give it a 7. being able to create your own character would have brought it to 8. a 7 because the frame rate and controls are still extremely unstable at times, sometimes the worst times. a good game to buy though, fun most of the time and keeps you locked in if you get past the FR and control issues.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	They badly need MP on this game. It'd be an amazing co-op.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	It is crazy that they couldn't implement this on new hardware a year down the line.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/22/state-of-decay-year-one-survival-edition-review	I don't really get why they made even remastered this when it still looks the same.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/assassins-creed-chronicles-china-review	I liked this game was fun to play. Final boss why not need fight him face to face? Alert him and try kill by fight not stealth kill more fun...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/assassins-creed-chronicles-china-review	AC Chronicles is based off of AC2 Discovery. If AC Chronicles really is a rip off of Mark of the Ninja, then Mark of the Ninja would be a rip off of Prince of Persia and AC2 Discovery.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/21/assassins-creed-chronicles-china-review	They must be fans of mark of the ninja. Because it's a big rip from it. Witch is a good thing that was a great game. This one is not bad worth 5 bucks if you are a gold member on xbox.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/13/mortal-kombat-x-review	"This is an old post that I'm responding to. I get that. But anyways...
OrangeCrush specifically said they weren't in favor of censorship, only that gratuitous violence like seen here gives games a bad name. You're suggesting a solution to an extreme they never proposed in the first place. And to accept a medium as an artform isn't to give every entry into the medium a free pass as genuine art.
For example, a person could argue that a snuff film has as much right to exist artistically as any art house flick that explores really dark places in the human psyche. Technically, that's true. In practice however, one explores the underlying issues while the other offers no commentary, only shock value (but without the redeeming values true artists implant in shocking imagery). Yeah, they both have a right to exist. But, as OrangeCrush already stated, one gives the medium a bad name because it exploits the bad with no exploration of what it means. Should it be censored? Maybe, maybe not. Should it be called out for what it is? I think the answer is still not definite, but it definitely seems like more of a yes to me."

You won't be seeing anything when Tekken 7 comes out cause it's going straight where Tekken 6 went: the bargain bin 2 weeks after release.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/rbi-baseball-15-review	I like the game overall, and many of the features are vast improvements over the original. However, my one criticism is that every outfielder has an absolute howitzer for an arm. A sac fly to deep center or a single to right should always score a run. Not with this group of outfielders. Every one is Roberto Freakin' Clemente (or Yeonis Specedes or you youngsters).

- one of the worst mmorpg character customization ever .
- laggy ,frame rates drops .

In short, bad game and not worth trying , lets hope for black desert and blade and soul release on console."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/neverwinter-xbox-one-review	You can't do anything without paying
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/neverwinter-xbox-one-review	Technically, you can, BUT many people don't factor in the controller AND the fact that the same PC will have to be upgraded the following year, max the one after, to keep up. So, unless you game a lot (purchase lots of games I mean) console is cheapest.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/neverwinter-xbox-one-review	Yes and no. If you don't care for console exclusives and purchase many games a year, you'll probably end up paying less in the long term on pc. Or break even, but *usually* have the best version of the game. That said, console gaming is the way to go for most people, myself included.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/04/08/neverwinter-xbox-one-review	the one review i agree with. the frame rate drops are so bad that the game freezes and cause you to die in most situations. and not to mention the horrible communication.

Entitled - believing oneself to be inherently deserving of privileges or special treatment.


Just because the DLC was free, people were using that as the reason for why it should have got a higher score. Hence the reason why I said that they were being entitled. Based upon the comments, every free game should get higher than a 6.5 which is not the case at all."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	"I give this game nothing less than a 9.5.
It is essentially the best 2D Metroid game ever made. Yes, that includes Super Metroid after you take off your rose-tinted glasses.
It's also the first game I've played in 4-5 years where I immediately replayed it after beating it the first time.
In hindsight, the $20 price tag looks like a steal because I would have easily paid double that for the enjoyment I got out of it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	@OsamaBinKilld I have to agree with you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	@OsamaBinKilld agree!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	"@OsamaBinKilld This game is not better than Super Metroid.. Not even close.. There is no ""rose tinted glasses"", it is just true. I have the game on my Wii-U, and can replay it any day. Its still better than any wanna be metroid game like this. This game felt very bland compared to Super Metroid. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	"@OsamaBinKilld rose-tinted glasses? Super metroid is one of the best games ever made maybe your the one that forgot to take his glasses off. They speed run super metroid 20 years later. Lets see where axiom verge is 20 years from now how many people still play and talk about it. 
Have you ever played super metroid? Maybe your confusing it for other games."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	"I disagree, especially on the Shadow Complex front.
We're ending up with a lot of games mimicking that already and they all feel exactly the same. Doesn't matter the developer or if they pull in the original cast.
Flashback, Blade Kitten, Strider, Shadow Complex, I'm sure there's others, they all feel very similar. The way the character moves, falls, controls.
Yes these call back games are weird to adopt a pixely style but they at least have a different feel, they actually have a different weight to them.
They apply a physics engine or something to them and they just feel identical while these games at least look different and feel like they should. Like a game aiming to be older and not floaty jump Mc Havok Engine."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	Exactly. I think the best counter-example is Ori and the Blind Forest. It's also a modern metroidvania game. But it feels really unique in the way it controls and has an absolutely gorgeous and jaw dropping art style.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	"Totally agree. It's not as if reviewers normally shy away from development details - who's handling the license, what did they make before, what's the budget, etc. - and for a ""love letter"" like this it's an odd oversight. My guess?Sliva just didn't know."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	I like throwback games, but I'm getting pretty tired of throwback graphics. Take a look at something like Dust: An Elysian Tale, Strider 2014, or Shadow Complex for how to do classic design with modern visuals.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	Good point. Super metroid is my favorite of the franchise, also like the older megaman X games, but there's no reason the art style should still be so similar, it wasn't like that's how they wanted those games to look, it was what they had to work with at the time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	I said the same thing as I played this game for the first time last night. I was really enjoying it and though, how cool would this game be with graphics from a game like Swapper, dark and gritty.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	That would be great. Someday maybe old 8-16 bit style nostalgia games will die out for the better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/30/axiom-verge-review	I like throwback games, but I'm getting pretty tired of throwback graphics. Take a look at something like Dust: An Elysian Tale, Strider 2014, or Shadow Complex for how to do classic design with modern visuals.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/26/dragon-age-inquisition-jaws-of-hakkon-review	"I see that your comment was a month ago, but maybe you still haven't decided. I was skeptical about spending 15 bucks on it too, but I did it last month and today I bought The Descent. Jaws of Hakkon was fun, but as the reviwer said, more of the same, I think The Descent is something different, reminder of Origins but with Inquisition's combat and style. It goes away from the whole ""this is a map, have fun"" thing and follows a more linear storyline, im having a lot of fun so far. I had fun with Jaws of Hakkon too, but if you have 15 bucks to spend, I´d do it on The Descent and leave Hakkon for the holiday discount :)"

I've been playing Origins after beating Inquisition and I really miss the combat from Inquisition. Should I pay the 10 bucks for this or wait and hope it even cheaper like 6 months later?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	I hope someone can help me, on ps4 does the game have 4 player local offline split screen mode where we play against each others me and my friends while we are together in the same room , I hope I made it clear

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	whats even better is, it gives ALL DLC, that's right, ALL of it, including the skin packs, and even the limited time skins like the luck of the zaford skins and lovapalooza skins (although not the community day skins unfortunately) 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	Playing through The Handsome Collection atm and I find it really difficult to get rare loot... Im over half way through the game and have reached level 20, and have yet to find a yellow colored weapen. Any tips?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	@Koala-Hero first of all there is not yellow colored weapons in borderlands unless ur talking about legendaries (orange) that you can find on certain enemies at a low chance of dropping so no, you won't find any legendary loot on ur level
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	After looking online for hours trying to find anything about the issue affecting all Xbox one players since release of this game I am yet to find anything so I am posting on all review sites instead warning Xbox One gamers that the matchmaking on the Handsome Collection does not work, always says no matches found. TO REPEAT AS NO ONE ELSE BUT THE GEARBOX/2K FORUMS MENTIONS THIS ISSUE, THE MATCHMAKING DOES NOT WORK ON XBOX ONE!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	Sucks that reviews like this that put a game down for having split screen co-op that isn't perfect is what developers get to use as an excuse to not include it at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/24/borderlands-the-handsome-collection-review	@cronovt +1. Even if you can't make it perfect, we still appreciate it! There are still plenty of us in the world who enjoy playing with friends in the same room.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	This game is a masterpiece!!Probably my favorite game of all-time.Love the graphics, the design.Level design is great.Boss fight are epic(some more than others).Couple that was boring(3 or 4).I am at ng+3 and can't stop playing it.I love how each weapons are unique with there move-set.Weapon transformation is awesome as well.As I said...Masterpiece
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	I've had this game since the first day out and since then I've tried to get into this game numerous of times... sometimes I would try to force myself to enjoy it. But It is just way too hard and time consuming. The thing that makes me want to try over and over is the gothic beauty of this game. One of my favorite games growing up was nightmare creatures 1 , this game reminds me of it....but I keep dying over and over and over ...to a point that it's a waste of real life... people master this game and they enjoy it, that's great... but I can't die 10+ times every other fight just to get so far. I'm going to put back on shelf ... to the makers of bloodborne please add an easy mode a (normal) mode... let everyone enjoy this game. Not all of us are fortunate enough to spend hours and hours and hours on a video game..... I like bloodbornes beauty... let me enjoy it..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	@LuisVillCruz This is exactly what keeps me away from it.  It looks amazing, but I dont have time to play hours and make little progress because of the difficulty.  I'm all for a challenge, but not looking for a grind.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	"Just bought this game and as of today I feel like it's one of the worst video games I ever played this Generation. I see the high praise, great reviews but the game just isn't any good to me.

Poor animations, graphics look dated, poor level design and ""The Grind"" + insane level of difficulty has just turned me away puzzled and need answers...........

By comparison I also fired up Horizon Zero Dawn fore the first time today and that game grabbed me right away and imo is phenomenal!!!

Picked up a PS4 PRO with Horizon Zero Dawn, Little Big Planet, Bloodborne and MLB SHOW 17 (Love old school retro mode).

Need to pick up Uncharted 4"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	it's modern castlevania
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	I bought this game at launch because I read somewhere that it was a more accessible DS game.  Having played Demon, DS and DS2, and not fairing well, I wanted to try it out.  Initially the game proved to be a bit too difficult, so I shelved it.  Fast forward two years when Nioh comes out, and after doing very well in that game I decide to dust off BB and give it another go, being that the combat felt very similar.  Now I'm two bosses away from the true ending, and have completed all of the depth 3 chalice dungeons.  How this game got a 9.1 and not a perfect score is amazing.  It's as close to a flawless game as it gets in my eyes.  Besides Nioh, it's the only game I can think of that I'll be playing well past NG.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	"@AbstractWonder Probably the fact that Blood Vials are non-refilling consumables, the load times, the frame rate (although fixed now), as well as some minor flaws.
I agree though. Great game. I'm currently playing through it too. I'm just past Ludwig in the Old Hunters DLC. Main game is right before the end. Loved it. 
If you liked it I recommend DS3"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	@SneakyDex @AbstractWonder Yeah, I saw The Fire Fades edition on sale and scooped it up.  I read somewhere that it is roughly the same as BB, difficulty wise.  That'll be next once I get through the DLC bosses and then close out the last two of the main story.  Plus I need to eventually kill Yharnam for the Plat trophy.  I played to the first boss in DS3 and I'm finding that parrying is a bit more difficult than BB.  I think I prefer the gun over a shield.  Can't wait to dive in further though.  That first boss is the quickest I've ever beat a boss in DS, only died once.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	@SneakyDex @AbstractWonder Also, Ludwig humbled me.  I was flying high after beating Mergo's Wet Nurse and went from her to DLC.  Died about 6 times to Ludwig before rage quitting and jumping back into Ailing Loran to farm some levels (where Blood-Starved Beast humbled me further). 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	199 thousand comments!!! What in the actual fuck? This game is a masterpiece and if it was ever released on PC I would die of happiness again. and again. and again. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	"Being a fan of the Souls series I naturally picked this game up a few months after it was out. At first grind I didn't like it and couldn't get used to the battle mechanics of the game i.e. pace, no shields, limited weapons and sorceries etc.
I pressed on and got frustrated with Martyr Logarius and by then Dark Souls 3 was coming out.
I ditched Bloodborne for DS3 which then that sucked over a year of my life---totally worth it---however now after playing DS3 and seeing the new weapon arts as well as reading up on some Bloodborne builds, I figured out what I was doing wrong reanalyzed my strategy and I fired up the game starting brand new.
Best decision ever not to give up on this masterpiece. Approaching it with a new perspective and a build that I can enjoy in the game and not feel like I'm painfully grinding away.
I think my fault before was that I was trying to play it exactly like a DS game and it's an entirely different beast (pun intended).
Additionally before I was going more for a strength/arcane build and stupid me I wasn't even using a strength based weapon (cane) but couldn't figure why I was hitting so weak when my stats were strength and arcane. I figured how the gems work and function better and what to place my efforts on. Overall this is a phenomenal game and deserves the praise it has."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	This game is so difficult yet so fair, because you're often your own undoing. The progress in discovery is so rewarding that although the game allows the player to turn back and use their Blood Echoes, it's often too tempting to get a step ahead and getting one more kill towards the next checkpoint. That often results in death and loss of progress but the satisfaction of getting it done is loke nothing else.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	PIcked this up for $7.99 PSN sale having never played a Souls game before. Great fun, challenging...reminds me of an old school game with modern graphics.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	Love this game, but god damn I suck. :D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	@DlRtYCaSh I hear ya man.  I died at least 30 times trying to beat the first wolf with my bare hands until I figured out I didn't need to.  I've probably died another 50 times since (mostly due to carelessness), and am just about to reach Father Gascoigne.  It'll probably take me a year to beat this game, but it's unlike anything I've ever played before.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/23/bloodborne-review	@JHCali @DlRtYCaSh  damn those 2 big werewolves at the start.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	I play this game with my girlfriend and her brother very often, we have a lot of fun, i really recommend it if you want to have a great time with friends, i believe playing vs cpu is not fun since you cannot make fun of them.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	You didn't really play. Did you?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	"Are. You. Fucking. Shitting. Me. 

This got a better rating than mario party 8? MP8 wasn't the best in the series no doubt, or even an improvement in anysense. But 10! 10 Doesn't deserve mindlessly bashing, but it also doesn't deserve a score better than 8. What the fuck IGN."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	I don't understand why they didn't bring online multiplayer.  Would be 10x more fun than playing with cpu.  Of course you can play with real friend, but it's less convenient as you can't play whenever you want...  That should've been a con, in 2016 I can't believe they made a 'party' game for offline only...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	Then congrats on being confusing, probably deliberately. Thumbs up lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	Confused? No. Mario party 10 just wasn't a good game. And that's coming from a long time fan of the series, but whatever
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	Agree to disagree.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	You don't even have to tap the amiibo on the Gamepad every time; you can just hit the A button on the Gamepad instead.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	My feelings exactly.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/17/mario-party-10-review	"""Dissappointed my SSB amiibo's will have their data deleted if I choose to use them with MP10.""

Not true. Using my Rosalina with Smash data, I could still select the Rosalina board at the start of the game, and I could still collect and use tokens during. The only things I could not do were customize the base of the amiibo (the bases you collect are saved to the amiibo), and select a token to start the game with (found tokens behave the same way as found bases).

It's better to play with an amiibo with no Smash data, since some of the tokens you find (and are saved) allow you to use different boards without having that board's amiibo, but you definitely don't have to delete your Smash data if you don't want to. :)"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	 One of the worst games I've ever played in my life.  Is this really the state of AAA gaming nowadays?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	"Amazing how all the reviews for most games on sites like this say the same thing.....good, great....blah.

This is anything but good. Its a pavolv's dogs style of game where you have do things in a sequence to get a reward or suffer getting stuck said  ""sequence"". Worse still its often as clear as mud what you are supposed to do to get said reward. So you often find you are stuck trying to resolve something trivial like small piece of evidence and until you do you can not move the game along.

No real freedom to play the game your way at all. Indeed I'd go so far as to say you don't play the game the game plays you.

Small wonder this pickled turd of a game is in the bargain basement section on EA."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	Very probably going to pick this up this week on PSN, as it's hard to argue with a $3.99 price point.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	I did the same last week and just played through the first chapter tonight. Even if I never touch it again it's worth 3.99. That said, this is a damn good game. Much better than what I thought it'd be.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	PSN having sales of this at only USD3.99 this week!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	The game is only $4.50 on Games with Gold right now
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	its a fun battlefield game however it is not worth the money you pay for it. its also the most sloppy-made battlefield game ive seen them come out with. most modes are unplayable since most maps are just re-sized and re-used

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/16/battlefield-hardline-review	The reason I hated Hardline was because it was a carbon copy of battlefield  4.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	I consider myself to be one of the harshest game crititcs out there and I give this game a 10/10. Typically this type of game will have you just find your favorite weapon and setup. Then you stick with that for the rest of the game.     This is where Helldivers is truely a masterpiece.   A favorite setup might be really good against one type of enemy.   You can one shot those aliens no problem at all!   Then you go to a different planet where the aliens have shields.   All of the sudden that rocket 1 shot now requires 2 shots.   One shot to get rid of the shield.    This is one of the many examples of how you have to adapt to your enemies.    One amazing setup might not work against something else, which forces you to adapt.   There is also TONS of different equipment to choose from..... The developers really thought this game out and it really shows.    I only have given 2 other games 10/10 ratings so this should really show how impressed I am.    This game can be played by yourself, but this game isn't experienced in it's fullest unless you have some other people to play with!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	I enjoy the game but the servers keep crashing. So you will be in the middle of the game an it losses connection and kicks you out...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	"yep got this on ps plus, im lucky enough to own a xbox one aswell and although the freebies on xbox always tick better quality boxes sony nailed it this month with this game its a gem.
at first i thought what most of us probably thought, that being its just a generic shooter with fairly poor graphics, typical freebie indy stuff but i gave it an hour to win me over. once you start laying down tactical weaponry and figuring out numerous ways to protect or accomplish your mission its becomes a thrill. then my 4 year old son picked up a pad and jumped right in by my side protecting my backside and occasionally shooting me down in the excitement of war and it was hilarious, thrilling and we high fived like a real team at the end of a mission. although its not for children its nothing to graphic and it is too complicated to play tactically for younger players so while the kid has my back ill lay down the backup weaponry etc and its still a riot to play.
i remember playing streets of rage etc with my father and i have a feeling this game will be remembered by my son as he gets older and thats the real test for a co op adventure with family and friends.
great game!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	@jinx20001 Spent a good chunk of yesterday playing this with my son on PS3. Best PS+ game in months. Reminds me of playing Chaos Engine on the Amiga with my brother. Not since Baldur's Gate Dark Alliance have I seen such a solid co-op game. I even went for the DLC pack which is on offer on PS+, for the extra weapons etc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	All I can say is wow.  got this off ps+ and can't put it down.  love the friendly fire and all the randoms deaths 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	Accidentally downloaded this from PS+ yesterday, so decided to try it today. I have zero regrets. It's awesome and I'm having a lot of fun with it. Online's cool because everyone really works together. Friends are easily made, haha.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	I can hardly wait to play this as a free PS+ game! Nice!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	would this be fun as a single player game though?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	@clockers2014 He pretty much covers that in the review...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	@clockers2014 While you can play on your own, missions get tough pretty quickly. You really do need to play with others to see most of the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	So I got Gauntlet for free on PS plus and then I was immediately sold on this game, well played arrow head...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	I freaking love this game. Animations, mechanics and actual action is pretty fun. I enjoy this with my wife even on controller which is rare in my case. Deserved 9 this time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/13/helldivers-review	Just bought this for couch co op with my bro . It's great !!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	Exactly!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	Kirby & the Rainbow Curse was another top quality Nintendo game. It really surprised me, exceeded my expectations.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	It was a lot of fun, specially that tank level and the final boss.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	You must now have played Mario Kart 8, Bayonetta 2, Super Smash Bros, and Hyrule Warriors.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	Own them all; Bayonetta 2 was the only one that felt worth owning.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	Sounds like you have the wrong console. I enjoyed the heck out of a bunch of releases including Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/12/mario-vs-donkey-kong-tipping-stars-review	Wow, I am a bit surprised because Kirby & the Rainbow Curse was very enjoyable and the boss battles were a lot of fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/11/the-evil-within-the-assignment-review	I was like 3 mins into this review waiting for the review, and just stopped. I like when they stick to the usual format of reviews, not two people rambling on.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/11/the-evil-within-the-assignment-review	Great piece of DLC, and IMO the best one of the 3 offerings. Awesome review Lucy!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/11/the-evil-within-the-assignment-review	I said the same thing.Surprised about the longevity of this title&the Dlc makes it evn better*Really good game.Can't wait for Pt2 lol

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/11/the-evil-within-the-assignment-review	Yes,give it a chance it goes back&forth alot*I felt the same as you at 1st also.....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	white night = resident evil/dark souls noir
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	Strange to say, but I think this game might have looked better at 30 FPS. The high framerate is kind of jarring.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	I used to use the term nonchalantly in my immature days, couldn't see why anyone would be offended by the term if I wasn't even using it in that context? then my best friend came out as gay, it made me rethink my outlook and I realised that using a sexual preference in a derogatory way or to put someone down is offensive, it basically just equates to gay=bad, it may be the informal meaning listed in the dictionary, but it doesn't make it right to use. Just my opinion keep on trucking people
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	Creepy ghosts is a pro? Ill keep that in mind
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	I found really cool 100% walkthrough on YouTube:
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	I found a really cool 100% walkthrough of White Night on YouTube.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	I'm really enjoying this game. It does remind me in a lot of ways of the original resident evil. (which is a good thing imo)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	Beautiful game. Shame it ended up being mediocre.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	I don't think saying the game has insta-death is entirely fair. You either out of the area, or fry them with a light. I know in a panic it's easy to get turned around and get caught, but it is perfectly possible to get away. Annoying, but far from insta-death. My only real complaint with the game is the writing - it fits the noir pulp style but a lot of it is awkwardly translated from (I'm assuming) French to English and sometimes it just sounds / reads wrong.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/white-night-review	I like it but I can understand why other people may not like it. I showed it to my boyfriend and he didn't look interested in it. He doesn't like the thought of searching every nook and cranny. But I think the atmosphere, the music, the graphics are great. The mechanics are cool and when I do beat the game, I want to replay and record my play through of the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	I bought the definitive edition last week and beat it yesterday.  Then I realized my save was locked... because the definitive edition comes with a digital copy of the original and I had been playing that the whole time.  Ugh.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	Great game. Pro tip, get the definitive edition because it really is the better version. It has teleporting, allows exploration past the end credits, improved frame rate, and some new abilities if you can find them
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	@catcher555 Just bought the def ed for $10 online, looking forward to it!  My wife might enjoy it also, she is looking for a few games to play.  Apparently doing Gears4 co-op with me is not her thing...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	Great game! Would say more of an 8 and also that some bits are REALLY tough!!! I picked it up for £6.50 so great price :) 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	"Got this free from my library. Just wanted to point out that there's standard Metroidvania style teleporters in the game (like Symphony of the Night had), which I think IS a kind of fast travel actually.

Edit: Oh... that was an upgrade from the Definitive Edition. Shows what I know!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	This came bundled with my Xbox and I haven't touched it until a few hours ago.  It's one of the best looking games I've ever played, possibly the best.  In terms of combat and movement, the review gets it pretty spot on.  Powers are really rewarding to get and fun to use.  If you don't have it, get it.  I promise you'll have a great time.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	@Skydog6301 Im gonna take your word for it, its only 10$ on the summer sale for me, i get the additional 10% off for being n xbox live rewards VIP so 10$ for a game that i have had no interest in since you know, faout 4, witcher 3 and ark took most of tht time up i think im gonna give this a shot.   I will be back too let you know what i think lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	I love this game.  So much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	I mostly agree with this review, but I don't think he emphasized enough just how good this game looks.  Possibly the most beautiful 2D graphics ever seen in a video game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	I actually felt sad for once from a game.....great game, a must own!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	Good game. Only Xbone game I own or am even interested in.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/ori-and-the-blind-forest-review	I feel like this game has been forgotten, but it just came out this year. For those looking for something to fill the summer gaps in gaming, this is a game worth considering. I love it! Right up there with Guacamelee and Shovel Knight for my favorite indie game of all time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review	You forgot to add that the ending sucked so hard, I was half tempted to kick myself in my own nuts just for having sat through that disaster. If I could have dislocated my hip to do so, I would have kicked myself in my own nuts. That ending was horrible. I actually felt myself lose 25 points of IQ as the intelligence was sucked out of my head into my mouse which grew icy cold to the touch. Its like they spent the whole expansion TRYING to make something worth playing, and then when the writers got to the end, it was time to go home so they just slapped some half-ass convoluted piece of s**t idea onto the white board and called it a day! HORRIBLE ending.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review	THE YETI IS REAL
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review	unknown, unexplored races, creatures. as we all know any new race or creature is always kept away from the public and tried to be kept secret you know a myth is real when they make jokes about it as advertisements which they do for many myths. by the way monkeys do climb trees who's to say bigfoot doesn't climb trees you seen how they catch monkeys in nets well try catching bigfoot like that, with the evolution of a man and monkey and with most a man's brain. people always deny evolution but it's in front you 24/7 365 all around you something is changing but yet people believe the biggest myth of all religion over reality and yet there's not crumb of evidence that religion is what it claims to be. there's much evidence that evolution exists because nature is all around you. people grow up watching movies where someone is almost always saved from someone or something so now we read books thinking christ is going to come down and bring you all to heaven and save you. the reality is no one is going to be saved from this planet. and people hope for this crap like there actually suffering a burning hell from living on earth the only thing that suffers is there brain reading religion.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review	1 shot with the AMR kills the Yeti but you don't get that until very late in the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/far-cry-4-valley-of-the-yetis-dlc-review	Good review and yeah dummies if you didn't like the core game don't get the DLC; how stupid are you to complain about the game here like people give a crap about your pathetic complaints?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/09/dmc-devil-may-cry-definitive-edition-review	Was this a complete remastering in the same vein as Last of Us or Uncharted Collection? This just looks like increased framerates
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	Dragon ball xenoverse 2 is the worst game invented in dragon ball history, i loved the idea of playing xenoverse 1 when it came out because it gave you the opportunity to fight alongside goku & the other z warriors, & also create your own character, perfect sounding game right? so i bought it, played it, loved the story, then i got more into it and started playing player matches, endless battles, and mostly ranked matches, and became very high up on the score boards. THE absolute main reason i loved this game is because of the combat, the fact that you had to be patient and watch your opponents move, perfect block it, take your time, make them look like their week even tho their trying so hard. It was an absolutely great game especially for that reason, now on to the reason that xenoverse 2 is so not worth your time or money, in xenoverse 2, 90 percent of the same idea of xenoverse 1 is duplicated in xenoverse 2, the story mode is almost identical which is repetitive and very boring, #2 xenoverse 2 combat style smh, & i cant stress this enough, the combat style has been brought down to a mediocre level, its straight up attack as fast as you can and break guards, and blast blast ki blast and die, especially with the added flight attacks that are almost impossible to block, its such a downgrade, its no longer fun, its becoming like one of those games that someone with no knowledge of games can just press buttons on and win the battle, i would never give this game a 7.5 star rating, especially compared to xenoverse 1, xenoverse 2 deserves a 2 star rating and thats being generous, i would of hoped for a xenoverse 3 but after seeing xenoverse 2 i can only imagine what else will be ruined, & dont get me wrong im a huge dragon ball z fan so you gotta understand my frustration, theres much more on this topic that i didnt even get into, but ill just leave it at that, ill just stick to watching the dragon ball super series, & i also have a few complaints about that too, i dont want to see anymore side episodes, i dont watch dbz to see them play baseball or be corny, i love the action and villains the brutal fights, but thats for another day, i know im not the only one that feels this way about this topic & if not lets see if we can make a change, peace
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	"sooo many butt hurt fanboys, 
guys... get over it, the game sucks, the developers threw this together because they knew every single one of you would drool over it no matter what. 
Demand more and you will get more, children."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	"@CorpsePile Only child I see here is you. I mean only a child uses such petty terms like ""butthurt"" and ""fanboys""."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	Fans of Dragon Ball Z will not be disppointed. The fighting isn't GREAT, but it's good enough. I just wish, with the time traveling, they would have peppered in some Dragon Ball stuff. I just feel like Dragon Ball never gets the love it deserves.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	"you obviously dont know how to play, and the missions are unfair to you because of the same reason, you describe the combat shallow because your are shit at the game and you are so bad at it that the best thing you can do is button mashing, you disgust me with your reviews you irrelevant old pickle eating American pigs
Fuck Off mate"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	What can I say? As an American, pickles are much better than the feeble cucumber. Cucumbers are just too bland and a bit of vinegar turns them into the nectar of the gods. I agree with the first part of your comment though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	terribly review  iv played this game for so long now im at level 80 and have two characters. the combat is definitely better then all previous dbz games it is almost budokai tenkaichi 3 level with a touch of dbz legends. this is probably the best next and last gen dbz game to come out in years.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	To be honest- I almost felt the same as the reviewer in the first 2 hours of play.... But then you unlock more moves and learn how to combine more varied combos/attack options. Then I really became impressed! The combat is awesome but it is very difficult to become great at it instantaneously. The great thing is that the game is still enjoyable even if you never even tap into all that you can do in a fight. I was sold when I finally strung together a rush attack mid convo with a dazzling blast ending! It looked amazing and felt even better. Extra points for being accessible to my 7 year old son- the basic controls are very easy and straightforward so I don't think the reviewer ever really got into more technical fighting. It's like any rpg- yes you can spam your preferred strategy and beat the game. But it's more satisfying and enjoyable when you properly use a mix or status, magic, attacks and summons not just one emphasis. This is similar. But wow- the story and environment created to not just rehash the anime for the 100th is greatly appreciated. As others say, any fan of dbz needs this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	"Game plays like crap when it comes to mechanics. There are times where players and characters just fly all or in a frenzy no control.

The sagas doesn't make any sense what so ever when it comes to balance and powers. Cell Jr was harder than Cell himself, Android 17 & 18 felt like final boss fights even with a HIGH level character.  

Super Saiyan doesn't even make a difference like in Budokai Tenkaichi 3 or any other title before this crap."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	@dtherebel Finally someone who understands
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	The only thing I would change would be the team combat crap in offline parallel quests. No reason why you couldn't use the characters already in the timelines and Trunks/Kai of Time. Taking two supporters plus the in timeline characters dramatically overcrowds the environment. On a lot of stages my combos are broken by supporters
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	Says Cheap Mission design, maybe the game is just to hard for Ign
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/04/dragon-ball-xenoverse-review	"This is a very one-sided review. This game is amazing. There is nothing dull about the combat, there's many, many things you can do mixing and matching combos and skills giving you the chance for a custom experience. The game is a challenge making it fun to play. If you don't like that, there are other games to play.
No, the game is NOT perfect. There are things I would change as well. For any DBZ fans looking for fun and challenge, this game is a must by."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/03/olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood-review	Honestly this game took sometime getting used to but once your brain clicks and you get the timing down. The game gets it's hooks in to you. When playing this game you will say one more try and 15 minutes later your still be playing trying to master that level long combo. Prefect game to pick up and play on the vita especially in those pesky psn outages.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/03/olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood-review	"Here's some a great song for playing this game if you have Spotify on PS4 or whatever.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/03/03/olliolli-2-welcome-to-olliwood-review	Solid_Duff is right i like THPS also but as someone who likes fighters too this game is like crack because the motions reminds me of pulling special moves but focus is needed to be able to nail perfect landings for those big scores.

This is so pathetic that if Team Ninja brought back Tomonobu Itagaki to make a Current Console Generation Ninja Gaiden, I would almost not buy it...Almost. As a gamer though I possess that amazing ability to hate everything about you and still give you all my money, time and energy playing your game. It's kind of like the Force but way better, and only Gamer's and God (at least that's what another gamer told me) have it.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/23/dead-or-alive-5-last-round-review	Honestly the only bad side to this game for me is the online. I'm unable to play ranked matches for some reason but I can create and enter lobbies without an issue. As for DOA having clone characters, look around, SF has more Ryu clones than it does other characters and nobody complains about that. I play Tekken, but DOA has a nice fighting system. This is the first one I've played and I'm definitely glad I burned that $40 bucks for it.

This man knows his DOA. I've been using Hayate after starting out as a SS Ein User in DOA2U. Ein is just a waste of a Roster spot now."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/23/dead-or-alive-5-last-round-review	I can't wait to buy it for my ps4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	Loving this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	Uh this game kinda blows. I don't think I've ever played a game where you get punished for winning. And the shuffling of the cards like that. What's the point of even showing you the choices. If I paid for this id be upset
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	Just got this from Games With Gold. Looks sick.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	Ahhh, I'll buy it at a high price!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	"Probably the thing that surprised me most about this game was how interesting the mini-'quests' often were. Many of the cards you play to win tokens will unlock a next level card which will play out as its own little story. It's very well done.
The script and narration is also top notch. It has a stylized quality that, whilst different in theme, reminds me a lot of Darkest Dungeon; another very well written, rather unusual 'dungeon crawler' that released this year (albeit in early access).
The other particularly awesome thing is that there is a spider that occasional appears and scuttles around when on the table screen. That isn't the awesome part; the awesome part is that there is an option to remove the spider in the menu. And I find this compelling game of semi-controlled chance stressful enough as it is without that thing crawling around."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	I just bought this for $8.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	Seems like an interesting game, ill probably check it out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/20/hand-of-fate-review	The game deserves a better score! It's something fresh and new and it's done well for a small studio... I guess if it had the grease for palms like EA or Activision does Ito advertise it would have gotten a better score? RPG fans, D&D fans pick this game up you will enjoy it and it's only 20$

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	"I'm not sure how you can say that the pacing is sluggish when the whole story and gameplay is barely 8 hours, to me that makes zero sense, and I certainly never felt like I was getting bored. I bought The Order 1886 based purely on watching a 3 minute video of the gameplay and being hugely impressed by the graphics, which is something I never do, I also didn't look at any reviews and went in without knowing exactly what the game was about and I have to say I was very pleasantly surprised.

It definitely deserves more than a 6.5 purely for how amazing the graphics, atmosphere and setting are, this is what the next gen should look like. I actually thought the story and character development were pretty good too, and I even found myself growing quite attached to the characters, a lot more so than I do in most other games definitely. Sure, it is let down by its behind the times mechanics and short play time, but this just left me wanting more, and the story was conveniently stopped at such a point that it is obviously wide open for a sequel, with many questions still unanswered.

The Order 1887 anyone?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	" Im playing it for the first time and i think this game is so well done and the story and atmosphere is very good. It deserves way more than a 6.5.  Its an 8 or 9 in my book.
Shame on IGN."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	@rick2079 It's definitely a solid game. I think the combat could have been improved but not a bad game at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	that's a lot of comments
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	Indeed. https://youtu.be/3PbE3k9LG9A
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	So I bearly played this game after a long time it realeased and I have to say it is a really good game. I think the reason it got such a low score is because people were thinking that next gen was going to be a super evolutionary thing. now that we know what next gen really is I think this game can be apreciated a lot more.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	@ChakaMeat Definitely!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	This is an awesome underrated and perhaps misunderstood game. Excellent mix of action and story which i can't remember ever being achieved in any other shooter. Absolutely loving playing it. 6.5 is a disgraceful score. The reviewer didn't get it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	@xXDartherXx If I want to watch a movie, I'll get a movie. A game is to be played. Screw the QTE and cinematic crap. Most game stories are just hacked movie clichés anyway. If you saw them in a movie you'd just yawn.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	@xXDartherXx It definitely lived up to my expectations. Not perfect but still a good game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	This was better off a movie than a game tbh. I love the story, characters and atmosphere but the gameplay (what little exists) is terrible and boring. I was stunned when the end came as there were so many loose ends and it didn't feel like an appropriate ending. It felt rushed. I do hope that if a sequel ever sees the light of day they make it a completely different style of game. Almost like an arhkam game perhaps with more monsters than humans to fight, good fighting mechanics, more historical easter eggs to find and some actual places to explore and free roam for more stuff. Rpg elements would be great too. One can dream...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	This game was has an amazing art direction and atmosphere like the review said but it lacks in content big time. I platinum the game in 8 hours!!! And once you do that there is no more left to play in the game. There is no worthy reason to replay this game. When I bought it at the E3 sale it was $6.50 and honestly thats all this game is worth to me but when they initially released it at $60 I would have been pissed off beyond belief if I bought it then. Sequel better add a lot more content to complement the games atmosphere
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	There will be no sequel, sadly, because of reviews like IGN - critics sunk this game and now there will never be another chapter - this is straight from Ready At Dawn Studios.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	@Christian.J.Williams Critics didn't sink the game, Ready At Dawn did.  Critics simply accuratley reported on what an inconsequential game this is.  Ready At Dawn released an incredibly pretty game with almost no gameplay and an unfinished storyline. Half the game was cut scenes, another 1/4 of it QTE's, and what was left was such a handheld, on-rails experience that is was as limiting as it was enjoyable.  So much promise, but the failure to develop that promise lies firmly in Ready At Dawn's lap.  It plays more like a demo than a full game, and one that never really lets you cut loose and explore or enjoy its game world at that.  2/5 stars for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	"Bought this during the E3 sale.
Immersive atmosphere, enjoyable story, and great voice acting, but man this game suffers from major pacing issues.
There's a lot to improve if a sequel were to come, but there's no chance of that happening at this point."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	This game is a true turd. Bought it for 7 dollars and will end it, on Chapter 9 now. Slow, boring and letterbox-ed. A true Turd.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	No, it is not. You simply don't have the patience or attention span to allow you to appreciate the artistry and incredible achievements of this game. Perhaps the latest Call of Shoot-'Em-Up Multiplayer-Fest would be more to your liking.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	I'm engrossed, impressed, and don't give a shite about there not being multiplayer or open-world elements because not every single game should work that way - diffrerent can be good, and same-old-thing can get boring. This game is incredible and I wish I'd played it sooner rather than let reviews like this one, which is clearly written by someone who prefers multi-only and doesn't value incredible storytelling, scare me away. You can almost hear the guy saying, 'blah, blah stop with the talking get back to the shooting!' Such impatience ruins attempts at artistry in gaming like this. It's too bad people with limited points of view sunk this game and any hopes for a sequel because it's magic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/19/the-order-1886-review	This review I found is *far* more objective and less biased than IGN's ham-handed hack job. http://www.psxextreme.com/ps4-reviews/64.html
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse-review	No mention of couch multiplayer in the video review... I wonder hot that is.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse-review	The thing about Nintendo is they cater to a lot of different game types, so I do see how you might not like something. I recommend Gamefly.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse-review	Maybe you should have bought Super Mario 3D World or Rayman Legends.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse-review	I guess you haven't played Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze, Bayonetta 2, or Hyrule Warriors. They have a bit more challenge.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse-review	I see your point. My favorite PS4 game has been Infamous Second Son, I liked it more than Sunset Overdrive on Xbox One. As far as the Wii U there are too many to says. Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze was solid and Super Mario 3D World is a lot of fun. I also really enjoy Mario Kart 8 and Hyrule Warriors. The online play on Wii U is free and works well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/18/kirby-and-the-rainbow-curse-review	I'm making a claymation at the moment,so I think this is a really interesting concept for a game.

Still not game. But I hope they can save it somehow"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	Nobody plays this game anymore.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	maybe this day in age anything different than call of duty will easily get a good rating. But then again, 9 is REALLY pushing it. For what has been seen as a $60 dlc store, I'm going to lean towards the fan reaction of a 6.9 here. People are tired of the same thing every match. And even though evolve requires a shit ton of teamwork where most other games don't, I can see it easily getting that same call of duty feel after a while.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	COD generation is the reason this game gets so much hate.  They need dumbed down, run and gun, spray and pray gaming.  Where, just about ANYBODY can pick it up and do somewhat decent within 30 minutes of play.  This game requires a healthy dose of planning and teamwork....something lacking among the public player base, especially on consoles.  Bottom line, it was hard to win and took time to learn tactics that worked.  Therefore, it was doomed to fail with the COD generation.  The same idiots who, essentially, have been buying THE SAME GAME since COD, MW. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	@Rays1074 No they don't. They needed to stop putting overpowered DLC characters in the game - ruining it for people who don't want to spend more money on a game that doesn't have $60 worth of content. Not to mention there is over $250 worth of DLC; which is laughable and shows how lazy the developers were. The multiplayer is also dead - and rightly so.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	I have play game about 1500 hours, must say game system sucks, but when u get ´game on and u hunt or play monster its so nice! Game needs updates to connection problems, players finding system, sometimes u wait player 10min and game might take 3min. Ranked games are so weard sometimes, u never know now many points u get or lose, there is no any logic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	@petsamo what the actual fuck...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/11/evolve-review	Welcome back to IGN's BS of being paid for good reviews because Angry Joe gave this game a 5 and was ranting for most of the video about all of the DLC, lack of a story, non-interesting characters because they only have small interactions. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	"Stop this bullshit of taking away score because it doesn't have a hint system.
People just want games to take them by the hand these days..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	This reviewer is crazy! :D 9.3?! It's a 7.5-8 max. He says it aged well, and it didin't! The graphics are ugly, the controls and camera are really flawed (it has more bugs and glitches than Fallout :P), and the puzzles are not logic at all and it will take you hours (without a guide) to find the solution because the game doesn't tell you what to do next.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	By the way, I've beaten this game in 98, so I knew what it was before the remastered version. And what was remastered?! And don't see a big difference.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	"@Stromgol HUGE fan of the game original too... Just got a PS4 so thinking of picking it up since I have some BB credit but ugh, I don't know.  Was really hoping for a ""true"" remaster and not just a ""remaster"".  Why not have a true widescreen mode AT LEAST?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	"Amazing and creative story, I love this sense of humor, remembers me Arrested Development, but the puzzles are too hard or too strange sometimes, that put down a lot of fun.
The creator, Tim Schafer, said that he had some difficult to replay the game these days, so you can imagine the level of the puzzles."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	So sorry I bought this. I find it uninteresting and a real chore to get through.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	It'd already release. Plus, if you have a hard time trying to solve the puzzle (since this game doesn't have a game hint), I recommend to search it on google. Find a gamming hint, and no worries, no spoilers. Unless you do it on your own, it's fine.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	"About halfway through this game, and the review seems pretty spot on. The art style and dialogue have aged really well. Looks and sounds like a modern game. The pre-rendered background and fixed camera definitely harken back to an older era.
I appreciate that it's sticking to not having a hint system but some puzzles do seem brutal though.
I'm glad this got remastered since I've never played it before. And it's certainly charming and bursting with personality. Spoiler-ish: when I went on stage to recite poetry, got boo-ed off, only to have the girl repeat my poem for applause... I laughed out loud at that!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/grim-fandango-remastered-review	"A nice person gifted me this on Steam so i finally got to play the remastered edition. It is very easy to play but some areas that seemed really difficult are a breeze now such as the fire demons. I am sure you used to have to time things better there.
The music is amazing in this new release and the new character improvements is very good. I can see what people get at though as up-rezzing the old backgrounds does tend to spoil the quality look overall (not the excellent art design) but it's nitpicking on what is an essential adventure game to own."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	 Sorry but this game sucks and really bad. WTF are almost ALL of the characters all black or middle eastern? Racist game! Horrible camera angle and game controls ruin the game as well as poor story and lack of quests. Fallout 4 and The Last of Us are FAR superior games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	@mixxalot because the game takes place in a fictional city in turkey in the middle east?? wtf r u on? and there are tons of quests lol i doubt you've played the whole game i bet you gave up from the start after seeing one black person lmao.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	@mixxalot Your immediate comment is to point out the characters being black or middle eastern while disregarding the location used in the game?  How about sticking to the game instead of pointing our your own racism and prejudices.  I bet you are one of those dumb gamers who complains about the push for diversity in gaming.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	@mixxalot My god you are dumb...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	@mixxalot The game is in the Middle East, that's why the characters look middle eastern lol! There are also at least 51 side quests (according to IGN). But I feel you. This game is totally racist towards zombies. Zombie Lives Matter!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	"What's great about this game is that it keeps you challenged even as you max out your levels.  Once you make out all your upgrade you unlock ""legend"" which now allows you to add small percentage boosts to different catagories (one-handed weapon stregth, health, etc).  So you are always improving.  Also the enemies are diverse and increase in health and stregth.  Single zombies that might of been a challenge and are now one-hit kills begin to appear in large groups.  Specialty zombie appear more and mix in with the zombies.  Some move fast, some are strong, some you can't hide from.  And no matter how over powered I become I still never get over the fear of playing during the night (in game).  The volatile monsters all almost invincible even with the strongest weapons in the game at max strength.The added parkor is a great addition and makes sense quickly with why the jump button is on the sholder button.  You need to be able to look at where you want to grab onto while you jump and allows you to always kkeep both thiumbs on the joysticks.  It is really a well done game.  Very immersive and intense."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	Gonna buy this for 20$instead of the 45$ the following edition.Guess is more value for the money,rather buy other game with the diference
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	"PT. 2 - What your survivor level enables you to get is higher damage weapons. This is CRITICAL for the gameplay. With high damage weapons, you can slash your way through the zombie hordes and enjoy the gameplay to the max. Until you get past level 10 for survivor, the gameplay will be frustrating, you WILL die a lot if you get zombies on your tail, and you will not be able to kill zombies very easily. Grapple comes soon after that, and the game just gets better and better.
This game is one of the best I’ve ever played; I give it a 9.5/10 just for how much satisfaction it gives me. Just remember, don’t get frustrated, once you get your survivor ranking up, the gameplay gets exponentially better!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	"Dying Light is one of those games where you don’t want to stop playing and enjoy every time you start playing. The combat is superb and exiting, the parkour is outstanding, and the story gives you plenty of things to do when you want a mission of some sort. True, the story isn’t “amazing” but it’s certainly not terrible. The side quests are better than some of the story missions, and reward you well for your time. For the new people to the game, you will need to either farm or dump a bunch of time into the game until you get your survivor level ranked up to a decent amount, (17-20). You can do this easily by taking a few hours and simple repeating certain replayable quests to gain the supply packages you need to exchange for points to level up. While this took me 3 hours to get from level 3 to 25 (max), it’s definitely worth it. “The Stuffed Turtle” is the name of the quarantine zone I used to gain supply packages, just keep redoing it over and over until you get 160-170 packages, and then go and exchange them, and prepare for the fun.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	"story is good. it has it's flaws but it's not bad or ""so-so"""
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	Coming off of Fallout 4 and the Order 1886, I think this game is mediocre at best. The game is just frustrating. In the mission where you have to turn on the gas valves, one of them was so annoying to reach, I ran in a giant circle around the whole area, bumping into invisible walls and reaching for platforms/rocks that were blocked by invisible barriers. Time after time, certain zombie types pop out of no where and instantly kill you. Parkour isn't as clumsy as Assassin's creed, but I still fell off of buildings and structures a decent amount. It wouldn't be so bad if you didn't actually lose XP when you die. For a game that is supposed to encourage exploration, that's not exactly an encouraging mechanic. Combat is clunky and repetitive and not fun. Idk how this review exists or why Colin Moriarty raves about this so much. A part of me still wants to hold out for a couple of more levels for the grappling hook to see how I feel then, but at this point I'm turned off enough to be done.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	@supatastywaffles If you haven't gotten the grappling hook yet, you haven't really played this game, Stick with it and you will not regret it. It's one of my favorite games of the year. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	I will take your advice and try to go back at some point
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	Well, im scared that i waste SGD 79.00 for this game and get disappointed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	@Natanaelt life is like that sometimes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	"Totally. I just borrowed the game from a buddy and had the dodge in less than 2 hours. I think it was the very first thing I unlocked, actually.
Also, the game isn't really focused around combat. I kinda play this game like I'm playing Mirrors Edge. It's about running and avoiding confrontation and only engaging in combat when there's no other option. If you're going around with a wrench trying to kill everything that moves, you're playing the game wrong."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/26/dying-light-review	Every single thing you just said that the game doesn't have, the game has. You need to play more than 6 hours and gain skills, so you can dodge and roll and get better weapons. This is the very definition of judging a book by its cover. Rage somewhere else, or try and give it longer than 6 hours. Also, it absolutely sounds like you're not playing it right, because 6 hours in I already had the dodge ability.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/22/citizens-of-earth-review	Darn it...the concept sounds fun, but soooo much of this sounds game breakingly frustrating to me.  I'm seriously torn as to whether I should even bother starting it, or move on to a game I'll more likely enjoy...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/22/citizens-of-earth-review	Patch was just released that takes care of some of the problems. I didn't think the game was perfect but it's definitely a fun, humor filled retro RPG.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/saints-row-4-re-elected-review	Just started playing it because I got it free with PS+. What a crappy game and what are those PS2 graphics?! :S

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/saints-row-4-re-elected-review	I stop playing this after the 3rd. I didn't feel like it was staying on the ground level like it should.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/saints-row-4-re-elected-review	I'm playing this right now. Awesome game, lots of fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/saints-row-4-re-elected-review	Seriously, a 7.8? This game is so much fun and has so much personality. For me it's a high 9.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/saints-row-4-re-elected-review	Not bad for $15 on PSN... still needs patches though, don't know if we'll ever see those though.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	This deserves a 10/10  ign u are stoned again
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	"The original was my favorite game growing up. This captures the feel and they have done a great job remaking this. I'm looking forward to January for Resident Evil 2 remastered. It seems they will be re-mastering 2, 3 and maybe code veronica. Perhaps one day they remake 4, 5 and 6 with the fixed camera angles and survival horror we all know and love. It does sadden me that they changed the game play in recent games. I simple cannot be bothered with that over the shoulder view.

I think this game should be closer to 9/10. They could have given us a more extended ending. I always thought it was a little short. Can't have everything it seems.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	I was a kid in the 90s.  All I remember being was frustrated when playing this game.  Looking back now, I feel like it was kind of lame that I you pretty much needed a guide to complete this game.  That's what I love about the newer games- NO GUIDE REQUIRED!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	@_joejohn_ Trial and error my friend, I never needed a guide.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	Real Resident evil! Not the Resident evil 4 and onwards rubbish. Please remake 2 and 3. More importantly make new ones  similar to 1,2 and 3. Not action games like 4,5 and 6
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	@bobbobbob69 totally agree with you also code veronica is good too  1,2, and 3 were awesome games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/19/resident-evil-review	I liked Re4, I know that is heresy to most RE fans but I include it in my RE favorites. Did it change things up, like people had been begging for at the time ? Yes, and I agree that 5 and 6 took it to far into the run n gun/action category.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/super-mega-baseball-review	This is essentially RBI baseball for NES revised and a bit of depth added for replay value.  Fun game for somebody who just wants to pick up and play.  Unlike games like The Show where you have to study controls and really immerse in the game in order to get the right result on the field.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/super-mega-baseball-review	Reminds me of The Bigs.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/super-mega-baseball-review	I don't think this review does this game justice.  It is extremely addictive!  The physics amazing.  Stadiums interesting.  I am definitely very focused when playing this.  I don't find anything repetitive or annoying. And the stats keeping is amazing!  Perfect alternative if you find MLB too stuffy and want an arcade baseball experience.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/super-mega-baseball-review	This game is so addictive and I love the difficulty setting. I agree with IGN though, the presentation could use a lot of work.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/01/07/super-mega-baseball-review	It was $5 this weekend for a flash sale.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/18/destiny-the-dark-below-review	What I can't stand is the fact that 500 million went into this game and it seems like 99.99 percent went into the marketing and the CEO's of the companies and over paying other people like Peter Dinklage.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/18/destiny-the-dark-below-review	No it doesn't, all that you get is an awful leveling system once you pass level 20. It gets worse after 20 actually.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/18/destiny-the-dark-below-review	If Bungie actually keeps going for 10 more years they'll be bankrupt by the end. 500 million went into this game, and it seems like only .5 million ever went into the game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	What makes this different from 2048?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	This is the game 2048 was based upon. It's also got more personality. 2048 is just using the mechanics. Threes is also being cute and original about it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	"Threes!: Nine tips, hints and cheats (pt. 1)
1. Work the corners
While some folks prefer to play the center, the most widely accepted method of doing well in Threes! is to get your high-scoring cards in one of the corner and perpetually move cards in that direction. This means most of your gameplay will only involve moving in two directions. With the highest-scored tile right in the corner, it minimizes how much chasing you have to do to match it up. Besides, there aren’t going to be many cards to pair up with your top one, so a central, easily-accessible location is better served by lower-value cards. With other high-value cards drifting in the same direction, it’s easy for them to find their matches huddled around that corner.
2. Don’t chase matches
Sometimes it can be tempting to beeline for big matches without considering anything else on the board. Though you may very well get that big match, you can also find yourself with few free spaces afterwards. Often in these situations, your high-scoring pair will be close enough together that you can clean up a few other cards while still keeping them together.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	Great game on the phone, not really sure it's a console worthy game though … or worth A$10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	will never take mobile gaming seriously, there is something to be said about sitting down and devoting undivided attention to a game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	This really showcases the power of the Xbone. Welcome to current gen.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	How did this get a higher score than dragon age..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	Its a diffrent kind of game. Threes is a mobile puzzle. You cant compare a mobile puzzle too a mass open world AAA game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	he wasnt comparing the games .. he was comparing the scores ....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	cause dragon age was inexorable

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	Looks really addicting. I enjoy all kinds of games and there are definitely times where I am in the mood for simple games like this. I thoroughly enjoyed Peggle 2 on Xbox One and still play Tetris from time to time. Hell, I even still play Galaga, Asteroids and various Pac Man games here and there. Its refreshing to play something basic and fun from time to time. Will definitely be picking this up.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/threes-review	People need to understand you can't compare a arcade/mobile game to a full retail title or a standard arcade game, otherwise they'd all get below 5's. It's a simple arcade game thats executed brilliantly. They're all in their own leagues, don't blur the lines as it doesn't work.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/09/just-dance-2015-review	I'm having trouble with Just Dance 2015. Every time I dance to one song, after that or in the song it freezes. It will repeat the same part of the song over and over and there is no solution unless you turn it off and turn it back on, after EVERY dance which gets extremely irritating. Is there anyone I can call to report my problem and see if there is any fixes?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	I actually came here to see the score because we've experienced lots of glitches as well as what you said. I'm surprised they didn't mention online issues in the review. Im also surprised it scored an 8.1!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	they probably didnt even play online, or just with friends (like the designers and testers mostly did, so when it went online, BOOM, oops didnt thought of that lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	Probably one of the worst game ive ever played. Not that bad in single mode or with couch coop, but playing with random players, everytime they leave or someone join, you go back to the menu to select your character. yesterday, in maybe 20min, we had like 10-12 different players coming, leaving, coming leaving.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	If this is one of the worst games you've ever played you must not have played many games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	that's true that i didnt played many games that have a online system as f#### as this one.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	I bought this game a couple months ago, and yesterday I finally started to play it. It looks a little like Trine 2, but worse. I wouldn't recommend it if you already have some other games to finish...but it is a decent time waster, if that is what you're looking for
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	"I can't tell if some of these comments are serious...but I'll bite
You do all realize that ""Tomb Raider"" and the ""Lara Croft"" game are now essentially two separate franchises, right? This isn't a ""step back"" from Tomb Raider, it's a different game for a different style of play. Continuity-wise, they are in no way connected. The ""Lara Croft"" games are either their own timeline or complete one-offs.
Also, I get the feeling that the reviewer didn't play ""Guardian of Light?"" I'm sorry if I'm wrong, it's just that the way you phrase things suggests it. The original has a ""lightweight"" story, and Lara is doesn't say much either. This doesn't carry over from ""Tomb Raider"". The ""Lara Croft"" games are about the gameplay and puzzles. Puzzles and enemies also completely changed depending on if you were doing SP or Co-op.
The first game was a great bang for your buck, especially if you nabbed it free with Games with Gold. I was surprised at how much content and replayabilty there was for an arcade title. THIS is how arcade games should be. Can't wait to play this, and can't wait for Rise of the Tomb Raider."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	It's so funny seeing everyone whine and complain about Crystal Dynamics just because SQUARE ENIX (not crystal) decided to make a deal with MS to make it exclusive. Crystal is a great developer and this game looks great. You all can make a stand by not buying the game, but that just sucks for you. I'd rather not be petty and support good games
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	This isn't even the Microsoft exclusive tomb raider lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	Thanks for telling us what you would do and shaming anyone who doesn't want to support that stuff. :/ I'll never understand why people have a opinion on what someone else chooses to do with their money.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	what is this crap?? it looks nothing like the tomb raider 2014!!!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	Wow. What a huge step backwards from the previous game. The last one (ultimate edition) was really good on PS4.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	idiot^^
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	Maybe because this has nothing to to with the that version?? Hmmm....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	I probably would have bought this if Crystal Dynamics didn't give PS4 owners the shaft. They can suck it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	Once again, WRONG GAME.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	No. I was talking about Osiris. Im not buying it because of CD's stupid Rise of Tomb Raider exclusivity. Why should I buy their shitty spin off game if they aren't going to make the next main installment available for me. So fuck off.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	So it's well crofted, I guess it's worth to check it out
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/08/lara-croft-and-the-temple-of-osiris-review	I really liked Guardian of Light. Eager to check this out.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/rugby-15-review	Well said.  I do like the game due to its simplicity, but I would prefer to have more advanced options.  There should be a way to pick and go from tackles rather than forming rucks.  There should also be options to run plays from set pieces.  Penalties only seem to have the option of the fly half tapping to himself and running forward. A practice mode would also be beneficial/helpful.  If I am incorrect and these options do exist, please let me know.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/rugby-15-review	I love this game, very fun, enjoyable, and FUNNY AS HECK. The glitches are hilarious and funny. I have spent many hours into this game and i do not regret any of it. I love this game more than i love myself. I will remember for the rest of my life. Without a doubt my best game of 2015. Good job BigBen interactive for making a masterpiece. KEEP UP THE GREAT SERIES, IT HAS MUCH POTENTIAL. I honestly don't know why this game has so much hate, i love it, playing with friends has never been more fun. cant wait for rugby 16 or 17!!! i rate this game a solid 9.8/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/rugby-15-review	WHO THE HECK IS SAYING THIS GAME IS RUBBISH, THIS IS THE BEST GAME OF THE YEAR AND I CANT WAIT FOR 2016, if Big Ben dosent release 16, this game will go down in the books, i have spent many hours playing this piece of history PLZ MAKE A SEQUIL 10/10 1/1 2/2 3/3 4/4 5/5 6/6 7/7 8/8 9/9 5 Stars

This does not showcase the sport of rugby well and should not add to it's rep."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/rugby-15-review	If you somewhat understand rugby and play this with a friend, it's so ridiculous that it becomes fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/04/rugby-15-review	"They should of took their time to perfect the game.
Instead they rushed it and stripped multiple modes from the game that would of given this game more than a 2.0 Rating.
And if they actually used the real power of the PS4 And Xbox one then this game wouldn't look like a PS2 Game.
If they are making Rugby 16 then i hope that they take their time to actually make a decent game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	Well there's one thing that I can't stand to this game. Is the online.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	This game is now £10 on the PSN store...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	Should I buy for 29.99 off the PSN store plus I want the Mclaren F1 that 3.99 as well I played the trail I like the game cockpit view and the clutch I did the xfinity challenge and the RUF (Porsche) and I like the handling and how it performed I'm really debating to get this game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	All this being said the game is alright. So long as you can get the damn thing to work, it's online only so if there are any problems with the server you aren't gonna be playing anything.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	As some have already mentioned, only just now started playing this game (thanks GwG) and I'm hooked. Can't believe I passed this one up. The charm of this game is easily its size and depth. Calling it massive is an understatement. It probably takes about an hour of real driving just to make it from one coast to the other. Once you get into the PvP matches and start making serious money is when it gets infinitely better. Agree with the reviewer, the main story is kinda corny and the graphics aren't the best out there, but there's more than enough elsewhere to make up for it. I'd give the game a 7.5, really interested to see how they handle a sequel.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	Honestly not sure if have paid full price for it but driving around the fake US is really cool
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	It is pretty sweet getting this game for free. I would give it a 7 out of 10. The open world is impressive but I have yet to find a good way to get money. Everything in the game cost so much unless you pay the micro transactions. The graphics are nothing to be pleased about either. Maybe I am comparing this game way too much to Forza Horizon but I would have easily 5 to 10 cars in 2 hours of Forza then with my 4 hours with only 1 car still in The Crew. Plus the customization of paint and decals is free in Forza where i am paying 2k for a different color in The Crew, are you freaking kidding me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	Love this game cannot believe I overlooked it when it debuted. Glad I got it for free and now I will support it by buying the dlc. This game deserves way more than a 6.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	"Who writes these reviews for IGN? Do you even play the game you review? I've been playing this game for the past 8 hours. For one thing. It's a OPEN WORLD, ROLE PLAYING RACING GAME.. It's not ""Forza""... So annoying seeing someone compare this game to pure racers when this is clearly so much more then just a racing game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	"Just a  warning from one who has bourght the game:
-The servers are down for days on end, and since its an online-only game this means that you've paid an AAA-price, but are not able to use it.

When voicing critique of how they treat their paying customers and the state the game/support is in - you get banned from the games forum. Very convenient way of solving its problems? ;- )

Even on the less populatet non-English forums there's discussions of class-lawsuits for non-playability ( for example in January 2016: http://forums-fr.ubi.com/showthread.php/100657-Soucis-de-connexion-sur-la-version-PC?s=2b912acdaaf925153f9b8b6bc9b4335c ).

So.... If you want to waste your money and get banned for asking that it becomes playable: Head right over to Ubishatz'.

Ps:  The graphics update? Sure, along w. glitches, bugs and returning ""sorry, you cant play your game - try tomorrow"". What a scam that game/company is!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/02/the-crew-review	"@Northerngamer81 Ubisoft just did this exact same thing with Tom Clancy's ""The Division"" that was released a few months ago. Ubisoft is advancing so much in terms of Graphics and game play it's very difficult to release a game that's with out glitches and bugs."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/game-of-thrones-episode-1-iron-from-ice-review	None of the decisions you make have any bearing on the outcome of the game.  I'm guessing you played this once through and thought you had shaped the story somehow.  You didn't.  This game is crap. 2/10 maybe.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/game-of-thrones-episode-1-iron-from-ice-review	this game blew me away. the ending WOW! at least for me i chose to meet up with ramsay in the hall i never thought a game would shock me as it did
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review	This game delivers the goods. It's great in every way. Now...I know it's not some obscure indie so obviously IGN being the hipsters they try to be...won't give this a 9 it deserves. There's nothing negative to say really. Great game! 9/10!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review	currently addicted to this.. fun game, simple yet clever
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/12/01/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-review	I finally got this game after not getting it for Christmas for whatever reason and I really really like it. Definitely in my top 5 WiiU games list.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	Anyone know if this will show up on the switch store or do we have to buy a physical copy?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	@HomemadeMask It's available on the Switch store now :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	"Shitty arcade game.

Even Snes games had much more detail in them.
Actually, Snes games are wonderful."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	You obviously have not played this game before or you just suck at it. I just played this game for five hours with almost no breaks, I may not have won, but I still enjoyed it a lot.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	"I have hundreds of games, some of which I've never even seen much past the title screen, but I have spent more time playing Isaac than most of the rest combined. It's so insanely addicting, and the ""just one more playthrough"" when you die is hard to ignore. And on the rare times when I actually do win, I feel like I just medaled at the Olympics. Just one of the most fun games I've ever played. I wanted to share it with my girlfriend's son, but I don't think she'd appreciate me playing a game featuring poop and urine and in which the goal is to kill your own mother. Oh well, his loss."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	The trophies are still glitched. I've unlocked a bunch of characters and never received the trophies for it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	"It gets very addicting. There are unlockable characters, bosses and stages and there is a great feeling of challenge and accomplishment. There is a sense of discovery every time you play and it's fun to have a character that is powerful. There are challenge modes and many, many secrets.
You are right, you are technically fighting random battles in random dungeons over and over again, but that's boiling down the game to it's simplest form, which you can do with any game. I really do recommend it. I thought it wasn't my type of game due to it's top down play style (I don't particularly care for top down games, including the top down Zelda games that this game is inspired by) but after getting it with PS+ I couldn't believe how much I played it. I recently got back into after spending around 30 hours with it when it first came to PS+, and I'm still seeing new things every playthrough."

Having said that, I enjoy the hell out of it. I just freaking die all the time."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/the-binding-of-isaac-rebirth-review	I suck at this game. I just can't seem to survive.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/25/tales-from-the-borderlands-episode-1-zero-sum-review	Now that the final episode is about to drop, I've decided it is time to jump in. Just finished episode 2. Possibly the funniest game I've played, probably my favourite Telltale game yet. I don't like Borderlands, either, but always felt it was a world that deserved better writing and storytelling. Well, here it is.

It would be very helpful, and maybe some bad reviews would make Telltale get their crap together and start releasing actual Lego games on Vita and 3ds without removing everything. It's not like the handhelds can't handle them. They are LEGO games.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/gta-5-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-review	Going into a random multiplayer server for GTA V is scary, considering most people on the servers have no interest in actually playing with you, but trying to kill you over and over, especially if you're a low level player. However the trick to avoiding long wait times is to get a group of friends that will log in and actually play the missions with you. On the Xbox 360, I have a whole group of friends that play and several of them are planning on getting the Xbox one version soon. Just got my copy today but I'm thinking that I might hold off on transferring my existing online character for later.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/17/gta-5-playstation-4-and-xbox-one-review	for me its a 8.5 because gta online its made for the dude with level 300000000 with all guns at 100% and there are users rthat like messing around in director mode like me or in story mode rockstar almost never updaes singleplayer or director mode so 1.5 points less  for not caring about single player

SONIC LOST WORLD is 5.8
SONIC AND THE BLACK KNIGHT is 3.9
SONIC BOOM SHATTERED CRYSTAL is 4.0
You see where I'm going with this?
So, Sonic Unleashed is worse than Sanic 06. Makes sense...
Sonic and the Black Knight is the worst sonic game. Fair enough...
Sonic Lost World is only 1 point higher than Sanic 06. Totally agree...
Sanic Bum Rize of Lyricz is better than Shittered Crystal. True...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review	"@WhyAmIEvenHere @slawa123 I agree, I have seen similar unfair grading whit other games. My belief is that IGN is are really corrupt and broken now a-days.
It's like if a game is released by Sega or released on a Nintendo console it will get a low grade. My guess is Sony or Microsoft are paying them a lot of money to grade this way.
And yeah, this stops Sega from ever releasing a console again and Nintendo suffers in sales. Wich is sad as both companies are both really good game and console developers.
And 2 companies that have a habit of releasing really broken, poorly optimized and buggy consoles get more sales instead.
But yeah, it looks like the Switch might be a big hit so hopefully that console might change all this."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review	@TimetravelerZero @WhyAmIEvenHere @slawa123 You're wrong. first, Activision is the one that pays 'em cash so COD games get good scores. second, read their Zelda: BOTW review. third, if you think they're corrupt WHY DO YOU HAVE AN IGN PROFILE? I don't think IGN is really that bad, they're simply okay nowadays
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review	@slawa123 I think it's because they're written by reviewers that have varying opinions on Sonic and his games. Hence why the PS2 and Wii versions of Sonic Unleashed have a 7.2 while the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions have a 4.5
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review	Sonic 06' was better than this. Why did they even ATTEMPT to make this game?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review	@MidAirBackstab Ask them. Maybe they know the answer.

I don't get why people prefer this version of Sonic... I mean, he's called Sonic the Hedgehog. He's not made really to explore, or move around like Crash Bandicoot or Ratchet and Clank or anything like that... He's just made to blast through levels. I don't ever play Sonic to get an intellectual experience or to get a full fledged Adventure game like Sly Cooper or, again, like the Crash Bandicoot games. I don't get this logic.
Of course, I will respect it, but I don't get it. I just dont."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/sonic-boom-the-rise-of-lyric-review	It's like this game was terrible on purpose... Sonic 06 suffered from a lack of awareness that it was a terrible game that was trying so very badly to be a good one. This game is most certainly much, much worse than Sonic 06.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	Cool, so all Fifa have to do is refuse to licence the UK teams for a reasonable amount, counting on people like you to buy their official game instead. Then they wait for Konami to die and without competition can release any old crap for top dollar prices. Nice plan!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	I bought PES 2015 on the XBO for $20. While it seems a decent game it doesn't seem that advanced from previous iterations. Graphically my PES 2006 looked better on PC (admittedly with mods) and PES 2008 on the Wii had more innovation. So a 9 seems a bit generous from what I've experienced so far.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	"Watch this video and think. This is pes 4. More than 10 years ago. The gameplay of this game is better than pes 2015. Pes 2015 is good only if you have to play HUMAN vs HUMAN in offline mode. Online is not working nor anybody is really playing anymore. Human vs cpu is offensive. Please, start to think this: hom many money have they taken during these years? A lot! How much has the gameplay been improved during these years? Nearly not at all. This game is a SCAM, and reviews like these are useless, and you are being convinced into buying the same game again and again. They are clearly not doing ANY work, and you are buying the same gain year after year. Are you mental? Start caring about how do you spend your money!

Is this a game? This is a ballet, a theatrical representation that forces the enacting of scenes that happen on the pitch. A game is supposed to let ME play!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	Bought both FIFA 15 and PES 15. Both are good with the licensing and presentation on FIFA top notch but i have to defer to PES as the better game due to the actual gameplay...it just feel like football. The numerous tactics that can be used and the player movement and AI movement is excellent. PES is more simulation while FIFA is more arcade like...to me. Both enjoyable game but I suggest PES for those that want a simulation experience or who actually play/played the game and FIFA who for those that just want a pick up fast pace game who may not have actually played the game at a reasonable level. Right now i'm playing PES a lot more and love the Become a legend mode... starting from scratch with a player i made up..did not want no superstar. My major complaint is that i would like more mediocre trophies for PES...like tfrst hat trick on BAL etc. Will eventually go back to playing FIFA since i just love football games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	I have to say I had Fifa 14 and thought it was good after a long hiatus of football games. I am actually loving pro evo 2015, it may not look as pretty in certain areas but theres just an element of this games which makes it stand out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	IGN should be ashamed of itself, giving the PC version of this game a 9.0, despite being a trainwreck. The console versions are decent games. Konami deliberately dumbed down the graphics for the PC, despite the GTX 980 being nearly twice as powerful as any console. Disgraceful.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	I can't decide which one to buy! Help me!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	Buy PES 2015. You won't regret it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	Yeah you will, if you buy it on PC. They decided to give the strongest machine the worst graphics.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	Better than FIFA.Yeah eat my sh*t. They don't even go through moderate team licensing costs. So, why the f*ck they are charging this much!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	Gameplay buddy gameplay.I was annoyed with licensing isue after playing the game however i really forgot about it. I became hooked on become a legend, MASTER LEGAUE and MyClub. Started FIFa 15 but got bored...will try it out again though since i must be missing something since so many people swear by it. Presentation on FIFA is top notch however.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	I was so pleased I bought this.... then realised there's no option files... .WTFffffff...no wonder the guy on ebay sold it for just £26 delivered!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/pro-evolution-soccer-2015-review	No option files meaning no custom packs and user mods? Ahh
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	Here's my honest 3 month late review of Far Cry 4 @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/pc/late-far-cry-4-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	Fun fun fun.  Gameplay is a bit repetitive like most of these action games but the option to deal with situations the way you see fit is great FUN.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	"This game is awesome, a solid 9 in my opinion. I understand where the reviewer is coming from regarding the characters and stereotypes and whatnot. BUT, you have to remember that this is a fictional country and most of the characters he is talking about are actually tourists/foreigners.

This game is $20 on Amazon now, more than worth the money. It's a blast to play. The world is absolutely beautiful. The collectibles are strangely addictive to roam around and find and the animals make the world feel alive. Yes, there are constant random events that pop-up like defending outposts and rescuing hostages and the like, but you can ignore them completely if you want. The events make it feel like there is actually a civil war going on and are fun when you're looking for something to do, but you can also ignore them if you're already doing something.

Awesome game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	@Luminousdiehardkille I found the Kyrat edition here (Brazil)for more or less 50U$ dollar,gonna buy it now,never played  any far cry,playind Dying Ligh now,amazing,hope Far cry is on he same level 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	This is one of the best games I own. Yeah the characters might not be fully developed, but this isn't a book where the storyline is the whole thing. Far cry 4 is really about taking down enemies using different approaches and just having fun with your friends. good job developers
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	All I want to know is, is Far Cry 4 online multiplayer throughout all the missions.  or is it like COD Advanced warfare when you are multiplayer  off hand.?  Does anybody know.  I can't seem to find a straight answer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	This game is superior to MGS V in nearly every way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	@DinkerMag If you wait at the table and get the quick ending, it has about as much story and character development as MGSV does, but it takes 30 minutes instead of 50 hours. If you actually play the game, they both fall flat pretty quickly.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	I literally was just going to comment that I started a new game in this two days ago (never beat it last year), and I'm having way more fun than I do with MGSV.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	I enjoyed FC4 much more than 3. I really hated the main protagonist and his pals in 3. Pagan Min was a terrific antagonist and his raid banter with Ajay was hilarious at times. There was one time Pagan chimed in about all the candles and was musing about how they were always lit, it was funny and little 4th wall breaking.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	"Now for those who
have played far cry 3 and loved it, you'll be happy to be greeted by the sight
of far cry 4 once the intro ends and you are thrown in a diverse, beautiful and
unforgiving world of the fictional Himalayan Kyrat. Because most of the controls,
aesthetics and mechanics of the game is heavily borrowed from Far cry 3, FC4 will feel a lot like FC3.5
instead of a completely new game, however, with its similarities comes also the
differences (multiplayer elements comes
into mind) that adds so much more fun into the game, making this game
feel very different from its predecessor at times.
The fictional
Himalayan Kyrat which the game is set in is a beautiful place with snow capped
mountains and huge scaling cliffs, which also hides ancient looking temples and
mostly interesting secret locations. However, as beautiful as the world is, the
game gave you no real reason to explore these locations other than it being
beautiful, yea sure there are collectibles within these locations but not all
of them are interesting enough for me to continue pursuing them, especially if
you're not one for reading chunks of texts in an action game. Most of the time
you will discover these places and bask in the glory of the beautiful next-gen
graphics and admire the huge world, but after that you will stand there asking
yourself, ""what's the point? there's nothing here."" The graphics of
FC4 is completely the same with FC3 with different Fauna and Flora models added
to the mix, although many may say that this can be a bad thing, I for one
thinks that it makes the game feel organic, and it doesn't alienate fans of FC3
such as myself. Overall the graphics make a lot of the secret locations worth
visiting, but there are no real depth to these locations, so after the first
few, you will stop caring about these locations and visit them only for the
statistical benefits for your character such as cash rewards, karma or simply
experience points when you find enemies there. but it's still a huge plus to
see that the developers stayed true to the original graphics as it definitely
assures me that I'm playing a FC game, and I love every bit of the action
elements of the game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	@SATONCHAIR Interesting review. I would say I agree with most of your points (save for any co-op or MP stuff, which is not of interest to me). I wasn't a big fan of FC3. I actually only finished it last month, having stopped playing in 2012 without finishing, and then doing a quick run through the story recently. I think the main island was wasted on Vaas, because I thought Hoyt was far more interesting. But that play, with some DLC, took me around 14 hours. Min tops them all, and having the mix of the two friendlies in FC4 I thought much more interesting than the random, no personality friends in FC3. Amita especially I thought came across very well (and we seemed politically similar, which I guess helps). I will say though, I only started enjoying the game after I modded the spawn sets to remove most of the obnoxious wildlife. So my only negative then comparative to FC3 is that it took longer to finish. Basically the rest, I agree, it improved. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/14/far-cry-4-review	Hell yeah!

crap multiplayer"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	Here's my honest 2 year late review of Dragon Age Inquisition @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/pc/late-dragon-age-inquisition-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	I would say an 8.8 review is within the realm of being an accurate score. I was very disappointed by the soul crushing grinding aspects of the game, the music/sound design was also poor ---- no music for 90 percent of the game when you are out grinding in the world?, I did not find the loyalty missions to be memorable except for one or two characters.  For a company that a has a long history of being innovators and masters of quality character development i felt this was a let down.    Additionally --- no one was up in arms about the DLC'd Tresspasser ending?   Bioware DLC'd the ending to a game --- AGAIN.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	This game is so bad, the graphics are poor, the voice overs are crap, the fighting is a stupid because there is none you just hold a button and it does it all for your its long with a story that makes no sense spent $28 and still feel like it's too expensive, just buy skyrim remastered will be better
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	@RichardBanger You are correct in one thing; skryim has better aspects when it comes to the open world and first person rpg. However, Dragon age has a compelling plot going for it (if you play from Origins -> Inqusisition). Oviously skryim has a better mage system and ranged system (rangers) for first hand batteling but try being a rogue or warrior slaughtering dragons, you need tactics you need movement. The graphics are not poor, play it on pc (full) or on playstation 4. It works, not the most high tech but a game is not only build up by high def but also by quality. Remember that. BTDUBS DAI IS CURRENTLY CHEAPER THAN SKYRIM!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	This is really cheap now. Is it worth buying? I love Mass Effect but never played any of the Dragon Age games. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	@FatboyFresh yep, i bought on sale in february and its awesome, i mean, the first is better in some ways, like a more deep character progression and more abilities but its a money well spent, try to get the goty version on sale, its totally worth the money if you're into this type of game 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	@brejamos Thanks. I grabbed it over the weekend and am enjoying it. It took a while for me to really get into it storewide but it's pretty fun now. I didn't get the GOTY edition but may get Trespasser DLC if I keep enjoying myself. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	@FatboyFresh I know this is a super late reply but, i would advise you to lay the whole dragon age series. The second one was nothing to write home about but it still tells the story
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	@ShayiraHal I beat it a few months ago and it was okay. Not anywhere near as good as Mass Effect. The main story was decent but the side quests weren't that great in my opinion. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	"I wanna play this game and i wanna like it, it really do, however I can't get over the graphics. I mean the environment looks alright and even really good in some places, but all the people looks wrong to me. The best way i could explain it is that they look too clean. Especially my personally favorite Varric, who is the main reason I have't bought this personally. I've watched play-throughs of some quests, seen reviews, but man I just can't justify playing something i don't wanna look at.

I played all other games, personally the first had my fave combat and the second had my fave designs, but from what i've seen and read it looks like i'm really not gonna like 3. Maybe, (since i've started switching gameing to pc) if it ever comes out as a bundle i'll play it, but until then, just no."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	"I started playing this game only because I downloaded it ""free"" in my EA Access vault, it seemed boring, but you must play the prologue (almost 6 hours it is a large game) and after that the story turn great and the game addicted, I think it is a great game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	Sounds like a good candidate for Games with Gold.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	"Good game but Bioware tried way too hard with the grinding and farming aspect. Certain quests like The one at the Winter Palace are ridiculous with the sacavenger hunts and ""timed mission"" aspects. The RNG loot drops makes exploits a welcomed time saver in this fetch quest simulator. 
Level requirement gear, tons of keys, shards and statues needed to open doors, a scavenger hunt quest needed to unlock your specialization skill, definitely ramps up the chore-farm boredom at an accelerated pace."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	"I've tried to play this game several times but as of yet it has not drawn me in enough to stick with it. There are little things that just really turn me off...for example...

When I want to interact with something (or someone) I have to be right next to it. In most games, if you want to interact with something you can click on it and your character will move to it.

When I stop to talk or interact with someone/something, my companions look like they drank too many energy drinks and cannot find a spot to settle. During dialogues it looks absurd for my companion's to nervously move around in and out of the camera view. Ok people, just chill! I'm trying to have a conversation here!

There are also several interface design choices I dislike. It seems quite console oriented and not defined for PC.

Inquisition? This name brings up two memories for me and neither is conducive to my wanting to be a part of this organization. First, I of course think of the Spanish Inquisition and their horrible reputation for torture, murder, etc. in the name of religion. Why would I want to be part of an organization called the ""Inquisition""?! The second memory that comes to mind is Monty Python and their spoof of the Spanish Inquisition (torturing people with a ""comfy pillow""!). "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	How would someone compare this to bloodborne? I'm trying to decide between the two
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/dragon-age-inquisition-review	@DS721 this definitely. I am a HUGE dark souls fan, but bloodborne was a big let down for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	"I've started playing Unity for two days now and I pretty much like it. It's visually awesome to watch and I love some newly added feature especially how now you are able to plan your own path to take down your target. Before, you were still able to go your own way but if you wished to reach full synchronization, you have to follow the script to the letter. 
Now it let you follow your instinct and it doesn't punish you if you choose another way around. I love this and I wish they'll keep that feature on for the next AC games. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	I am almost finishing the game now. A lot disappointed by controls of this game. This is the worst as far as I remember, graphically it is the best so far, but too much issues con control (probably the worst) some times you want to get inside a house and he climbs the door, i go kill 2 enemies at the same time he kills just one and call the attention of the other. Too many bugs like that kills the game enjoy-ability. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	I didn't understand the complaints for the controls at first. But now that I'm about 5 sequences into the game and many side quests done, I'm really starting to see it. There have been some really bad mechanicals moments that make me question how much longer I want to give this game a chance. Thankfully it's been out for awhile so I got it for dirt cheap.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	 so I know it didn't run well at all on consoles. but I just set up my new PC with GTX 1080 and can run this game 1080p 60 now and this is hands down my favorite AC. Mechanics wise, Syndicate is a step down in every aspect.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	"The games really good. Theres a lot of salty people in the comments for some reason, maybe they kept getting killed by a spy in tf2 or something, but salty people with bad opinions aside, the games very solid. It looks beautiful, has a great movement and parkour system ( it feels much more refined than previous ac games but at the same time is less responsive ) and the combat is very fun. The game has many avenues to approach different missions and has loads of content. 
If you forget about the overhyped marketing that every game gets nowadays and how glitchy it was at launch, take a step back, and look at it now, it's an amazing game and certainly a future classic"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	"I have to say firstly that whoever wrote the initial ""review"" has clearly either taken a bribe or some hardcore drugs to give it 7.8/10 because this game is horse shit. Probably 1 of the worst games I've ever played let alone in the AC series! Glitches glitches glitches everywhere. Ubisoft spent all their time trying to make it look good and don't get me wrong it does ""look"" incredible. But sadly that's where it ends. The ""free running"" is atrocious and never has a game made me want to smash my controller to little pieces more than this. The guy just wants to grab hold of fucking everything even a chair on the street. I mean come on when or how is that usefull?? The fighting module is terrible. Overwhelming enemies make it extremely difficult to fight and is very poorly engineered. Very clunky maneuvering and so unresponsive for about 65% of the time. Overall I would give this game 4/10. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME! "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	is the game still bad? i got it for free? shall i play it or would it disappoint?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	I'm a few hours in and so far I think it's great apart from some frame rate drops.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	"One of the best things about the AC series is the combat system, even when they changed it (slightly) in AC3 I was impressed that it was even more intuitive, I didn't think that was possible. Well Unity is where they absolutely ruined it, rendering it almost unplayable. 

Please someone tell me they fixed this in Syndicate."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	@ShotgunShawn combat is better in Syndicate but the story.... entirely forgettable 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	Too Buggy still...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/11/assassins-creed-unity-review	7.8 What a load of bollocks if Ubisoft actually made a fucking game without 100000 bugs and FPS of 2 the the game would be actually playable Ubi need to sack their game designers and hire some who know what they are fucking well doing
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	This is the best remaster collection I have ever played.  The Halo 2 remaster alone was worth the price tag.  Unbelievable job here on audio and video.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	@bpmike1983 Amen to that. I am just about to finish the Halo 2 Campaign and it is amazing and the cut scenes are stunning 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	So I heard this game was broken. I finally had a chance to play Halo 4 here in the MCC. I have a 5 year backlog of games, I know. I wish I had time to play more. But I finally got to it and thought that maybe the game had been fixed. Well, I played most of the way through the single player campaign and it was fine. Then right around the end of the game, I needed to pause it. When I got back to the game, I had a tiny screen and no sound. Had to reset the xbox one. Then it did it again a couple of times. Finally, right before the final meeting with the didact, I had to pause. When I came back to it, it did the same thing but after resetting, when I started again, it skipped the cutscene so basically, I missed the most important part of the game. It's embarrassing that a game is released to the public like this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	@Khaleesisdad Probably a screwup on your end.  No problems here except a text error on the last boss when trying to put a grenade in his mouth.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	@bpmike1983 @Khaleesisdad  um... no.  if you do a simple google search on this topic you will see that MCC has an issue when pausing the game that causes it to glitch. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	I like Ryan Mccaffrey, but he shouldn't be reviewing games unless it's a cold review. Ryan covered Halo:MCC too closely before launch of the game. When you're rubbing elbows with studio heads and getting exclusive access to the game ahead of time, it's a little more difficult to stay objective. Halo:MCC was a disaster out of the gate. Yet even after multiple days of a review in progress, Ryan still gave it a 9.0. The review seemed to be more based on what would eventually work rather than what worked when the game was reviewed. In the future, a game like this needs to be reviewed by someone who has been purposefully locked out of previews and visits by studio heads and programmers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	Almost a year to date and the game is still broken. I will not trust 343 with Halo 5. Why is this game rated at a 9 by IGN? It doesn't even work. The co op kicks you out when playing with friends. The multiplayer has no population. The multiplayer has been broken since day one. I know, I was there at midnight. I can't stay in the same party after a game and it doesn't even connect. If this game is a 9 on your site then all you reviews are a joke.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	The disturbing thing is the people that take it upon themselves to dehype and devalue the most absolute promising game of the generation. Ya'll like buying solitary remakes? They should have just taken the easy route and redid Halo 2, instead of taking the massive undertaking of all 4 games in the main series and working their asses off to keep their multiplayer intact running simultaneously? Amazing undertaking, package is sexy as hell, a few hickups on multiplayer having 4 entire games 4 completely different engines worth of queues running together is understandable. And it works perfectly now After a month it did, but people are still to this day in a frenzy doing their best to dehype and devalue it. Pathetic petty lame asses is what our community has become.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	this game flopped and is a failure
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	Should I get the MC Collection bundle or Assassin's Creed bundle? Never played either. My only experience with Halo is the multiplayer, didn't try out storymode.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/06/halo-the-master-chief-collection-review	"@FatboyFresh I would definitely go for Halo. I played both series, but I found AC to become too repetitive after about 2 games. Play AC: Brotherhood and Black flag, those are the best in the series.

Halo is a crazy interconnected journey from 1 through 4, AC doesn't have a great story, but it plays nicely.

Just my opinion!"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	Advance Warfare is a Dope game. About tired of Black Ops 3, so recently I've come back to playing this game. I missed it. I wish Infinite Warfare played like AW and not like BO3. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	"According to IGN:

Black Ops 3: 9.2
Advanced Warfare: 9.1
Battlefield 1: 9.0"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	Decent Campaign, shitty multiplayer. They royally fucked it up. The way that the guns, specifically the sniper rifles, lock on to people is terrible, as it means that losers can sit in the corner and just pull the trigger and win. Not only that, but the balancing was terrible. Whenever I use a LMG, and I get taken down by an SMG at long range or an Assualt Rifle when we both started firing at the same time, and I get multiple hit markers. Shitty balancing, shitty multiplayer, mediocre campaign. I really hope either sledgehammer makes a better game next time, or just stops. tbh, Call of Duty should just end, be a little more creative than adding some stupid exo-suits.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	This game was so bad it hurts to see that score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	These guys at IGN sold their souls for a fistful of grands. How sad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	I think if they turned this into a base building and resource gathering game people would still get ready to hate on it for not doing anything new. It looks to me like they put in very cool new mechanics that are integrated very well, yet it still has the COD gameplay. People dont know what they want. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	Cant believe this game got a 9.1 lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	Cannot wait for Black Ops III and Fallout 4 ratings.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	this game is rubbish, proly the worst shooter ever; almost any other shooter is better: wolfenstein, gta, max payne, army of two, gears of war, halo, destiny... not to mention strategic shooters like tom clancy's ghost recon, splinter cell, rainbow six or metal gear solid. this game is really brainwashing you, on purpose or not. not even as a FPS it doesnt let you play at your own pace, very linear, always going - do this, do that, follow that guy etc. it's absolute rubbish. i played it still cus i'm a maniac, but the game is crap. if you're not a fan or a hard core gamer, don't buy it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/11/03/call-of-duty-advanced-warfare-review	this isnt the worst but not the best honestly you can do better and it dosnt deserver a 9.1 review
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/28/nba-live-15-review	I've been tearing up the playoff challenges and weekly challenges in ultimate team mode. Being a true 90's kid, I love opening packs of cards. The game isn't perfect, but I've played it more than 2K this year. Way better soundtrack, too. 2K14 and 15 have awful soundtracks. This game is better than 2K in many ways.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	wow dude u hate this wonderful at the start thats stupid when i played this game i loved it instantly after i got done with the tutorial level which i have to say was kinda annoying but i had fun and ive already played it 3 times
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	"Had a fun time with this game. Wasn't that great at first impression, but after unlocking some more moves and learning how to make the most of the traversal mechanics, it became great. Had a lot of good humor, especially when it came to breaking the fourth wall and making fun of conventions in game design. Story was rather thin, but that was never the point of this game compared to the gameplay. 

Hopefully a sequel will happen one day, but from what I've read, this game didn't sell well. Got to admit, at a glance, I couldn't find much appeal in this game when it first released, it was because of great reviews and Insomniac's past work that I chose to get this game. Maybe it needed to be marketed differently. In any case, I'm happy I bought and played it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	This game was okay - but a 9? I ain't even mad, but this game is as shallow as it gets. Also lol at 30 hours.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	"Sure, kid. A huge open world with tons of hours of gameplay and challenges. But sure ""shallow"" you mad it wasn't on PS4"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	This was free to download last month and I still didn't get it. Too much jumping and grinding gimmicky shit.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	@deathmetalgod  the traversal isnt gimmicky at all, kind of takes a while to master
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	Just picked this up at Gamestop for $5. About to play if it would ever f'n install.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	That moment you realize you play better than the people in the review video.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	Damn good game. A sequel would be a day one purchase for me
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	This game is epic! So colorful and fun. I just finished it and all I can say is....WE NEED A SEQUEL.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	"Wow you people are so easy to please. Let's just a pixel move on the screen and have it jump and slide. It's just a video game! :)


No wonder so much crap sells nowadays!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	"@niva_dragon Worst comment 2016 has another worthy contender. By your logic every platformer ever pretty much is awful. And it sounds like you don't even know what ""a pixel"" is.  One character model is not a single pixel."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/27/sunset-overdrive-review	ok then I'll pass!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-legend-of-korra-the-game-review	note, i am a fan of Korra and TLA, but for $10-$15 try this game for yourself don't judge based on this review;  this is the most fun i have had with an avatar game.  The combo system is simple and you can button mash, but if you actually try the combos it looks cool.  Probending is fun, and the extreme difficulty makes for a decent challenge.  For the money, this is a good game in my opinion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-legend-of-korra-the-game-review	@aferran thanks for this post. i was wondering if it was good or not and i'm interested in it. TLA and LOK are the 2 shows i constantly find myself watching over and over. i really hate it when these ign reviewers put a game down cause it's not Arkham City or Shadow of Mordur or whatever lol again thanks for this post. i'll try it out!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-legend-of-korra-the-game-review	A damn good game for 10$, yes I said it. A damn good game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-legend-of-korra-the-game-review	played this game from beginning to end, had a command response (the main part of that little thing called GAMEPLAY that SHOULD be what 75% of the game is reviewed on) of 0.02% which is a frigging joke to be honest, this failure to comply to the simplest of controls (which to be honest is all of the commands in the game) included 250 presses of counter at the EXACT same timing just to get 3 or 4  against the giant robots.  Aso I might add that whoever says they pulled off the bayanetta vibe is copletely off this gme visually is ok the gameplay just seriously sucks, and to be frank a 4 year old could've done a better job on the gameplay
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/the-legend-of-korra-the-game-review	I can't believe I had IGN fool me this time. I just played this game It's awesome game. It captured the Baynetta vibe and the dodge/counter/clash mode is one of the best. For a $10 PSN game, this is better than most many games. The author of this article might have played too many hack and slash without realizing what he got into.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/fantasia-music-evolved-review	Harmonix has done MUCH better with Kinect than Rare.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/21/fantasia-music-evolved-review	I actually might get this game. Just tried out a demo and its good. Also might get that FRU game too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	 Man IGN, make sure this reviewer reviews the second next month. She gets survival horror and will give TEW2 the treatment it will likely deserve. Great review!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	"This game was abysmally bad. Easily the worst I've ever played. Story...what story? You just randomly teleport to different cliche horror environments. Random recycled zombies everywhere, and are never explained. Random notes are picked up, and you'd think they are clues to the story, but no, they have nothing to do with anything. It starts out as a survival sneak around game, and quickly devolves into a clunky over the shoulder shooter with the worst controls ever. This game is so bad I'd wager that anyone giving it good marks is either a member of Bethesda's marketing team, or has a crush on Mikami. The characters have less personality than wet cardboard. There are NO payoffs to literally anything in this game. The two sub bosses who keep reappearing (safe-head guy and The Ring ripoff girl) you would think, at some point, would have some explanation. Nope. None here. The combat AI is wretched. You can just run past pretty much anything. Cheesy zombies that look like extras from The Purge in clown masks with GUNS. WHY DO THE ZOMBIES HAVE GUNS. Which doesn't help them much because they just walk/shamble straight to you while firing like stormtroopers before the give up shooting. Oh, and you only get a small handful of weapons, which is kind of ridiculous because you cant pick up and guns the zombies drop (submachine guns etc) Melee is punching, even though your character uses a bowie knife for stealth kills. What? The dialogue is awful. The voice acting is cringeworthy. the nurse in the save point zone (where you have to endure a screeching nails on chalkboard sound EVERY TIME YOU GO THERE) never has anything to say. Ever. Nothing. Its like the writers got together and said ""you know what, what if we make a horror themed game with no story or motivation for the player?"" The ending was weak, but then again I didnt expect much after slogging through this snooze fest."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	@kengokenny Your troll is so lazy you should feel bad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	"I really enjoyed this game.  A lot. This is a freshening take on survival horror that is reminiscent of the Resident Evil 4 or the two original Dead Space. There are flaws indeed, like sometime very bad checkpoints and weird, changing difficulties. Also I am glad the letterbox can now be removed (It did bother me). It probably was added in a patch.
I made a funny video showing all the important moments, funny bits and bugs I encountered in my 25 hours playthrough. All this with added comments, music and special effects! Juste be wary of **SPOILERS**
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d9xy1BUsXtQ&t=3s"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	It was great ... this game deserves 10 rating 😍
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	Finally got around to beating this game on Halloween. Great game and I hope they make a second one. The story was messy but the gameplay, music and atmosphere were all perfect! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	All you need to know, Evil Within has Resident Evil 4 action with Resident Evil 2 ammo scarcity. Game simultaneously wants you to avoid fights while throwing waves of enemies at you. Has some creepy parts, but overall very underwhelming. More of a 5/10 than a 8.7/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	Great game. Bought it for 13€ and it was money well spent. It follows the lines of Resident evil 4. If you are into action/adventure/horror game, this is a must have and it's cheap.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	im guess im writing this to any potential buyers of the game, just so you get an insight into the opinion of somebody who wasn't at all phased by the game, also im very bored. The evil within i found to be everything i hoped it wouldn't be. The characters are a huge flaw for me, so boring and cliche. Particularly Ruvic, the main boss, who looks like a zombie emo character from assassins creed, not remotely scary or challenging. i feel like the plot was also very cliche, though sometimes confusing it was easy to work out what the end of the game would be. The Game really lacks in real horror, and the survival elements are fairly hard but take so much away from the horror situation. The zombie ghouls, just an irritating obstacle with no originality that act as a buffer between each boss. Some of the bosses themselves are ok, but for the most part they too were cliche's with little scare factor. its a survival game with a twist that in my opinion really lacks the fear and tension it promises. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	"I've lived and played all the trully original games of the survival horror style, and i really feel sad about this game... everything is so beautiful yet experienced players have already seen it: police investigating a massacre (parasite eve feels), protagonist being carried out on a gurney, can't kill monster that is a butcher of some sort (sh2 all the way without the atmosphere)...
Pretty often i'd rather suicide to recover a wasted bullet or just because i was bored with my character...
This game isn't immersive, i couldn't care less about anything about it. Just my opinion...
Edit: After attempting to finish the playthough I gotta say that this is a fine game.
If you manage to push through the initial boredom, it is quite immersive. You see bits of silent hill here and there, yes, but it is quite a ride. Facing the boss of chapter 10 without no bullets whatsoever trying to scavenge away my victory was an experience i only had with the demons/dark souls series.
If you love survival horror and is tired to get only empty promisses, get this game. :)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	"@nachtwandler89 I think this takes explains why so many people give up on this game before giving it a proper chance. Unlike other modern games you need to push past first stage and get to ""The patient"" before the games settles. The stealth is very optional later on and the game is far more similar to Resi 4 with a twist of Dark Souls and a sprinkling of Silent Hill. 
The story is poor, but then Resi 4 has a very poor story even if it is more memorable. Like the games it is inspired by it won't be everyone's cup of tea but for the right people it clicks and loved. Also if you are in the camp that thinks games do too much hand holding and the trend of open world game play is a little overdone then you may appreciate what The evil within has to offer. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/the-evil-within-review	An underrated gem at it's finest.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	Procuro jogador para jogar o modo multiplayer, meu nick Ganondorf26
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	"So, just finished this game. Wow. Bought it on the low-low. Wasn't expecting anything amazing but wanted to give it a whirl. Totally got sucked in. Listen, it's not ""mind-blowing"" but what it is doing is reinventing the wheel when it comes to SRPGs in a much different way than what Disgaea or Agarest or any of those other games are trying to do. If you like Dark Souls level of combat difficulty and LOVE SRPGs then you owe it to yourself to give it a try. I'd give it a solid 7.5-8.0. The story is meh at best but the combat has so many meaty layers and there's a plethera of combat abilities, ways to approach combat and so many in-betweens that I'm not quite sure how the reviewer actually approached their review. 
 I'm thinking the reviewer tried to tackle it in the same vein as a FF Tactics game or similar and was doing everything wrong. You can NOT approach this game like that. You must clear your head and basically learn a different way and then sit back and watch the beauty of the game reveal itself. It is quite good and I was very much surprised at how many layers there were to discover. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	"Personally, I'm a big fan of Dark Souls and even I didn't even liked the game. The game was just a mess of unexplained mechanics and not to mention the game was slow and unforgiving. I especially hated the final boss, in which the fight is way more different than any other fights. The story, character designs and graphics are terrible, and the main characters just doesn't have enough backstory for me to care enough. The multiplayer is also a bit of a letdown, not to mention that not a lot of people are playing online.
At best, is a recommendable Strategy JRPG for the hardcorest strategy gamers with a lot of patience. At worst, is an unforgiving, ugly and slow JRPG, that it is basically the worst JRPG on the PS4 (and yes, even worse than Omega Quintet, Star Ocean 5 and the SAO games). For you, is a 7.5-8. For me, is a 4/10. It has some neat ideas but due to budget constraints, they failed to deliver the ""Dark Souls of Strategy JRPGS"". And I doubt the developer would even consider making a sequel due to the mediocre reviews it got, and not to mention it bombed hard in Japan."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	I just saw this game in the PS store, and it looked amazing, both aesthetically and game play wise for that matter. Then I saw a bunch of negative reviews giving it low scores. So i looked on here, and decided to watch the review video, I kept waiting for him to start talking negatives, and he never really did. He brought up a few things I could see lowering the score by about 2.8, but from how it sounded, it didn't seem like a 2.8 out of 10 game. It sounded like maybe at least an 8/10 rated game. So I am just confused about the points here. Anyways, have a wonderful day! :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	"That's a bit like saying that you gave Sword Art Online Lost Song a 10/10, when you read IGN's review on it, you would say ""The reviewer sounded as if she was giving the game a 10/10...just like me :D""."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	What I mean is Sony needs to pull it together the PS4 may be the best selling system but soon people will realize it has nothing. I own a ps3 and I think LBP is still a good game besides it flaws. I may come off as a wii u fanboy but I am not, I state the facts. I feel wii u has the best exclusives with xbox one at number 2. I wish Sony would give the Ps4 a must have title. Capcom will be the reason I will eventually get a Ps4 because of SF5 being a Sony exclusive. I will be getting an xbox one for the next tomb raider and lara croft game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	I guess you missed Bloodborne being released.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	"""soon people will realize""

If anything you said held truth, people would've realized it by now. The PS4 has been out for almost 2 years now."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	I see his point, Sony is not throwing awesome games at us every month like it was back in PS1/PS2 era. I miss those times too, but I understand things are slower nowadays if you want some decent quality, given development complexity. PS4 is still young hardware, and PS3 itself took more than a couple of years to achieve wonders.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	PS4 isn't as good as PS3, power aside. You can play online for free with ps3 and they still are getting the same titles. Until Street Fighter 5 is released for PS4 looks like PS4 owners will be getting the shaft. Xbox One has Forza 5 and H2 as well as halo, wii u has mario 3d, new super mario u, wonderful 101, DK freeze, sonic lost world, hyrule warriors, mario kart 8, nes remix, and many more exclusives.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	Thank god the PS4 finally managed to reach to the top, having way better games than before like Bloodborne, Uncharted, Amnesia, Persona, Nioh, Horizon, Wipeout, Tales of Berseria, Until Dawn, Salt&Sanctuary, Planetside 2, Yakuza, etc.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	what wii u game has scored that low? Sounds like your a bitter sony fanboy trying drag down the wii u. Wii U still has A+ exclusives, I have yet to see any on ps4. I bought a ps4 and took back once I realized the PS3 has the same games a free online play. Until Street Fighter 5 comes out the PS4 isn't a must have. This game looks boring as hell.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/16/natural-doctrine-review	"I have never understood why people are saying the PS4 has nothing. I own all 3 of those systems myself, Wii U and PS4 since launch, X1 I got a year late. I was actually playing a few different things on my PS4 just before getting on here to see this review, and have my PS4 on right now. If it truly had nothing, I would have stopped playing the PS4 shortly after getting it, and here I am still playing it to this day. That just doesn't equate to nothing to me. Wii U is definitely amazing, and I agree not only does it have the best exclusives, though that is more opinion, it has the most exclusives. I would love the X1 to pick up the pace though. I keep hearing about all these cool features for the X1, then keep getting disappointed about how they turn out. Anyways, have a wonderful day! :)
Btw, as a side note, if you are referring to ""Rise of the Tomb Raider,"" did you hear that it is going to get a PS4 and PC release, just later?"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	When I bought Bayonetta 2, I really wanted to beat Bayonetta 1 since I never completed it on Xbox 360. I remember enjoying it so much on Xbox 360 and on Wii U it was the same experience. I completed the first game on Wii U and the cool thing is Bayonetta 2 picks up right where the first game left off. This is a must have for Wii U owners. But let me say it's not a kid's game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	I really need to pick this up at some point
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	Just finally getting around to playing this before Super Mario Maker hits, and I'm blown away. The visuals, the style, the combat, and the stuff to unlock along the way...just an awesome game. I loved the first Bayo, but this improves over the 1st in every possible way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	Played this game for the first and it is fantastic. The combat feels and flows really good. This game has perfectly utilized some QTE with the climax and torture/punish attacks. The character of Bayonetta is also very interesting. She's witty and sassy. My favorite part of the game is the enemy design. The angels look absolutely beautiful and so are the demons. I'm really glad I got this with my Wii U purchase.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	So, I feel bad for Sony. I wonder how many death threats and petitions to bring Shenmue 3 on other consoles they will receive.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	@Agt_Pendergast Now you know how much backlash there was when Bayonetta 2 got accounced for Wii U only.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	How is it a Nintendo fanboy thing? The first also got high praise when it was on 360 & PS3? There's a ton of depth to the combat, if you feel like you can get away with just frentic button mashing, up the difficulty and go for the trophies.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	I was never interested in this game. But when I turned 17, and was finally able to download the demo, I tried it and loved it! Now I'm going through the first one because I had never played it before.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	Bought this and played it last night. I was severely underwhelmed. The graphics are downright bad. This is no better than last gen graphic wise.The dialogue isn't funny, it's annoying and cliche'. Gratuitous violence and sexuality (not that there's anything wrong with it) are used as a crutch. Combat is basically frenetic button mashing. The story is contrived. I just don't get the high review scores. I'm now convinced fellow Nintendo fanboys are completely blind to this game because it's an exclusive. I dunno, maybe I just don't like Platinum, there's too much going on to appreciate any gameplay mechanics or animation. I felt the same about TW101. I hope I can sell it fast and recoup my expense.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	"@jrob23  The first game received review scores just as high, so there goes your little ""fanboy"" theory."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	You're the only one...I would definitely have a check with another disc and then your WiiU
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	"I just bought this and man it's awesome, but somewhat difficult. The normal difficulty level is more like hard, so there's a reason this game doesn't let you start past normal as a new player. Bosses and enemies can literally take half your health, and enemies can do the same if not dodged constantly. The only thing I don't like about this game is the camera. and the reviewer mentions it, but imo it's bad enough to subtract two points. The right joystick moves the camera so wonky and slow that it's pretty much useless. 8/10 for me. 9/10 if the camera wasn't as bad as Ninja Gaiden's.
But on that note I cannot wait to beat this game normal and start the sequel right away."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/13/bayonetta-2-review	@bpmike1983 It's the same camera controls as other fun classics like Devil May Cry, God of War, and Dante's Inferno.

After the rising stars game, I was drafted 22nd by the Grizzlies, was signed to a 2 year rookie deal, and began as part of the rotation.  I didn't go undrafted and go through 10 day contracts as is said to be part of the storyline.  I have signed with Jordan brand in my rookie year, and I don't have any negotiations with an agent or anything.  Is there something wrong with my game?

I really like 2k14 but it seems like people who did don't like this, and I don't like a shot meter or long load times. If anyone could give me some advice here that would be great
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/09/nba-2k15-review	It's/was on sale because 2K16 comes out next month. Wait for that

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/09/nba-2k15-review	Improved mycareer mode LOL IGN is more clueless than the 2k15 devs. This game is grade A trash coded to make you play horrible and try to scam you into spending more money on VC coins. Officialy done with 2k15 after this joke of a game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review	Why is the rating below GTA? Just a notch below GTA for not being able to create a car and wear really cool clothes.  However besides that, the action is much better, the voice acting is better, the story is better, the gameplay is better and it's FUN AS F$*#.  The crazy asian ascents are the best part.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review	Sleeping Dogs is one of the best action/open world games I've ever played!!! Good story, great combat, some funny characters in it and most of all you can just kick some ass over and over. Sleeping dogs has a better hand to hand combat system then GTA just a fun game!!! It's too bad we may not see a sequel to this game because it is the most fun fighting game I've ever played and I have played a lot of games in my life!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review	"I got this free on the XB360 a couple years ago and could never get into it. NOW, I got the Definitive Xbox One edition free, so I'm giving it another shot. Not sure where all the positive reviews are coming from on Sleeping Dogs, this game is clunky as heck, the driving is horrid and it plays like an early PS2 title. No innovative features, just standard fare, copied-n-pasted from superior game developers.
I've played almost every open-world game since 2001 and Sleeping Dogs is one of the FEW games I would rank UNDER Saints Row. I just don't get the praise.
There's not a lot of freedom in the game, you feel really confined by the scripted footchases and cheesy environmental traps.

I'm going to try to power through the story, but I'm not having fun yet."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review	"@SweatyHamWallet so you hated the first game. so 2 years later you re-download the game you got for free 2 years back. so what did you expect some sort of 3-d futuristic game. you knew what to expect, did you think the game magically changed with enhanced graphics was going to all of a sudden blow you away? and you are shocked that  you are struggling to "" blow"" thru the story, when you hated the first game. what did you really expect bro?virtual reality"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review	"@thegamer78 @SweatyHamWallet  Actually just finished the game qame couple days ago.......and I learned to love it! The story itself was the best part, and I became a martial arts master by the end of the game. I was still a little frustrated with the driving and wonky camera angles, but overall, I'd give it an 8/10.


And I am sorry that I originally placed this game below Saints Row, That was wrong and I am ashamed of my ignorant assessment."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/08/sleeping-dogs-definitive-edition-review	@totalj For me Sleeping Dogs is a much better game.  Everything about the game is fun and well done.  Murdered was very short, kinda boring and had frustrating controls

That's what this review was paid for to create, for those who keep asking how you can review what is basically a tool (which can be done anyways, but where are the Unity, UE, etc. reviews?)
EXPOSURE = interest = sales
Granted this isn't quite as bad as a regular old game getting exposure just to boost sales. This has the side-benefit of possibly piqueing others' interest in creating games, but I'm sure Microsoft saw that possibility as $$$ from the get-go also, which is why this is so ""refined and user-friendly""

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	Its not bad it could be alot better though, good news evolution studio's has been purchased by codemasters. Im looking forward to seeing were the game goes now & will now be on xbox one as well as pc. Peace !
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	"Great arcade racer, one of the best arcade blasts on any console. 
-after the patch, that is!
only negative issue is that to win the hardest races, you really have to buy better cars from PSN store. Bit of a cash in there. But apart from that, I recommend this to everybody."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	I played this for about an hour and was like...it's okay. Never played it again and that was a few months back. Played Forza 6 for the first time four days ago, I haven't put the controller down. I respect the game, but it is no where near as good a racer as Forza.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	@craizedwayz But does Forza allow arcade-like racing?  If it doesn't, then there's a reason why DriveClub would be more accessible for other racers out there.  But I was impressed with the demo of Forza 6.  ^_^ 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	@GreyLightning @craizedwayz Well, kind of. You can take all the car and cosmetic damage off, but it doesn't really have an arcade mode. Honestly, I was intimidated to buy it because I'm good at arcade like racers. But it was off impulse. I was slippin and sliding all over the place for the first hour but once I got the hang of the controls, I'm burning up the track like I did in Need for speed. Now I drive with most of the assists turned off. I don't know what it was about this game, but I just couldn't dig it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	I loved the game, I had no problem with the content and cars
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	This review should totally be rewritten. It's obvious their not even talking about the same game in here. I played the game first time during last two weeks. First downloaded the PSN Plus free version, the we decided to buy it right away. I've been a fan of Gran Turismo, NFS and Forza as well. And Driveclub for sure has shown the best driving experience compared to all of them, the way you enter the car and you're able to look around while you're racing, the way car interacts with the racing tracks, for the first time car wrecks sound and feel more realistic, also the painting scratches and car damage look much more realistic. Cars handle totally differently from each other and they feel far from glued to the ground. Weather is very beautiful, dynamic and much more realistic. There's so much improvement to realism here. For example, always hated the way car crashes sound in Gran Turismo and also the way tires screech persistently during all curves, it was never realistic. Just watch any onboard cameras in any racing sport as comparison, at Driveclub all of this improved a lot. Game is dynamic, realistic, innovative and exciting. This is a 9/10 game for sure.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	Is every update patch for this game 10gb? No wonder why I ran out of internet last month.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	I loved this game a lot. But honestly I loved only because no other good racing game on ps4 is availbe right now. I wish this came out earlier though. I would recommend this game to anyone especially that there is a huge free version available for ps4 plus subscribers. Mostly. It lacks any kind of customization and this huge. They should add some dlc that enable customization. What I can say about it is that it is a great game for people who are waiting for the next GT game. It feels like a mini GT game looks great controls great but lacks the huge fleet of cars we are used to have. Plus the challenge mode is amazing but this works better over time once you became a hardcore player. Most of the challenges are pretty hard because people create them for public and there are million others who would be there ranking on top 10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	The only people who hate on this game are fools who haven't actually played it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	@Fanboys_Are_Tools_3 the only people who LIKE this game are brain dead idiots who CANT discern something better and fools who are tools
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	This game is for real racers not people who want to customize cars with shiny wheels! Graphics hands down far superior than any other racer. You have to play it to appreciate the amount of detail in this game. Reviews for DriveClub have been just ok which is surprising after playing it. Judge for yourself. Forza is a great racer but if you do a side by side comparison to DriveClub Forza is boarder line embarrassing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	"@JohnB2000 Forza blows this pos out of the water with ONE car and the graphics in driveclub are just sad, the sound and physics are totally wrecked and your statement that DC is for ""real racers"" is just proof at how out of touch you are. Forza is a SIM where this is SUPPOSED to be arcade but like everything else about this game it FAILS even that in an epic way. There is NOTHING real about the way this game feels, looks, drives or sounds"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/07/driveclub-review	Drive Club is not even in the same category as Forza. And to even say that Drive Club is a realistic racing sim is a joke. It's obvious you never played Forza. That advertises itself as a racing Sim. Drive club is advertised as a racing arcade game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	This is one of the best games ever made. After the introduction of the Alien, it becomes really really tense. Yes, it's a bit repetitive, but it's an amazing game. 5.9/10 = a shame. This game is at least 8/10. With all the shooting crap on the market nowadays, this game deserves way better than this review. In fact, this game is so good, it deserves to be a classic. The developers did an amazing job, but the game didn't sell enough, cause only 17.7% finished the game and left the game after the 3rd chapter. The first chapters (before the introduction of the alien) are pretty boring, but then you're up to a ride like never before. It has that uniqueness. you can still buy and play this game in 2017! It still is one of the best games ever made. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Finally playing thia game. 12 hours in and I'm loving it. Tense as hell. Cant wait to play the dlc later. Wish this was getting a 4k enhancement.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Played it, beat it, on PS3 when it first came out... Just picked it up on the ps4 for dirt cheap. This game was amazing. No complaints about the AI over here. In fact, I loved the way the xeno has this animalistic sense to it. You always feel as though you are being stocked, and the way it responds to your movements keeps you on your toes with suspense and tension. Very unique cat and mouse experience. Coming from a huge fan of the movies and the survival horror genre I gotta say this review is wack. I'd give Alien Isolation a solid 8! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	"Normally IGN and I tend to agree when it comes to games being matched for my playstyle, but this review is totally out to lunch. The AI it claims is frustrating is the whole reason this game is terrifying... you're never safe. Ever. No matter how long you wait for the Alien to leave, it'll be back in a few short seconds, always looking for you. You literally have time to scamper from one bed to another, and that's it.

Plus, it tells you dozens of times in the menus and loading screens... don't run when the Alien is around. It WILL hear you, it WILL kill you, and it's entirely YOUR fault because you can't follow simple directions. If the reviewer finds being punished for their mistakes frustrating in the face of those directions, that's not the game's fault.

As for pacing, I've never had a horror game terrify me from start to finish like this one did. Normally about the halfway hump I have enough weapons and ammo, or am comfortable with the predictable monster patterns, and know I'm relatively safe unless I do something stupid. (I'm writing this while in the steam overlay playing Outlast, btw, and the exact same thing is happening here). Not so with Alien. 

In short, this review is basically a retread of TV Tropes' ""It's hard therefore it Sucks!"", and I would advise anyone reading this to discount its opinion. Take your time, keep your ears and eyes open, and proceed with caution. If you get killed, it's your fault. Oh, and that sequence of killing androids without the Alien? It's pretty much the only time you'll deplete your ammo stocks if you're playing the game right, so it's a nice opportunity to lull yourself into a sense of security before easily THE. MOST. TERRIFYING. SECTION. EVER."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	"Surely IGN are supposed to hire reviewers who are competent gamers? 

I've just completed the game in around half of the time this review suggests, on hard difficulty. I imagine the gameplay is likely to seem overly tedious if you are having to repeat the same actions over and over due to constanty dying however this doesn't happen if you are playing correctly? 

This was one of the most refreshing games I've played in a long time, the review seems to ignore stunning graphics and sound and terrific A.I.

I completely appreciate criticism of pacing and moments of repetition although it seems I was less less cynical about these flaws as I played by the games rules. 

Don't run to a save point, the Alien will hear you and stab you, you will get used to death and the horror magic will go, this is obvious.
IGN hire a better gamer to review games?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Funny i'm back because of Splatoon 2 Review just posted last night. I asked an editor if the game could get a re-review and the reply was only if the game had new content that changed gameplay...Really? A game needs to have more content and change gameplay to get a re-review when everyone here knows the initial review was unfair? I'm not saying it's a masterpiece but im saying we have almost 30k coments here and most will tell you the same thing, the review was unfair, so IGN please it can even take weeks but just re-review this, if you come to the same conclusion then fine we'll take it but at least give it a chance. I've seen people smashing the game because of difficulty when A) this is a true survival game, B) the alien really is a very smart and deadly creature and the game does it beautifully and C) hidding and waiting and having the motion tracker up all the time isnt how you play, they are momentary solutions, you dont sit and wait for the alien to leave you can use lures and throw them to create a moment to escape. There's no hand holding here...Talk about backtracking, yeah RE is all about backtracking in the early games i dont hear you complaining about that, be fair, be equal towards all games, this review wasnt fair and thats why you have almost 30k comments where most everyone is telling you how unfair you were with the review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	@MGSfan99 AMEN
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	@MGSfan99 Completely agree, the reviewer seems to blame the game mechanics on his lack of ability? 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Ended up back here thanks to the news about sequels to Alien Covenant. I couldn't disagree more about the score of this game - it is one of my favorite games, ever. The scares, the hunt, the scope - it was fantastic. Replayability is perhaps it's only flaw, but games like Alien Isolation (and Last of Us, etc...) suffer from that problem. Doesn't mean they aren't great games. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Most terrible review I've read in years. This game is possibly the best survival I've ever played.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Seriously, you are upset with the fact that the AI is too smart? Are you serious?! Besides, you probably didn't even play the game properly and still give it a rating of 5,9. This just shows that this review is crap and total garbage. And by looking at some of the comments below, yes, you are a bad reviewer anyway.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	fire Ryan. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	This game should GOTY edition
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	"I just came to post my first comment in over a year because this seems to me the worst review on IGN I've seen in fifteen years.

The game is easily one of the 5 best games made for PS4, easy.
I played it in the hardest difficulty and didn't find it frustrating, it's just that the reviewer is very bad at infiltration and doesn't have patience. I found the pacing pretty great actually, and so did several other gamers I know... and we've playing lots and lots of games for over two decades.
If someone is hesitating because of this review, don't. The game requires some patience, it's true, but if for example you like to play MGS without getting spotted, it's not worse, it's actually easier once you understand how the Alien moves. The sound design, which is excellent, helps a lot and playing in a quit environment is primordial : if you can't hear what's happening around you, you'll die."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Great game! I agree in part with the review, the game loses focus at times and can be frustrating when it really didn't need to be. The mechanics used throughout weren't broken, so why chuck something else that doesn't work in. But the many things they did get right make this an awesome game. A must for any Alien fan! Im looking forward to getting into the DLC.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	"I just had to slide over here and post.
After buying and playing the game after the controversial release reviews ON THIS SITE, I conclude...



It's freaking amazing. A true classic of our modern era that every self-respecting gamer needs to have in their library. Go buy it.


Game of the Year for me, and I LOATHE survival horror games. Sodats-sayinsumpin!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review	Ryan should have swallowed his pride and lowered the difficulty because the game isn't hard or frustrating, he just sucks at it. He's a terrible reviewer anyway.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/01/skylanders-trap-team-review	@twn2zach because that sounds horribly boring and painful. i own an n64, but good gosh banjo kazooy was a meh game at best. and lets face it, whith graphics getting better, your eyes wont be ruined looking at an old n64 game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	"I reckon Chuck got this one spot-on in the review. Too many of the cases are solved on what feels like unsatisfactory evidence rather than solid proof. There's also a serious hiccup in the Kew Gardens case, where the accomplice could've been one of two people. The actual miscreant had already been given a cast-iron alibi, which had been accepted by Sherlock Holmes and not referenced in the end sequence at all. And I agree the lack of an overall story arc is a problem in a game that's sold as a single unit and not an episodic release.

On the plus side, the visuals are excellent, the voice acting spot on and some of the cases really do make you feel like Sherlock as you piece together the clues, but overall, I'd make sure you get it from the bargain shelves."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	"I'd disagree with the reviewer's judgement that the evidence is largely circumstantial and that there are multiple plausible suspects for the crimes. Acquiring every piece of evidence will prove beyond a reasonable doubt who the guilty party is every time, except for maybe 1 case, which I would say the evidence still points to one person
For instance, the one with the sailor's knot, a rope was cut by a tall person, and the victim killed by a very forceful blow. The sailor was the only suspect to fit all those parameters.
There was only 1 case that I got wrong, and that was because I made an assumption, and because the game basically deceived me. (Holmes made an assumption himself that was wrong and influenced my verdict incorrectly, really irked me)
The other criticisms I would agree with. This was a fun detective game that was a little too easy, with no great overarching story."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	"Had to stop and review this. It's excellent, got it as a free download for Xbox Gold March 2016. I went into it nonchalant because it was free, I had seen a review last year and thought it might be cool but never bought it. 

It's a nontraditional style and at first felt very awkward and unpromising. But by the second case you quickly appreciate the way the gameplay works.

This game is seriously just a big mystery with lots of puzzles. The character doesn't get hurt or have a health meter, and before you solve the case you can peek to see if you want to go back and change anything. It's really a no-lose, win-win situation and you can just have fun solving mysteries.

At first it felt limiting that you couldn't walk around anywhere, it's not a free roam game, you don't even jump anywhere. But as the map begins to expand and you have to go back and forth to places to pick up clues and verify evidence, you are grateful that you can fast travel from anywhere and your world suddenly feels bigger.

It's fun to find clues and see how they fit together, it's a great thinking game. It's worth the price of free all day, and I would have been glad to buy it as well. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	I agree massively
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	Just started the game up after finishing Far Cry Primal since it's free on Xbox One. I am really liking it so far, and I am very surprised at how nice the visuals are.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	I loved this!  Truly great game, especially for Sherlock Holmes fans.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	I'll try it out since it is free with gold.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	Game looks like it sucks. Not for me. Even with free GWG.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/30/sherlock-holmes-crimes-and-punishments-review	"I agree that new modern Sherlock is amazing.
However I refuse to let that stop me from enjoying the classic more true-to-form Sherlock as is presenting in the game."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	"Boring piece of crap. The whole game is one type of mission just recycled with a different orc captains name for the story line and about 3 types of other missions (upgrade weapons, free slaves, collect doodad's) for the side missions.

Disappointing considering the reviewer gave this a 9.3. He must really like doing the same stupid things over and over in his games.

I don't!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	Picked this one up in the sales ahead of the Shadow of War release. For a Lord of the Rings/Hobbit fan it's certainly a must-play. However if you've next to no interest in the series' lore it can get quite boring and monotonous. If just mindlessly killing Uruks is your thing then this game certainly caters for that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	"7.5/10
Good game that gets much, much better in the second half of the game. The whole game constantly introduces new game mechanics to you which keep things fresh. If only the first part of the game was shorter as it was a complete inferior experience to the second. May have a been a better game at its time when the fight-system was fresher and graphics were relatively great. The lore is placed in between Lord of the Rings and Hobbit apparently so that would be cool if i were a fan of either of those series :/ 

I would say pick this up if you're just looking for a game to play and definitely wait for a sale."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	GOTY edition for five bucks and I agree with the rating.  Great fun, for a great value.  I wish Dynasty Warriors was more like this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	@stingerlegends worth the money definitely but not a Must-Play
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	"I don't know about everyone else but I'm tired of seeing 25+ games come out that are just the same game code, AI, world etc that has been just re-skinned and re-storied. Someone somewhere is making bank because they wrote the base code for all recent games like this. (For the past 4+years) 
I first noticed this with City of Heroes. That code was used to make at least 8 other games."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	Finally got the game and about 14 hours in, honestly, I'm barely into the campaign and so far, yeah that 9.3 is high. So far, if I were to be honest, it's a 6. It's repetitive and honestly, the open world focus means that I'm pretty much doing anything but playing the campaign. I'm literally playing the campaign out of boredom after I slaughter a few captains...well...more like running away when there's 3 or 4 at a time. Took me a while to figure out I can run to the nearest bomb, but that's my fault. Perhaps after I force myself to stick with the campaign my feeling for the game will go up. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	Here's my honest year and half late review of Shadow of Mordor @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/pc/late-middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	I have to say the old PS2 Lord of the Rings is hands down the best version of the movie in game form.  The soundtrack and game play makes you feel you're actually there.  However, this one's not bad.  A little repetitive but it's fun if you're fan of LoR.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	"I am sick and tired of reviewers giving game high marks, when they have only played the game for a couple of hours (most a couple of minutes), the Animations in the middle of battle rely pisses me of, and the placement of audio sounds in the game, sounds like they are right behind you when in fact they are bloody hundreds of yards away.
No reviewer worth his payroll should never review a game until he has finished it, there are a lot of bugs in this game that they just don't come across, because they come home from getting pissed and give a review all out of perception."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	He does mention that he played the game for over 25 hours...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	"@Yourfavcolombian this game is OVER RATED, don't get me wrong I like playing this game but hell it is not worth the score they have given it,I must have played this game for hundreds of hours, and personally would give it around a 6 out of 10.

This game is fun to play but the amount of bugs that don't even get a mention is ridiculous

All I can say, the DEVS must have paid for this review."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review	If you're giving this game a bad review because of graphics you need to learn to correctly enjoy video games. I still play my super nintendo
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/forza-horizon-2-review	Just picked this up for $20 and its really, really good. I used to like need for speed games for comparison and I think the driving and drifting in this is far better and feels (at least) more realistic. Would recommend this game to anyone, even if you aren't a racing fan its absolutely gorgeous.

I have have never seen such unbalance in a football game, defending is horrible, the tackle button is useless, you just run Into the offense, it makes it sooooo easy for the COM to expose you. Attacking is just luck at higher COM difficulties since your team A.I. can't make 1 Decent run. 79 rated defenders can catch Neymar in 2 seconds, the referees are always calling you out giving the COM free kicks, the COM can always get away with dirty tackles, my shots go 50 metres away from the goal, the stupid COM again can take away possession with ease because the programmers set their A.I to a point were they NEVER make a mistake.
I can't take you seriously EA, you better fix this in FIFA 16

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/fifa-15-ps4xbox-one-review	The animations is good but this game in terms of game play is terrible.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/fifa-15-ps4xbox-one-review	Exactly. Extremely disappointed in paying $60 for the digital version when this came out so I couldn't even give it back. Fifa 15 is the worst I've played in the past 5 iterations. I keep hoping for big changes to the gameplay/AI but this game is literally unplayable for me. I can't play on anything above pro and I used to play on the highest difficulty in 13. The way the CPU plays is so frustrating and it's like you never have control over the game. Even when I play Real Madrid against the average teams in La Liga, I still feel no advantage. It's sad really because I like how they've made the gameplay smoother in some ways. Dribbling is a lot more lifelike. But just so many stupid problems in this game. For instance the few times I played online matches, people were ripping 40 yard goals like they were nothing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/fifa-15-ps4xbox-one-review	HUGE bug! When playing player career, the game does not allow you to play in ANY international tournaments. Friendlies, yes.

Would grab this game if it's a bit cheaper, already found a good site to get it for around 15,- https://www.g2a.com/r/buyfifa1... Gameplay was always a lot of fun on fifa games. The commentary was somehow a bit annoying sometimes, maybe because everthing was repeated to often XD However more modern fifa titles are of course more 'realistic' in those things.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/fifa-15-ps4xbox-one-review	"8.3 Except, you know, the game not understanding you have to interfere with play to be offside. Or Strikers not making runs when you're on a counter attack so your defensive midfielder is 30yards ahead of your striker by himself. Or If you're on the halfway line, even if there's only 1 defender between you and goal, it's impossible you're on an attack. Or being able to pull shirts as a legitimate way to stop players out running you unless they hold on too long and your player collapses due to it. Or off the ball fouls causing players to do back flips are ok. Or both your defenders running into each other and collapsing leaving a striker to stroll at your goal.
Yeah, 8.3..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/23/fifa-15-ps4xbox-one-review	Oh, and the player changing sometimes doesn't work, and when it does it'll regularly take 2 attempts to get the player you want. But that's been in Fifa for how long with no desire to fix it?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/19/disney-infinity-20-marvel-super-heroes-review	My girlfriend and I just picked this up and we have had a lot of fun with this since we also enjoyed playing skylanders trap team. For us they're something new and different from the norm of games we usually play. They are relaxing and enjoyable playing as characters we love. We are picking up Star Wars Sage 3.0 and all the Star Wars characters, which put the itch for another Star Wars Force Unleashed game to be released. Hell they will probably do a remaster given the track record of this generations thus far.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/19/disney-infinity-20-marvel-super-heroes-review	This game is a ton of fun. People seem to forget that you don't have to have a deep storyline, intense action, or advanced graphics to have a game that is fun on a basic level. That, and bashing anything Disney seems to be very popular these days. Do yourself a favor, go to a store that has a demo of it set up, and at least spend a few minutes with it before writing it off completely.

Coop imo is super fun even if there's a drop in resolution & units density. Nothing like finally being able to play with someone without a splitscreen (something I've hated forever).
Only feature lacking is obviously online multiplayer, duels, etc.

And the defence are snipers with pixel perfect acurracy so they score in OT, the goalies warp to make stupid saves, the opponent A.I is smart but its unfair when yours is chasing you while you're trying to cover a guy, and they score, and lastly the ref (I hate that guy) gives away powerplays like candy and when the computer slashes your stick out of your hand, elbows, interferes, our checks the stupid goaltender its okay.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	NHL 15: In a nutshell
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	"I am a hardcore hockey fan. I absolutely love hockey, but I absolutlely hate this game. I've been playing since Nhl 13 and i've played until my thumb was injured for months. Speaking of injuries, let me start there. I hate the gameplay so much, i'd prefer to simulate my entire Gm Mode if my team didn't have injuries pretty much every other game. Rookie is too easy, Pro is easy enough, so I like All-star, except, when I try to pass the puck, it automatically magnets to the opposition in the middle of the ice, even when I aim (deliberately) down the boards. The ""overall/ratings"" system is garbage. I'll be coming down the ice full speed and ready to knock someone off thier boots and if i'm playing a better team than mines, my players will just skid right past them, maybe give em a little booty bump on the way, the game litterally forces me to miss the hit even with my best hitters! Collision detection is horrible.Not to mention about half the time I do collide with someone, they have enough time to get back up and grab the puck again or they just take it from me with the same guy i layed the hit on. If you don't have HDMI, the game completely lags and is unbelievably unplayable. The guy who does the player ratings has to absolutely be retarded as most players strengths are not highlighted. Rather, this guy, or guys, are hell bent on who should have a higher overall. It's easily noticable. Matt Read and Couturier are the Flyers best defensive forwards yet their defensive ratings do not stand out (at all) from the rest of the team. Nearly all the starting forwards have minor differences in any of their skills, it's just unbearable to look at! Vinny Lecavlier easily has the hardest slap shot the flyers forward unit but without looking, i bet Giroux was given the hardest slapshot because they wanted to keep his overall around 90. Make sense? So I bet to keep an overall rating high, guys like crosby can hit harder than the guys who gave em his concussions! lol This game disgusts me in so many different ways, like my passes not going to the right players often.... and so much more. Mind you, i can still win games on allstar!!! i've just played it so much, i'm used to all of it's repetivie bullshit tricks and what used to seem like random gameplay to me has turned into redundant, rigged bullshit. If they don't give this game a full makeover next yr, I absolutely will not touch it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	This is what kills me about sports games debuting on next gen consoles from last gen; they leave out a bunch of features and then reintroduce them one or two at a time as new in the next years game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	That's EA for you. They do this all the time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	Thanks for all the comments. I was thinking about getting this game, but I almost only play seasons offline and it seems to be cumbersome to go through the Be A GM mode to do that. I sad that both the FIFA and NHL series seems to be stripped down to force us to play the Ultimate Team modes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	"All the haters forget that hockey is played how this game runs. It's fine big deal if you don't have all the game modes they will come in time. Let them fix this and the polished product will be far superior game. Remember almost every"" next gen"" game has been broken so far.....relax and play some puck boys!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	You can play some puck just not with your boys. There's no EASHL.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	Playing against the computer at the All-Star level is infuriating. The number of times I managed to poke check the offensive player on a 1-on-1 and he still keeps the puck and scores on a F&*&*(&*?ing wrister is out of this world. Not to mention that slow CPU defenders somehow manage to have a burst of speed to thump you into the boards or bodycheck you into outer-space while cutting towards the middle of the ice is somewhat frustrating (i.e. coming down the right wing with Jeff Skinner defended by Tyler Myers. He's about 6 feet away but still, in one skate stroke, he blasts you up in the 30th row of seats). Plus, even though you shoot the puck 20 times in the first period without scoring, the CPU is going to have one rush down the ice and score on their first shot on net. Why? Because your goalie is a paraplegic. Oh and lastly (I'm going to stop after that because there would be a lot more to say), about two times a game, one of my players is going to chase a player a hundred freaking feet away from the puck only to push him and get called for interference. Sadly it's my only option for hockey right now and switching to a lower difficulty is just gonna let me score 8 goals per game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	"It's called ""scripting"" and it's ruined FIFA too. People need to stop buying EA Sports games until they sort this crap out."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	So the question is, is the OTP & EASHL modes in past gen version of this game? If so, screw it, I'll buy it for that & wait for hopeful improvements in NHL 16
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	I've been playin this for a bit and most of the time I have fun. The only thing I have an issue with, especially in GM mode, is how the computer will decide to take over and win. No matter how well you play on defense, it doesn't matter. Maybe I'm alone in this thought. It's just weird.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	"You're not the only one, the rubber banding is totally outright ridiculous. I'm leading 3-1 going into the 3rd period, a couple minutes in, they score so it's 3-2. I held them off until there was like 3 minutes to go in the game and bam, score and score, all of a sudden, it's 4-3 for them. I hate how they can shoot a wrister from anywhere and it go can go in, I can pull wristers all game and nothing.

Good game, I enjoy it cause I like hockey but I seriously hope NHL 16 is much improved from this dumb rubber banding."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	Lets bring back the International Tournament and Memorial Cup and not make a huge ice tilt!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/09/nhl-15-review	"I am a hardcore hockey fan. I absolutely love hockey, but I absolutlely hate this game. I've been playing since Nhl 13 and i've played until my thumb was injured for months. Speaking of injuries, let me start there. I hate the gameplay so much, i'd prefer to simulate my entire Gm Mode if my team didn't have injuries pretty much every other game. Rookie is too easy, Pro is easy enough, so I like All-star, except, when I try to pass the puck, it automatically magnets to the opposition in the middle of the ice, even when I aim (deliberately) down the boards. The ""overall/ratings"" system is garbage. I'll be coming down the ice full speed and ready to knock someone off thier boots and if i'm playing a better team than mines, my players will just skid right past them, maybe give em a little booty bump on the way, the game litterally forces me to miss the hit even with my best hitters! Collision detection is horrible.Not to mention about half the time I do collide with someone, they have enough time to get back up and grab the puck again or they just take it from me with the same guy i layed the hit on. If you don't have HDMI, the game completely lags and is unbelievably unplayable. The guy who does the player ratings has to absolutely be retarded as most players strengths are not highlighted. Rather, this guy, or guys, are hell bent on who should have a higher overall. It's easily noticable. Matt Read and Couturier are the Flyers best defensive forwards yet their defensive ratings do not stand out (at all) from the rest of the team. Nearly all the starting forwards have minor differences in any of their skills, it's just unbearable to look at! Vinny Lecavlier easily has the hardest slap shot the flyers forward unit but without looking, i bet Giroux was given the hardest slapshot because they wanted to keep his overall around 90. Make sense? So I bet to keep an overall rating high, guys like crosby can hit harder than the guys who gave em his concussions! lol This game disgusts me in so many different ways, like my passes not going to the right players often.... and so much more. Mind you, i can still win games on allstar!!! i've just played it so much, i'm used to all of it's repetivie bullshit tricks and what used to seem like random gameplay to me has turned into redundant, rigged bullshit.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Lol that was funny +1 to you sir.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	I can't believe that this big-ass game has taken the world by storm in only few years...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Never gave this game a chance because of how it looked. I finally did and can't put it down.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Never gave this game a chance because of how it looked. I finally did and can't put it down.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Like the game but the graphics are still weird for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Bought Minecraft on the PS3. Got a code that gave me digital versions on the Vita and PS3(!) and the PS4 version was discounted to $5 until 3/31/17. Cool game...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	All I know is, I love this game. Truth be told its easily worthy of a tryout from anyone. I asked my girlfriend a dozen times to try the game out with me. But she kept saying it looked stupid and childish. Well I annoyed her enough and she finally tried it. Well, do they have a methadone for Minecraft addiction? She absolutely loves it and the game is twenty times better when you have someone to work towards a goal with. I have played it since early alpha on pc. But I find its a lot easier to get someone into the ps4 version. Because its a bit more steam lined in the crafting department. So I guess if you are one of those haters that goes omg its got kiddy graphics and looks silly. Just go ahead and try it anyway because I almost guarantee unless you are an alien you'll enjoy it. Think of it as a complex lego simulator with rpg elements.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Why the actual fuck is this a 9.7 when the normal Minecraft is a 9?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	"What is this ""normal"" version you're talking about? If you're talking about the PC version, that's because it was reviewed years ago before all the extra content was added. This 9.7/10 reflects how much the game has changed since then."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Then update the pc
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	They should update all of their reviews, really. There are tons of games that have been greatly improved with free updates over the years and, sadly, IGN's review scores are anachronistic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	No, the PS4 and Xbox One version is much later updated. And some of the things he liked the most, such as the Crafting Tutorial and multiplayer with lobbys doesn't exist in the PC version.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	It probably got a better review because it's much more user friendly and more accessible to more people. I own all versions including Android. And I have to say it's much easier to play with friends and other people on a console. But modding the PC is fun too but can be challenging or awkward.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Mods are easy. You download a file, click run, then drop the mod into a folder. Bam it works. Or use a mod launcher, you only have to click one button for hundreds of mods.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	It give me nausea and a massive headaches just watching the video. I cannot play the game without that happening badly. Only a couple other games have this terrible effect on me. So far, texture packs, FOV changes, nothing helps.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	youre too old sir try peggle 2 i heard that was what my mom plays
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	9.7? Absurd, simply absurd.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Agreed. Should've been 10/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	yeah sure, a game with nothing in it a 10...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	"If you think Minecraft is ""a game with nothing in it"", then you've either never played it (nor read anything about it, including the review above), or you're just a weird troll. The game has everything in it: a perfect in-game physics system that allows you to build anything and completely terraform a world, monsters to slay, resources and items to collect, optional tasks to complete, dragons to slaughter, 23 different biomes to explore, PvP or cooperative multiplayer, and the like. This ""game with nothing in it"" has more in it than almost any game I've ever played."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	"The ""game"" is for 10 year olds. If you like it that much, you're either 10 or should have it looked at."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Wrong. It's a game for everyone. It's popular from 5-year-old to 65-year-olds. It's the 3rd-best-selling video game of all time. Saying it's only for kids when the majority of people who own it and play it are adults (go watch some Twitch streaming of the game), many of who are incredibly smart computer programmers, is a naïve thing to say.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	I like this game :s
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	No, only adults that play it say so, the game is specifically developed for children.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Most kids do.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Im not a kid lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	"The game was originally developed by Notch because he wanted to make an isometric 3D building game with RPG elements in the vein of Dwarf Fortress, Dungeon Keeper, and Infiniminer. Explain to me how that indicates to you that it was ""specifically developed for children""?
Kids cannot figure out the complex physics system in Minecraft that has led people to make insanely complex automatic farms, traps, and so forth with redstone. Yet, kids can still play the game, eschew those complexities, and completely enjoy it.
The fact that it appeals to everyone from 5-year-old boys, to 13-year-old girls, to their casual game-playing parents, all the way to hardcore gamers and dilettante computer programmers and modders is a testament to how perfect of a game Notch made.
Regardless, say it was developed for children (which it wasn't). So what? So is every Pixar movie yet they're fun for everyone to watch. A great game (or movie or book and so forth) is a great game. Period. Minecraft is a great game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	Then you should get it looked at if you like a game made for kids that much. Do you still play with toys? No? Well, there you go.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	ash5454 just got burned! I would love to see what you have to say to all this outstanding evidence! You must be a emo teenager who thinks anything that isn't black or angsty is for kids.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/05/minecraft-ps4-and-xbox-one-review	"""all this outstanding evidence!""
Evidence of what exactly? That some guy wants to excuse the fact that he plays a child's game by trying to convince others that it's complex?
Next thing you guys will say is that Monopoly isn't made for children because it explores the intricacies of world economics, demand and supply and human greed.
Give me a break, it's a pixeled game with no story or basis where people build things with different colored squares. That some
people build cool things? Sure, there are mods out there that can do incredible things with any game on the market. That the game is complex? BS.
The fact that some adults play with it, does not make it for adults."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	one of the most overrated games I have ever played................. every time I play it i feel it empty
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	i played this game on xbox 360 when it first came out. then i got a PS4 and it looked alot better. the only thing is that i couldnt cross platform transfer my profile so i had to start all over. the game has its up and downs. But what game doesnt, the gfx are good and the game play got better with updates. if you enjoy looting and grinding like a mad man then you should like this game. i have soloed most of this game and kept up with the people that team up. so for solo players in might take alittle longer, but as your playing youll run across a fellow solo player and most of the time team up and get those levels that are alittle harder.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	"I grabbed this game when it first came out, played it with a friend until lvl 15 or so, and then put it aside until a few weeks ago. I put it aside mainly because I was really just confused by the game and didn't think the loot system was very good. I also felt that you weren't really rewarded for exploration so it all just felt kinda of schizophrenic to me. 
So, a few months ago I picked it up again as some friends of mine recently bought copies. I really have to say I am having a total blast with it. I really think that the ‘shooting’ aspect of the game is second to none. I am lvl 17 and am now seeing that loot is more interesting. And the world design has really set in too. It really is amazingly detailed. Funny thing is, I have been playing this mostly alone, and it is just as enjoyable.
In conclusion, although I didn’t care much for the game on launch, I do now see that if you dig a little deeper and put some time in, the game becomes much much better. So I do understand some of the hate. In today’s age of instant gratification and reward, if something isn’t enjoyable or rewarding in the first 5 minutes, it ‘sucks’. I so admit I too am like this with games and movies sometimes. So I totally get it.
I imagine when I finish the main campaign, I will buy the Taken King as the reviews for it have been excellent. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	@rickfett Yeah, the game got a lot of hate, and deserved a little more credit than what it was given. I stopped playing a while ago but put a lot of time into it. I must say that the raid (Hall of Glass) was incredible. I stopped playing before the other raids came out, but HoG with a full party was maybe the most exhilarating moment of my relatively long gaming life. Very challenging as well.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	@Andfx8 @rickfett The raid is called Vault of Glass or VoG.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	@talon1974 LOL yeah clearly it's been a while
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	@rickfett I had a similar experience to your back in September 2014.  I got Destiny on launch day and played for a few days until I hit level 20.  I didn't play it again until December 2014 when a friend mentioned he had bought the game.  It was a completely different experience playing with other people and I still play often almost 2 years later.  It's a good game, it just took Bungie a little while to get some pieces in place with the expansions.  They still have a lot of work to do though for Destiny 2.  A lot of players love Destiny and have put more hours into it than any other console game, but there are high expectations for Destiny 2 and I don't think the patience will last as long as it did before.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	The game isn't the best or bad it's got it's pros and cons. The pvp needs a lot of work bc it's garbage. the lag is bad ppl not taking damage is getting old And the crappy rewards are annoying. And the 3 of coins are a joke one week you get a descent amount of exotics then the next week your lucky to get one or off 40 3 of coins give me a break. Sorry but the graphics and story line aren't enough to help this game I rate it a 5. And for those who hate on destiny haters u must be kids or work for bungie bc this game starts off good and ends up as garbage
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	@Schneidewind78 Destiny is in my top 5 console games of all time on Xbox One and PS4... I'm neither a kid nor an employee of Bungie.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	None of this crap can beat good old Star Wars Battlefront.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	Just got this game the other day. Pretty much got level 25 straight away, not sure why. Not too sure what I'm doing. Not the easiest game to get to grips with. But I'm enjoying it, I think the more hours u put in this game the better it'll get.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	@Stubbsy84 did you buy the taken king? It's gives you an item that skips you to level 25.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	@Stubbsy84 After a few missions the speaker gives you an item that jumps your character to 25.  I'm pretty sure that is what happened to you.  If you start a second or third character, you won't see the same thing happen.  And Spicy_Ketchup is right, it's a perk of the Taken King edition.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	Levels 2-19 make no difference in MP. And I've never heard of grims. Been a gamer since 75 huh, I'd expect constructive criticism from somebody that old. Not the ramblings of a whiny 12 year old. Maybe start reading books and work on maturing you old ass loser.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	A year later the game is still going strong with a growing strong despite the shit destiny haters.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	You took the words right out of my mouth lol. This guy most likely has not participated in end game content and instead is just one more of the Destiny haters that just scratched the surface and really does not know what they are talking about. Phaselinear, if you are going 1-23 it is also partly your fault for not pulling your own weight. By the way, unless you were playing Iron Banner or Trials of Osiris (which i highly doubt) character levels do not take part in the damage calculation or anything during Crucible modes.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review	Nothing like halo
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	Just started playing...and damn! The hype is real! This game is pretty awesome!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	Man this game is balls hard. I've perfected missions 1-33 but I'm like 20 seconds off a perfect for 34! I just don't understand how it can be done!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	This honestly looks like a shitty runner game that belongs on the iphone. But I see there are some people here that like that kind of stuff. Keep drinking that kool-aid.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	You obviously haven't played it, so why are you commenting on the people who have and enjoyed it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	i like games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	I like games too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	Just goes to show you that excellent core gameplay will beat flashy visuals every time.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	But this does have flashy visuals. The art style is great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	This game doesn't have excellent core gameplay IMHO. It's a clunky game at best. Stopped playing it half-way. I can't complain since I got it for free via PSN, but people will be disapointed if they play it after reading such a bombastic review, The review video only covered the initial levels. When you get to more complex levels the game just isn't any fun, Too many gates to disable and the jarring decision to add a teleportation device that forces you to stand in place if you want to use it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	This game is fantastic. Even the gate levels move fluidly and it's extremely rewarding to get that perfect run.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	I've been alternating between ps4 and vita on this game, it's utterly fantastic, I've been moaning about the lack of aaa on plus this year but I would have to class this as on a par with any aaa title in terms of fun.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	Where it's easier to play?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	It feels great on the vita, feels like a better fit, but once you get it on a bigger screen...it's a tough choice. Both are very responsive
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	Long live ps+ excellent service great free game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	Have you played txk yet? It's so good!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	I'll give it a go buddy... Been playing destiny and hotline miami.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	The controllers are confusing so I stopped :/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	"I think this game does some things right others not right this guy on this review messed up a lower score was needed it should have made it a lot better than they have it now. Here is what I am talking about it takes old school shooter type levels with no enemies at all on both platform and shooting levels.
The way this game should have been made is combining overhead shooting levels like Blazing Lazers / Axelay / Super Star Soldier / Side scrolling shooting levels like R-Type / Thunder Force III & IV / Gaiares the platform levels should be like Mega Man and Metroid.
This is just my ideas on making a good game way better it is trying to be like old school games works in some just no enemies messes it up just an opinion from an older gamer is all."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	I played farther into it better then I thought no enemies at first till your a ways into the game. I found that strange I guess to get people used to playing it older shooting games did not do that you had to be ready to play right away. And if they make another try doing that not learn how to play slowly makes the game not as good in my mind decent though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	I wish the game had 47 levels. Because the twin ship game mechanics introduced in the final 3 levels is atrocious and ruins the momentum of the game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/02/velocity-2x-review	I'm completely addicted to this! And thanks to it, I'm a lot more aware of my Vita's buttons since I never felt this much secure about pressing its button in the way the game has to be played at a frenetic velocity!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	"I got First Light first through PS Plus and so far I think it's better than Second Son. I haven't finished SS yet, but the story is so much better. Fetch feels like an actual person in contrast to Delson who is trying to save people we have seen for like 5 seconds. 

Yes, you only get Neon powers, but most powers in SS do the same anyway.  Lightspeed run is actually fast now (still not close to light speed, but faster that the subsonic speed in SS).

It's fun and has a good story."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	I loved Delsin and actually didn't like Fetch nearly as much.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	Yeah, First Light and Second Son actually have next to no connection to Infamous 1 & 2.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	"It's a great game, full stop.
We need omits AAA titled DLCs for $15, those of us with jobs and commitments can no longer afford to invest 15-20 hours in a game, and don't want to lose overall game quality as a result of that."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	"''Infamous: First Light is a decent story around a better character than Second Son''
No characters are better than Cole and Delsin. Your just a bunch of main characters haters IGN."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	@Wesker_XIX Cole was great, but I thought Delsin was meh. Not nearly as likeable. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	I got it for free, but it would've been worth the money! It's awesome! Great story and great action! The only bad thing is that the town was DUP free at the beginning so it felt a little less lifeless than Second Son, but that makes sense since it's a DLC. Overall, it's AWESOME!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	"I just picked up a ps4 again recently after having one at launch and selling it becuase I wasn't using it much.
This was the first game I played on it and I thought it was much better than second son, which I felt was a meandering train wreck of a game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	What a crappy game, good thing it was free. SUCKer punch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	I really liked it, unlike Second Son, there actually was a Sucker Punch narrative in there
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	"To complain that you only get one of the powers that ""Second Son"" had is like complaining that you miss the electricity power from the original ""Infamous"".
Second son and First light are not comparable because its not like First Light is a DLC, its a standalone PSN title. Yes they exist in the same universe but they are two different games. You can't be mad that Altair only had 1 hidden blade in assassins creed but ezio had 2.
My point is, his criticism is invalid."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/26/infamous-first-light-review	"I agree. I also tried out an endgame save of Second Son at a friend's, where I tried everything (except the concrete powers) to see if the game warranted a buy. You only get a bit of visual variety and slight changes to mobility. It's all the same moves with slightly different visual flairs. I wasn't impressed by that ""variety"" of Second Son but I did enjoy First Light - it ended before I could get bored."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	Someone fire the two idiots in the video review. Three minutes in and nothing but mindless babbling. And then still little actual review content shortly thereafter. IGN should request user reviews of this game as a contest. They get much better content these two got paid to do.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	i got this on sale through steam and after for many years playing the tiger woods games for a long time this game hammers it hands down.Yes it's tough but having played golf i know how tough it is mentally and thats just for fun so just imagine how hard it is for pros i like the online side that i can play against mates elsewhere but it is a good feeling when you drill that shot and it sticks but yes it's a steep learning curve.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	Thumbs down. Very disappointing! On a my Windows 8.1 Pro x64 box the game keeps crashing. In July support suggested back leveling nVidia video drivers because they're working on the problem. It's October and the problem still isn't fixed. Tech savvy folks, if you're having a similar issue in win 8.1 x64 check the key value for HKCU\Software\HB Studios Multimedia Ltd.\The Golf Club\Handicapindex_h2158052195 it likely reads (invalid DWORD (32-Bit) value). TGC has more bugs than a baitshop!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	This is the best golf simulator out there. The putting SUCKS, I don't care what the developers say. And fix the graphics, they are primitive.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	"I'll be honest with you, I got The Golf Club on release day, and I am still playing it all of these months later. Sure, it lacks some features in other golf games. But where it shines is that it offers so many free courses to play. The course creator is also cross-platform, so if you design a course on the Xbox One, your friend on the PC or PS4 will still be able to play it. Designing a course is easy, too. Anyone can ""design"" a generic course . . but by using the simple-to-use tools, you can design an impressive course from scratch. The only real problem with user-created courses is that you're always going to have a really awful course ""designed"" by some kid with no concept of course design. But there's in-game course ratings and web sites that will point you toward the better courses. (One last thing. The game itself takes up very little space on your hard drive, and the courses are not stored on your hard drive. Loading a course can take a couple of minutes sometimes, but it's a small price to pay for the space you save on your hard drive)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	"""No progression"" is generous for a negative point. How about ""pointless?"" Maybe ""No objectives?"" I have never seen such a beautiful game in terms of graphics be such a suck-fest in terms of playability. To say that ""golfers"" would appreciate it more is nonsense. I play nearly 100 days of golf a year, and this game still sucks. Putting is a pain in the butt, and it feels like a Groundhog Day version of a game . . . just keep doing the same thing over and over and over . . ."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	Can anyone vouch for the update on 10/20? States that performance is upped 10-20% and a load of features were added: http://thegolfclubgame.com/201...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	"Having player Tiger Woods games for years the difficulty of The Golf Club came as a bit of a shock! However, it is so much more satisfying when you do a great shot. When you're at the driving range and you hit that perfect drive? Yeah, it's like that.
Putting is really tough, no previews and it's actually quite tricky to see the hole. Still, I'm a fan."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/25/the-golf-club-review	Being a big fan of the old links game on pc from years ago I found this really good' I did like PGA and building the character up but personally I liké golf sims to be exactly that, everyone on same level get better with practice no frills, not for everyone but if your into the real thing you may enjoy this a lot just as I do, mouse controls are rubbish so better with a pad to be fair
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/21/madden-nfl-15-review	"Dear Madden/Xbox One people,
I am a four time cancer survivor who will no doubt be fighting the disease again soon. All I do is play Madden, whether I'm healthy or not. I only use the Tampa Bay Buccaneers when I play. Arguably one of the worst teams on the game. However, on the Xbox 360, I was always ranked in the top 5-10% of the country, even though I only took the Bucs when I would play online.
I dreamt of the day I could play my favorite game on a new Xbox One system, but because I'm always sick, money for extra things was always very slim. On this fourth bout with cancer, my community threw a fundraiser for me. Finally, I had enough money to buy an Xbox One and the Madden game to go with it.
I had played over 500 games online with the 360, check the stats (Gamertag: YoutubeBigSix8). I just KNEW that the graphics, moves, jukes, EVERYTHING were going to be better on the Xbox One. I spent A LOT of money for just this one game, and BOY was I disappointed!
You really took a step back going from the 360 to the One. The movements are just like the old Madden games without the new engine. On the 360, (playing Madden 15) I can work magic with the RB Doug Martin. On the Xbox One, it's like running with an overweight fullback. He has the exact same roster numbers, but the movements are NOTHING similar to the 360 version. It's terrible. I thought maybe I just needed to get used to the new system. I've played over 50 games online with the Xbox One and I am now CONVINCED that the game lost SO much in the system upgrade it's ridiculous.
I find myself preferring to go back to the 360 simply due to the fact that I can move SO much better than on the new Xbox One. I would seriously like my money back because my favorite game is terrible on the new system. Unfortunately, my cancer surviving son has grown fond of his Mortal Kombat game and now the Xbox One has to stay. I really hope that you put just a LITTLE MORE EFFORT into making Madden 16. You had FINALLY got the running right! It was great! Then I get the amazing Xbox One, and it's like you went back in time. Please fix this on Madden 16. The Buccaneers are FINALLY getting a decent QB, and I would really like the mechanics engine to take a step forward versus the SERIOUS step back it took in the system upgrade. I'll end with this: Had I known the game Madden 15 on the Xbox One was going to be this much worse than Madden 15 is on the Xbox 360, I would have NEVER made the serious investment in the Xbox One. Right now, I'm feeling as if I should have purchased a PlayStation.
Hoping for better days,
Ethan Birch

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	7 dollars on xbox right now. Summer Sale ending soon. I picked it up because of the up coming sequel next year. Never played these game but they look fun. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	"@Legend_of_Link27 Absolutely amazing game, Last Light is even better. It's second to none for atmosphere.

Exodus is going to be insane on Xbox X"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	G2A £7 for 2033 + last light
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	Better bargain than Fallout 4, more entertaining too. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	$6 on XBL right now, figured maybe it's time to check it out now
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	Picked up this double pack Redux collection for £8 on PSN at the weekend and loving it so far. Never played them before, but 2033 is dripping with atmosphere, a lot of fun to play, too. Definitely worth the price I got them for.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	"Just finished the Metro 2033 Redux and I have to say it was a very enjoyable game.
I have the original version but never finished it due to how frustrating it was with some gameplay and glitches.  Almost everything that was frustrating in the original has been fixed in the redux version.

There are still a few annoying level design issue that make it hard to figure out what to do next but other than that I loved this game.

8.5/10 for me.  Looking forward to starting last light now."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	found this game really slow to start with on chapter 4 and it's starting to pick up...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	Game is $19.99 on Amazon right now. These games look kinda iffy to me. Think I'll wait til it hits the sweet spot of $9.99 on Gamefly. I can wait with the backlog I have already.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	@gmfco311 They have a sale on PSN. Saints Row 4, Gat out of Hell, and Metro Redux for $16. I missed out on Saints Row 4 and never played the first Metro, definitely worth the money.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	@gmfco311 if you are still interested it on the xbox store for gold members for 6 dollars

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	hahaah Ive been playing metro last light on my buddies ps3 and I was interested in seeing what the second one was gonna be about and found out Im playing it.... o well guess I didn't need to play the first after all right? lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	wtf????
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/metro-redux-review	WTF indeed
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Really fun game. My only problem was the vita's looooong load times. OTher than that, really nice game. Thanks Ps Plus.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	This game was alot of fun. I was wish the stealth aspect was programmed a little better and the controls felt off. But overall I had a good experience and like the fact that the difficulty was random so playing levels over and over will give you a different challenge. It's not great, but it was okay for the 4 hours it took me to beat it. Got it free off the PSN, can't complain!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	The sloppy controls and inconsistent AI all but made the game unplayable for me. Sometimes you enter a room and everyone suddenly notices you. Sometimes you enter a room and no one will ever notice you. Sometimes you're shooting at someone and they simply cannot die. You're supposed to be able to throw grenades back at people but it never works. You go up and down ladders even when you don't want to. You get stuck on pull up bars , sometimes unable to stop the up/down up/down cycle of nonsense... all of these lead to very frustrating and incredibly awkward moments.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Maybe something is wrong with your controller or PS 4, as I've experienced none of the issues you mention. The game is a lot of fun, has a great art style, and is an 8/10 for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	"I have to agree, for a game that seems to be about sneaking it has very poorly implemented stealth mechanics.
And the controls. I just want to move the analogue stick up and down, why do I have to move it out to the very edge of the thing before it will register I'm trying to aim at something?
Another thing is the combat can be very bad. I got a game over because I ended up in a room with enemies beside me and also in the background, and any cover point only hid me from the enemies in the background. That was an example of some terrible games design."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Beat the game in one sitting. Fun, but Smeekish.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Great game! I've played for 3h, but I had to quit because I'm near the end but I cannot go forward because I don't have enough cash to buy ammo... Sucks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Just picked it up for free on PS+. It is very addictive but sometimes I feel like the game wants you to get in a fire fight when what you really want to do is be stealthy the whole time. I also wish that taking a officer hostage wouldn't screw up your stealth adder.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Yeah it sucks
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Just got this game off of PS Plus. I really like it so far but I do agree with the review that going into cover and AI are a bit finicky
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Spy vs Spy ..did they make a game out of that yet?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Yeah, quite a while ago actually. I played it on the original xbox. Super fun game actually, excellent multiplayer, both online and splitscreen (especially the latter actually). I'd bet you can find it for a couple bucks somewhere.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	I think he was being sarcastic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	Really? I didn't. :/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/19/counterspy-review	My review/preview still raw. The controls I can do, but what is the Al ??
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	Amazing game still playing today
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	Go play Path of Exile instead it offers SO much more in every aspect (oh and its 100% free to play the full game and content with free full expansion packs) OK, so i will condense this down. long time Diablo fan, loved Diablo and D2 and D2 medianxl mod, played it for years. Eagerly awaited Diablo 3 release bought it straight away, played through with 2 characters then fell back in my chair with dispair. This game sucks, this is NOT diablo. Its now a kiddie click fest hack n slash with no build skill/attribute diversity that is not even an ARPG?. Somehow they've manage to butcher a very good pre-existing storyline into a shallow, weak and repetitive one. Half the stats seem irrelevant to your character (you cant allocate them anyway?) Each character is identical and weapon type is stupidly irrelevant too (My wizard is running around with a 2H axe dealing more damage then wands and staffs o_O ). Blizzard you should not have made this shallow, weak and pathetic game that i and many others feel was a cash grab at the Diablo fans wallets. even thought its too late don't buy this game, go play Path of Exile instead or any other game for that matter!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	Funny how it scored higher than the original 2 Diablo games.. IGN must have drastically lowered their standers or be extremely desperate for advertising
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	"I've never played any of Diablo games, but I'm planning to buy Diablo III. Do you recommend me to get the game with the expansion? Also, is Co op actually necesary to enjoy the game? 

I played Path of Exile and loved it, but being more of a casual player I think I'll enjoy D3 more. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	It just looks like a tarted up top down scroller? What's the point of this on a PS4; isn't it a bit dated? Amazed at the 9.2 score.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	$19.99 at Gamestop(new) and Best Buy(used) too..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	You can get it for less than $20 right now on PSN

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	If this game is the best way to experience Diablo lll... Why did it score lower?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	@LSKYWALKER It scored higher.  He scored this a 9.0 on PS3 and scored this release as a 9.2.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/14/diablo-3-reaper-of-souls-ultimate-evil-edition-review	@splurge1015 @LSKYWALKER I presume he meant that Diablo 3 got 9.5 originally, now the ultimate edition gets a 9.2.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/12/hohokum-review	"A Freudian analysis reveals that the sperm represents your ego and the various inhabitants are the Other.


So the game is about, uhm, coming to terms with the Other(s) through release of the ego.


This is pretty much the point of any hallucinogenic drug, releasing the ego. We can see that reflected in the art design as well. So i think we're pretty close with this analysis."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/28/the-last-of-us-remastered-review	my favorite game of all time
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/28/the-last-of-us-remastered-review	"The game excellent. The story phenomenal. The game did something that no other game has for me and that is it tugged at me emotionally. Naughty Dog excells at giving games a cinematic feel. And I look forward to that in their future games ..... But ....
This game does not deserve the 10 it was given. While the game is great, it is far from perfect.
Trudging cross country with Joel and Ellie was an experience. We watched the 2 grow from 2 people who just met brought together by a mission to pretty much save humanity. But as the story unfolded, their relationship changed. We experienced their ups and downs on an emotional roller coaster ride, but that roller coaster derailed a few times along the way.
While playing this game, I couldnt help but keep thinking, where are they storing the food for the trip? Better yet, where are they getting the food? And where the hell is Joel and Ellie getting the batteries for their flashlight? Batteries only have a shelf life of a few years, yet there was never a concern about sparing the batteries in the flashlights. Hell, I think I played my whole last playthrough with the damned thing on.
And then there is the issue where you walk into a warehouse with 10 scoundrels looking for you. You are doing your best to sneak by and kill them without making a sound. But while you are sneaking around watching your prey ... Bam, Ellie runs by the guy and pretty much bumps into him and the thug pretends as if he didnt notice the teenaged girl with a gun in her hand run by him. So there were huge issues with AI on both sides."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	"Bought this game a couple of months ago and I'm still addicted! The amount of things to do is just amazing. Coming from a big One Piece fan I see so many things from the anime/manga that make me smile. From comments or words that characters say to fighting enimies in all the different islands. 
This is without doubt THE best One Piece game I have ever played.
I'm playing it on PS3 if you were wondering. I don't know how the 3DS version is."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	HOW DO I GET THIS GAME?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	"if you haven't already got it...don't
you're better off playing the pirate warriors series.
it has a ton more characters, each character has more than 3 moves, the stat increasing mechanic is better. it's just more fun. pirate warriors does better for the one piece fans"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	Ok cool. Yeah, to be honest at first glance I thought it was going to be something like that but it wasn't.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	ya its better then those poor man dynasty warrior clones , this is a great game .
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	I haven't played a great anime game in a while. Besides DBZ budakai and Naruto clash of Ninja 2 for GameCube. I haven't had any games that i would play with my friend for hours on end
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	theres one piece pirate warriors 1 and 2 there the best one piece games so far and better then one piece red world in my opinion also theres the naruto storm series there amazing and dragon ball z only budokai 3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	if you want great anime games play Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 and Naruto Shippuden Ultimate Ninja Storm Revolution..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	this is on Vita too...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	Do you know how I can get this for the Wii U?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	"I have watched maybe one or two One Piece episodes and I had no trouble playing this game through. Yes, you might miss some of the references but the plot boils down to ""This new villain is making you fight illusions of all previous villains in the series!"" Each villain makes a snarky reference to where you first met them, then you fight.
Besides that the overall plot of the game is new so you don't need the show for that.
Good game, kept me entertained for a good 20 hours. Wii U version ran great and looked beautiful, just wish the map was on the second screen (if youre like me, you will look at that map A LOT!)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	"Late comment, but...
Yeah, the map situation SUCKED on every platform but 3DS. I couldn't believe how useful it was on 3DS and how it was missing from every other platforms (it made sense sadly on some of them, but Wii U, not using that beautiful screen for a map, come on...)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	@DanTilly  Ah, thank you. I really want to play this game since it looks amazing and I don't mind repetition at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/23/one-piece-unlimited-world-red-review	review is spot on
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	Thank god for guides and reviews. The game designers spent too much trying to make the instructions look cool, rather than making them actually be helpful.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	The first two Oddworld games were ones that got frequent plays when I was younger and I've held them close to my heart. As with most games, on trying to replay them it didn't have the same effect due to how much they've aged (although for a 1997 sidescroller I imagine they were quite impressive at the time) and this remake is like a godsend. It was done so well! Everything is recaptured as it should be. Not only is gameplay just as fun, the graphics are beautiful - the updated 3D style adds so much depth. So happy that this world has been revived for a newer generation to enjoy - even if it's a pretty grim and reflective environment to experience. I think the quirks of Abe & friends is what help lift the game a little from the morbid undertones.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	Yeah, I used that Quicksave feature and every time I died it would still put me back at the last checkpoint. What the F*CK?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	Resident Evil (1996)-> Resident Evil Remake (2002)-> Resident Evil Remake HD (2015) is a notable one so far. Kingdom Hearts is my guess at a game that'll get a minutely improved third remake for the next gen, Square's been wildly porting things around lately and it'd be absurd to waste the effort they already put into those games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	Just downloaded it now, It's awesome but can be a bit hard.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	"Why do we still not have an exact release datefor xbox one?
It says early march! It's now the 16th and still nothing. This is mid march!
Surely they have an exact date by now!?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	What a great game and a great remake! Oddworld was one of my favorite game when I was a teen. I had a N64, but my friend had a PS, and our favorite games were Oddworld and RE1. Good to see Abe again after nearly 20 years. It didn't remember it being so difficult though (jumping over mines :S). Gorgeous environments and backgrounds.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	I like it but glad I didn't spend money on it. I don't have the time to commit to a game so unforgiving of mistakes! It's a great game but I find the jumping and some of the finer movement a but frustrating at times.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/21/oddworld-new-n-tasty-review	I love the art and tone of the remastered but the controls still felt broken whenever I tried to play. Jumping was incredibly finicky and there are times when the difficulty feels slightly cheap. I don't think oddworld aged well at all

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	the game isnt bad its actualy very fcking good considering it was made in the early 90s... it has a good story that is quite difficult at some pouint and propose a really interesting kinda futuristic ambiance!! really artistic! its just looking like colin moriarty had a really hard time on this game and got blinded by his own lack of skills
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	"The author of this review was unsuitable due to his biases against games of this type. I no longer enjoy Mario on NES but this game was awesome when I was 12 and it's awesome now.
I'm playing on my PS4 and it's stealing time from Overwatch. No problem with controls if you use digital. The game is hard. REALLY hard. But no impossible or frustratingly so.
There is a pattern to everything you can learn it with trial and error. Game also only sets you back a little bit if you die so mostly there's no replay frustration.
I love Dragons Lair as well but note that FURI is my favorite game in years. Either you love pattern memorization games or you don't. This guy clearly doesn't. Except for the original Mario for some weird reason. Whatever. Nintendo is over-rated but this game sure isn't.
Also, no problem with walkthroughs if you get stuck. A little help is better than giving up. Some of the puzzles are tricky especially without a manual."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	WOW this guy works for IGN??? This guy doesn't know jack siiT. I found this game when I was 23 years old, this was back in 2008. I played it as an emulator. I was blown away. This game sucked me into a world. It's a master piece. After I passed it, I did some research on the creators . turns out only 2 people worked on the game, a sound/fx guy and a programmer/ artist. Nufsaid
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	@CHE_XAN Salt and Sanctuary is a game made by 2 people ;)

Looks perfect but moves are so f(&ced up that I am boiled.  He walks when he wants, never stop jumping, barely manage to run as he decided to walk and shoot this time. How can this so screwed up after all these years? Have anyone faced the same on Mac?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	@krs303 no one plays videogames on mac lol
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	I bet this guy didn't even get past the first part of the prison.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	"This has to be one of the most abysmal reviews I have ever read. It completely got almost everything wrong.

As a game, Another World has captivated me since I was a young kid. I can remember playing it at my grandma's house on my SNES back in the day and trying to figure out what to do. Years later, I still play this game from time to time and enjoy making my way through it just as much as I did the first time.

Just because the main character doesn't have the same agility as mario, sonic, or megaman doesn't make it a bad game. Slow and deliberate movement is part of the gameplay.

And something else Colin - the controls respond quite well. Your timing simply sucks.

As another reviewer has said, this game is widely regarded as a milestone in gaming history; its influence can still be felt to this day. The 20th Anniversary edition, while not groundbreaking, only serves to improve upon the game with better visuals and menus; it does not alter the game in a negative way.

As someone who actually knows what they're talking about, take it from me. This game is a solid 9/10 with 1 point being deducted for the fact that the game actually can be quite obtuse and vague in some points, perhaps beyond the point of frustration for some gamers (but personally, I like this)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	I am very sorry but I completely disagree with this review. This review does this game a big injustice. 4 out of 10 is a ridiculous score. This game is a regarded as a Magnum Opus and has influenced other game franchises. I am very surprised this game has received such criticism for me personally i would give this game a 9.9 out of 10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	@Retro.Gaming.World  Don't apologize. You are 100% right and this review is 100% wrong. An utter joke.

This game is a masterpiece, graphics are amazing, the intro is amazing, even more if yo consider the year and the amount of people involved in developing this game. Bad Game....go and write reviews of cooking books, and stay out of the video game industry...no wonder you only do reviews... just a question? have you ever made a game in your life, even if its a bad one?...im sure you haven't..you just write reviews....sucker!

"" you are blind or you never played a video game before PS2. This game is a masterpiece, graphics are amazing, the intro is amazing, even more if yo consider the year and the amount of people involved in developing this game. ""

Did you even read the review? Psst, the reviewer talked about Super Mario Brothers and NES Mega Man games. Those came before the PS2 in case your video game history knowledge is lacking. The review said the graphics are good, but the gameplay is bad due to the bad controls. Notice that you yourself do not say the game play is amazing, so do you agree?

"" have you ever made a game in your life, even if its a bad one?...im sure you haven't..you just write reviews....sucker!""

Have you ever written a review in your life, even if its a bad one? I'm sure you haven't... you just write comments on reviews...sucker!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	Not sure why? Cause you suck. Just because it's frustrating, doesn't mean it's bad. I'll add this reviewer to my 'not to trust' list. Look, I'm not even a huge fan... and i consider this a classic... because it deserves to be one. Not sure why my arse... Just go back reviewing some casual games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/11/another-world-20th-anniversary-review	"Another World has long been widely considered a masterpiece for a very good reason: it's fun. The fact that it's also beautiful and cleverly done certainly contributes to the judgement of history, which is, of course, a far greater judge than one Colin Moriarty 25 years after the fact. I don't need to say anymore, except, by way of example why this review is off the mark, Prince of Persia =/= Super Mario Bros. Two vastly different genres. Mr. Moriarty didn't discuss the story and its presentation, which is basically the essence of the experience that makes it a classic. Instead the review repetitiously talks about how difficult the controls were for the reviewer, even going so far as answering its own rhetorical questions in the opposite manner intended by the author, I think:

""I can't deny the feeling of accomplishment I got when I worked my way through a stubborn and annoying part of Another World, which is basically every single part of it.""

Yes, that's the point of the game.

That paragraph ends with the following sentence: ""Lester walks around like a bag of cement, he shoots his laser gun with no consistency, and he jumps like a 1,000-pound man. Where's the fun in any of that?""

I believe you just answered that question yourself."

First of all, I'm not a huge fan of platformers. But STF's concept made the game great and entertaining. 7.5 seems low.
Guacamelee, on the other hand, was boring, no idea why it is rated so high. But maybe it's because I'm not a huge game of platformers. Not hating, just not a fan."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/09/guacamelee-super-turbo-championship-edition-review	How could anyone enjoy this piece of crap? Its so boring I got it for free and deleted it after 2 hours of play time. I honestly don't get any of you who say this game is a 9.1 rating, or that its fun, and should be known as a AAA title. The graphics, playstyle, and story are nothing to be excited for. I am seriously doubting IGN reviews now. What a waste of time this game was.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/09/guacamelee-super-turbo-championship-edition-review	It is an excellent metroidvania influenced game, great level design, combat system and platforming sequences if you can't appreciate that then I feel sorry for you.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/30/blue-estate-review	Ace game! Don't listen to the IGN review, this game is great fun especially if you miss playing games like House of the Dead etc. The Dual shock gyro control is surprisingly easy to get used to and works nicely for a shooter like this. Would recommend... On PS4 it's currently £3.29... Will be buying this for the PC as well via Steam. Would recommend
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/30/blue-estate-review	Currently Bundle Stars is selling it in a 8 game bundle for $5 TOTAL. Fun games! The sexist etc references are obviously PARODY of a 'mafia goon' perspective. It's SUPPOSED to be offensive. It's not endorsing the viewpoints. It's mocking them.its humour.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/30/blue-estate-review	It's currently in the Bundle Stars $5 bundle with 7 other games!!! Riff Racer is quite good too. Can't go wrong:

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/30/blue-estate-review	"A tad unfair.

For a £10 game this is actually the best attempt at a Time Crisis-esque shooter that I've played on any home console.

As for the reviewer's focus on the moral message of the game, I know that there has been a lot of bad press about gamers and sexism in recent years, but I fear that the post-gamergate landscape could go too far the other way and lead to a lot of very po-faced reviewers breathing far too much meaning into games like this, games which are just... well...  fun!

It should also probably be noted that such hypersensitivity looks very out of place on a website that profits from idiotic, lowest common denominator click-bait bullshit (""Her camerman just kept filming. You'll never believe what happened next"" etc)."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/30/blue-estate-review	This review is a joke! It was obviously written by an overweight and oversensitive person! Cuz the game is epic and for a videogame it's pretty funny and not afraid to offend people...IGN reviews like this is why I can't trust their ratings at all

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/sniper-elite-iii-review	"7.6 Community? 8.2 IGN? Are you serious? Has everyone gone nuts? I held off as long as I could after hearing so many great raving reviews, just waiting for this price to drop after missing the 10$ window, and now, after cashing in some long-saved trade rewards, I couldn't feel more cheated. Antiquated physics, downright disgusting graphics, incredibly limited ""open-endedness"" and a sense of motion-to-control that constantly reminds you how stiff and pre-programmed previous gen animations really were compared to current engines; not only does this feel like last gen, it looks like it, plays out like it, and treats you like an idiot for not wanting a last gen game. Were this an early PS3 or 360 title, I would understand and lower my expectations significantly, but this is the same generation that brought us Battlefield 4, Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes, and Wolfenstein: The New Order, and those were just the titles released BEFORE Sniper Elite3, THE SAME YEAR! When Sniper Elite came out on the XBOX and PS2, getting behind the rifle felt nuanced and clever. V2 gave us heightened senses and brought back that feeling of risk with preparation with its PS3 and 360 upgrade. Sniper Elite 3 just feels like a standstill when everybody else is taking leaps. COD2 felt more advanced than this game and would STILL feel more advanced than this game and that's sayin somethin. Now, having said all that about the fundamental mechanics of the game, let's talk about multiplayer. What absolutely ticks me off the most about multiplayer is how so many people praised this game for saying it ""made them feel like a sniper"", when not a single mode actually effectively utilizes any semblance of caution and marksmanship aside from the same old rinse-repeat run and gun COD formula. If it's the slow gore you want, get back to Max Payne. If it's the sniping and aim assist, ramp up the difficulty on ANY of the umteen cookie-cutter COD's or Battlefields. For anything else, avoid like the plague. This is a stunted experience and to encourage it further would be to perpetuate a poor quality of entertainment. If you absolutely MUST play this, rent it."

Just noticed that this is a year old.... My bad"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/sniper-elite-iii-review	I bought it a while back :-)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/sniper-elite-iii-review	I can't stand this game sometimes. I just got a long shot on this match, and it awarded the kill to the wrong person.................... Grenades that hit someone right below their feet don't kill them and the game not counting when I kill an entire team with 1 grenade. I just rage quit after 1 match of all this happening right now if you're wondering. When it doesn't have so many bugs it's awesome, but when this stuff happens like awarding things to the wrong person or even sometimes to the enemy team causing a loss, I'm just done. Getting stuck on invisible walls in the middle of maps causing me to die is fun too though..................
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/26/sniper-elite-iii-review	"I love the sniper elite series. And this game is no exception to that :D
The graphics are great (not the best of it's time, but still really great).
Everything looks beautiful, and also important in my opinion, it looks very natural instead of artificial like GTA V or Dragon age (not that it's a bad game. for those games it works just fine). It really feels like you are out in the canyons or forests. Also the weather is very well made.
Also they improved my favorite thing about the game. The bullet ballistics and the x-ray vision. They look stunning, and are quite realistic. Also they added vehicles into the x-ray vision (much better than in V2) and you can blow them up in quite an awesome way.
The down part however is that it is way too short. Something that really bugged me, cause I could have gone on for many hours it was that awesome. The missions it does have, however, are totally awesome. I was completely stunned by awesomeness in the last mission :P
I really recommend buying this game, though I would say to buy it somewhere on sale, for the game is quite short for it's price even though it is an awesome game.

*edit*

Apparently it is able to get it for about $10 which is a very low price for this still. BUY IT! :D (Be sure to NOT buy this on normal steam pricing for $50. That it is not worth.)

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	@Counterfeitmanjako @samiup  it's funny how you can put out money purely for nostalgia. Who cares about actual gameplay LMAO
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	@samiup You probably aren't a fan of classic gaming or you just depend on HD, Full throttling graphics.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	@VillagerOfSmashVille @samiup  LOL the character control is subpar. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	I love this game. I even bought it a few times. (Wii U, PS4/Vita, 3DS (physical)). My ONLY complaint is, the enemy design. Not the bosses, they look awesome. The smaller enemies (Beetles, Green flying dino thingy) lack creativity and feel really bland.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	Honestly, It was a big mistake to me to play. This game is not for me not because is hard (Well I was annoyed that there´s a lot of Spikes and fall to make instant death), is because I did not play 8-bit games, so didn´t like the gameplay, the music for me was ok but repetitive (I imagine because the 8 bit games), even if I got killed by the levels, the boss battles are ridiculously easy, including the final boss, but i´ll admit that the graphics are amazing. I don´t think that is a terrible game, the effort that they made for this game is there, for the people who grow up with a NES and those people will like it, but I played more 16 bit games, so that´s why Freedom Planet was a better choice than this game. I could give this game a 6/10, but I think that would be unfair.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	"To be honest if you haven't played those games then you deserve to be ignorant fool.
Those were the days when real gamers were made. They were made with bloodened thumbs, rustling knuckles and sometimes a little help from a spoon or a coin."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/25/shovel-knight-review	@Timppis Well.... sorry I'm twelve. That doesn't stop me from really wanting this game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	And ign gets their review wrong again. This game is easily a 9
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	"great game. i finally took the time to play it, having it on my hd for a year now. a lot of heart went into this game and it's got a fantastic score (although not a big number of tracks, most are repeating throughout the game). loved the gameplay and the story. only thing i found a bit weird is the british voice speaking for the individual characters, e.g. when reading/writing a letter. would've been nice if Emile would have been spoken with a French accent. Though this is not a big concern. I absolutely loved the mumbled voices of the characters while playing, that you could yet somehow still understand. 
Lastly it is the only game i ever played that plays during the 1st world war. Being German myself i obviously know a lot about WWII but shockingly little about this war. So i for one appreciated all those historical facts."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	The problem with this game is not the historical facts. It's the chase/driving sequences. It's the inconsistent options. It's the hint system (which I did need a few times). While infuriating at times, the chase sequences have user friendly auto saves. The puzzle solving is drilled into your brain one way, but changes halfway through the game to include some things you aren't taught. And the hint system only shows you the pieces, not the solutions (I know that bomb is there, I've been using it for the last 5-10 minutes unsuccessfully). This is why there is an unlimited supply pile of most items needed for progression: trial and error. I also hate the puzzles involving rearranging pipe pieces with levers and wheels. Ugh. Anyways, fun game for the most part. Does a decent job of telling a story. It's still basically a browser based flash game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	Easily one of the best games I have ever played. Art, gameplay, story, music... all excellent. I ran the gamut of emotions- smiling and laughing during the car chases, raging over my poorly timed clicks as the EKGs scrolled by, and then holding back tears as the story reached it's end. It's exactly what a game should be. You cannot be disappointed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	@n4rq i totally agree. i had actual tears coming out of my eyes at the last scene, the only other game that ever did that was the last of us (sarah dying). i thought it'd be a nice game, i didn't expect it to be that good. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	Sounds like you (the reviewer) aren't happy with an American Narrator for a game set in Europe. I don't think that should drop the score of this game any points.This for sure deserves an 8.8.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	Just started it today on GWG. So far nothing but smiles from me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	One of my all time favourite gaming experiences. Really tugged at the heart as the game becomes darker as it progresses. The horrific results, experienced by so many during the Great War, comes through in this narrative. For myself, this score is way too low. Masterpiece 10/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	This is one of the best games I've ever played and it really tugs at the heart strings. This review has spoilers in it as well, good work IGN 😡
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	"One of the best games of all time. However.....

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	@nathan.collier14 exactly hahaha
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/24/valiant-hearts-the-great-war-review	Brilliant game. 10/10. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	Forgot to mention - not sure if that only mine console (PS4 pro) or all of em, but youll have many ingame crashes, visual gliches - from floatin around objects to huge acid trip like effects in game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	"The game started well enough, letting you learn how to control the plane and improving attacks on ground targets. Then as you move up the ranks, you find yourself in missions where you cannot hit mission targets in a fighter, but playing as a bomber is about as exciting as driving a tractor (wait five minutes as you get to target, hit space bar a few times, then wait another 5 minutes for another target, repeat). Then you start to see the problems with game mechanics. 

You drop off throttle because you are flying past the ground targets too fast, but you don't actually lose speed, until you try manouvering then you get a warning saying you are going too slow. 

Even though you aren't manouvering, your sights won't stay still on the target. You can actually shoot  straight at a target with a full magazine and it doesn't take one hit, even though the shots are passing straight through it. 

Worst of all is the lack of scenarios, there only seem to be about 6 on each level, so you end up repeating them time after time. 

Bottom line is it looks good, starts off well, but then you get bored of repeating the same scenarios time after time, then you start seeing the flaws in the gameplay and mechanics, and eventually wish you hadn't bothered. I certainly wouldn't spend money on it 2/5 for the first few days of enjoyment. Put it this way, I had a choice today of playing war thunder or putting my DVDs in alphabetical order - My DVDs won"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	Russian cash grab after Tier 4. Piece of shit Russian bias all over. Trump would love this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	"HORRIBLE LAG! I mean, HORRIBLE! I am hardwired & getting 60 mbps & the game is just frustrating.
When driving, my tanks will turn left, or right ON THEIR OWN & cause me to spin.
When an enemy is near, I go to aim & my crosshair will freeze & then jump, most of the time I get killed before I can aim, because even if I get my crosshair on an enemy, it will jump off of them.
PS4 players ALWAYS spawn later than PC players. Most of the time the PC players are already halfway to the objectives, if not at the objectives. On small maps, sometimes PC players are already on the outskirts of our spawn before I have even spawned making it difficult, if not impossible to even get out of the spawn.
The game is ""free to play"" & looks great. Just don't spend ANY MONEY on the download content until the, apparently incompetent, developers care enough to fix the lagging servers & the handful of issues that put console players at a disadvantage.
The game favors PC players. Some turn their graphics on low, so they can have superior lines of sight. Some use aimbot hacks (search YouTube gor War Thunder aimbots & you will see videos of people using them). These things coupled with the late spawning put console players at a disadvantage.
Play it for free, just don't give them any money until they fix the issues."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	"Umm this game was great until you reach tier IV and then it becomes a literal cash grab. You cant make enough Edollars to afford the tanks you worked your ass off to achieve. They will bleed you and their events are tailored to the typical ""i aint got shit to do so i'll play games for 12 hours crowd"" Premiums not even worth it after tier 3. Shitty tanks like the Ostwind, and Caernevon cost way more to repair than theyre worth."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	"The ""generous rewards"" went away a few patches ago too. I think this game needs an updated review."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/20/war-thunder-review	This game doesn't deserve high reviews anymore. Check it out again. Good game, but horrible company decisions.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/19/ea-sports-ufc-review	I easily give this a 9. Love the submission battles. Preffered the original subs in execution, but they were too easily spammed online. This fixed that problem. Much better then what they were trying to do with UFC 3's sub system of chase the blue dot. Great game, still playing online weekly!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	I'm so confused by this review and these comments. So it's a negative that a game reminds you that it's a game? Doesn't every game do that? I mean, last of us reminded me it was a game? But it was also a cinematic experience and excellent story. I'm 40yrs old now and I was actually just talking about how I suck at video games now in my old age when I used to be very good before. I picked up this game and about an hour later I had easily gone through all nine levels. What was so frustrating about it? I mean, those end stages caused me to mess up a couple of times but I wouldn't say it was like trying to pass a single stage in super meat boy where it takes a hundred frustrating tries. The music was great and I was relaxed playing it. Enjoying it while still playing what I thought was a good quick game that I could enjoy at night when my family is sleeping and I put on my headsets to enjoy the music and mood. Boohoo. It was too hard. What's wrong with this generation?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	I actually have a PS4 and don't have an Xbox One yet, so..... yeah. My previous comment stands. There was absolutely no significant amount of hype for this game at all.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	Shame such a beautiful game is so frustrating to play. It never helps when you are reminded you're playing a game, really takes you out of the experience.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	At E3 when this was previewed i thought that it would be a nice relaxing game that would melt the stress away , after recently purchasing Entwined i broke it up over a few days and by the latter stages it became increasingly frustrating and fiddly taking away the harmony and relaxation mood the game was aiming for. The visuals are gorgeous very bright and vibrant very enjoyable to play until the latter stages.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	And people wonder why people think gamers are entitled dicks.. These comments sections are just sad. For little more than the cost of a McDonalds meal you get a game that is visually stunning, has a cool score, is something different and while theres not much substance to the gameplay its certainly enjoyable as a simple pick up and play game for a little while between other more time consuming games. Nothing amazing but worth a go for the price, But no. Just bile, whining and fanboyism as per usual.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	Oh, look another overhyped Playstation 4 game, how unexpected.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	Overhyped? lol this tiny game was revealed at E3 at the same time it went on sale. Xbot loser.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	Oh, look, another self-important, secretly jealous and bitter x-box fanboy troll who hasn't got a life or a girlfriend, how unexpected.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	Overhyped? There was never much hype to begin with
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/18/entwined-review	Beautiful yet frustrating, like Taylor Swift.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	Definitely not worth 60$ (I played it for free on the shield hub) but I don't get why the low reviews. There's a story to this game, not like just about every other senseless violent video game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	"The stories are pretty interesting, but most other things are not.

The collectibles are anoying as hell, like the ghost girl graffity. You have to stand close to a wall to actually get the prompt to reveal it, and there are a lot of walls so it's very easy to miss.

Combat just get's in the way of the story and is also not really fun.

I'd give it a 7, fun and interesting story with some interesting idea's but anoying combat and to much collectible bullshit."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	The game is one of the worst ports for PC I've had the displeasure of playing.  The keyboard mouse interface is bugged to the point of being broken.  Among other things the player will get trapped inside the clue window with no option to get out other than force closing the game after trying to use the mouse.  The game has no manual save feature so you lose game progress as a result.  There are plenty of other bugs as well and zero developer support 2 years after release. 5.5 is more than a fair rating for the game. Basically never get this game for the PC unless it is on a massive sale as it was for the Steam Summer Sale.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	"MOST people's inner thoughts are mundane, no idea why you expected the NPC's to be any different.  And I have no idea what you expected upon first putting the game in, but it is clearly FAR different than almost every other gamer, given that when actual players review it, it's a 7 or a 9.

The game is like every other detective game with the bonus of a good mystery and many fun side stories.  Lower your expectations if you want anything to be worth it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	I like the story, but personally, I think that it would be better without the demons. I think they're really unnecessary :/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	I enjoy this game and for me, it's nice to play something not so action oriented.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	Games about detectives are often Lame because if you make a game where there is a real chalange, checkpointing and restarting the level a few times will stil help you to get all the chivements and complete the game. It's the same as with games that give you choices, there are no wrong choices that will make you lose, they are just all very different.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	@Crag_hack  Sometimes I don't care about the puzzles, but Life is strange on PC was made great storyline and good checkpoint system. It had flaws maybe but its one of the best games I ever played simply because its storyline is top notch, shame its too short.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	i really like this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	I really enjoyed this game. I think what happened was that it was not marketed well. It was not what people expected from the hype, it could have been marketed differently. To me, it felt like a modern third-person Myst game. Has a lot of similarities with L.A. Noire. It sucks that Airtight Games went down because they were probably going to do some really cool games in the future. I would give it an 8.5 or a 9.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	@BERT0503 I'm playing this game right now, and really enjoying it, and shocked the review scores were so low.  Yet reviewers continue to heap praise on Telltale, which continues to make games where your choices matter not a whit, while marketing the games pretending your choices are impactful.  This game is much more honest in its aims, and a ton of fun as long as you're in the mood for exploration-based gameplay and not wanting an Assassin's Creed or Far Cry.  Story is king here, and both the main story and supporting stories are interesting and entertaining.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	@bctoohey @BERT0503 Definitely.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/06/02/murdered-soul-suspect-review	I really enjoyed this game. I think what it came down to was that it was not marketed well. To be honest, it felt to me like a third-person Myst game and I enjoyed Myst back in the 90s. I think if it would have been marketed well it may have done better. These type of games are hated it or love it games, the last game I played that was similar was L.A. Noire. Sucks that Airtight Games closed, they were onto some fun stuff. I would give it an 8.5 or a 9.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review	A wonderful story and a very enjoyable game

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review	Just downloaded the game yesterday and I have to say, some weird things going on. One, it's hard to find objects sometimes, like people killing others etc. Makes it difficult to stop them. I will tell you this was the precursor to The Division though for sure. Exact same concept instead of hacking like this game, it just a virus instead. Same idea though. Fun to play, not sure how long I can sit and play it though.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review	Great game just wish their was a save game and load game instead of overwritten autosaves.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/27/watch-dogs-review	This review has to be a joke...The game can be rushed. Hacking was a drawback and only slowed down missions. Has anyone actually tried just running up on every guard during missions? It's literally 5x faster than using hacked devices.

Needless to say, from art direction to sound design, every aspect of this game is amazing. I well deserved 9 and a highly addictive indie. Time to Recurse!
But, yeah, the Snapshots are pretty annoying."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/20/transistor-review	This is one of my favorite video games of all time. All of it's great elements, from the amazing voice acting and the soundtrack, to the gorgeous art style, to the smart story, to the excellent gameplay, are perfectly put together to make an amazing video game. Love it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	with the new one  coming out just around the corner I decided to replay the game. This score still pisses me off now more then ever. the game is one of the best single player FPS experiences out there hands down. The old Blood is a great game as well. this review is garbage  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	You give this great game 7.8 while you give CoD advanced warfare 9.1 how stupid are you. It's like they say you can't spell ignorant without IGN.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	"Passed on this game the first time round as I had a backlog at the time and coudn't justify the purchae. Picked it up on the store as it is a steal at 5 quid. Absolutely loving it at the moment. I agree with the cons (dual wielding is pointless and cumbersome) ditto with having to press square, but its a harsh score to mark it under 8 for that??!

I have to disagree with the point about a weak opening segment. I thought it was brilliantly paced with a terrible consequence choice at the end. And scaling the side of the fortress was just brilliant.

I was surprised with the noir-esque story telling, and the sheer brutality of it (the bit in the cellar of the polish people had a definitely element of inglorious bastards to it)

Cant wait to get home and play it tonight"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	I hate these games where you have to do ridiculous game controller puzzles. Its like if you were locked in a room in reality & in order to get out you have to pat your butt cheek rub your belly in a circle and find the magic spot  on the wall that you run into at full sprint. Do it forty times till you get it right and wait for god to give you life again for twenty seconds each time u knock yourself out and into coma 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	"I remember reading this review back in 2014, and deciding to give the game a pass.  My reasoning was that I had fought Nazis a billion times in my video game career. I did not feel the need to do so again.  In conversations with friends, we discussed how the ww2 thing had been done to death on every form of entertainment; we were getting sick of the fact that they were still making these stories.  It wasn't that we had anything against the second world war, but we wanted artists to explore more original time periods when they created new historical fiction.

Now the year is 2017, and this game cannot download fast enough onto my ps4 hard drive.  There has never been a more appropriate time to shoot at Nazis in a video game!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	"Having just completed this game, I find it hard to agree with the concluded review found by IGN. It's almost as if reviewers look for more to complain about then to look for things to enjoy. Story-driven games are certainly not as popular as they once were, and the story here is pretty engaging. As a history buff, I've always wondered what would have happened if the Germans had won WWII -where would technology be? What would the world look and feel like? For me, this game -much like the title of this review- answers that question while it tells a story to the player.

I don't think the story was as compelling as the Bioshock series, but it was certainly really badass and creepy. I personally felt the game felt incredible as a first-person shooter. Unlike a lot of games that take out the physical movements of the character as a limitation, this game felt more ""real simulation"" in that regard. Have a huge gun? Well it would have trouble aiming around a wall or ducking behind cover. Need to move? There was actual acceleration rather than instant fluid movement on a game like Doom.

This game will be played through again for sure, but to rate this game under an 8 by the IGN staff is a shame."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	@VisceralShot10 Could not agree with you more! 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	Actually having to press a button to pick up the items makes it feel very new. Both original Wolfenstein and Doom gave you items automatically by walking over them, and that's what makes The New Order feel weird, especially now in retrospect compared to new Doom which still maintains that old item pickup mechanic.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	@Grenadeh I think it makes it more challenging especially on harder difficulties where ammo is so essential. If you do not slow down to pick up the ammo you have just earned, you could make later sections of the game harder for yourselves when you are left with a big mech completely out of shotgun and missile ammo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	....this game kick's some serious ass !!!! Loved it a LOT !!!! Haven't played it without Fergus yet, don't know how that would go as he's just about the star of the show imho !!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	Just finished on I Am Death Incarnate. I have not enjoyed a game this much in many years. At 36, I grew up w/ the original. I was entranced with this game and really drank it in, took my time, enjoyed myself. What a satisfying, well done game this was. I got choked up at the end. So worth it! 8.8/10 IMO.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	I wish they would make a game that presents a realistic alternate history version of the world after a German World War 2 victory, not this far fetched nonsense based on all kinds of old wives tales like a German desire to invade and conquer America. All this does is make people even more ignorant about WW2 and what is was about.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/19/wolfenstein-the-new-order-review	"@aksiram There are tons of documented counts (including in Hitler's book) of wanting to conquer America.

They even had officers studying American geography for obvious strategic reasons.

Ignorance is a word often misused by the ignorant."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/mario-kart-8-review	DreamWorks Kartz is better than Mario Kart 8, It's got characters from DreamWorks Animation movies like Madagscar, Madagascar, Monsters Vs. Aliens and HTTYD (How To Train Your Dragon).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/mario-kart-8-review	@EspioArtwork-9 Yeah--no.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/15/mario-kart-8-review	I like the game very much. Before 200cc, Once you finished everything from 50cc and even 150cc, it started getting boring, as you know everything already. The Amiibos weren't that much of an award to the game, as there is nothing as special as new characters. Today, Mario Kart 8 is still fast paced, no matter if 200cc gets boring by August 2016, It will show a lot more graditude from the Mario Kart subseries!

-there's the same silly humour and same wooden acting that makes such games great fun to play. It might look barren to some, but pips who grew up playing games like Morrowind will instantly feel at home.
Also, I like the battle system. Although not too sure about those skill trees."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/08/outlast-whistleblower-review	Just got the Lunatic Trophy for the base game and now re-playing Whistleblower to 100% the docs/notes and for the insane trophy.  I have to say the one thing that Marty doesn't mention that really brings the DLC down a notch or two is the over-the-top grossness of the DLC bosses, particularly The Groom.  The base game is pretty much a masterwork in how it tells the story, the use of scripted moments, and the supporting score that functions like the best accompanying orchestra to heighten and put a pin on many moments.  Outlast is a gory, over-the-top, gross-out game to begin with... but the base game feels much classier than Whistleblower.  I did enjoy the way the narrative weaves back and forth with the original, but I would have appreciated bosses that were more scary and subtle and less focused on simply increasing shock value.  And as Marty notes, it gets frustratingly repetitive at points where the tight environments means watching dozens of character deaths before you have time to fully explore your surroundings with the bosses on your heels and nowhere to hide from them long enough to buy yourself sufficient exploration room.  Even getting stabbed to death in the testicles eventually gets old after a couple dozen times.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/30/the-amazing-spider-man-2-game-review	Another thing too is the story is so so so short! 17 missions?? Then after its just repeatable side missions it's awful
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/30/the-amazing-spider-man-2-game-review	i hope they make a better GAME ITS SO SAD!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/30/the-amazing-spider-man-2-game-review	what does that have to do with anything? The game is trash
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/29/daylight-review	That honestly had to be the most un-funny thing I've ever seen. 50 bucks says these WAY too easily entertained douchebags just LOVE Five Nights at Freddy's
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	Hmmm I didn't really care for the combat in this game. Got bored and stopped. Tried Odin sphere instead and was blown away.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	The most comments here have me covered in almost any way, but guys this game i bought it i dont know something like 15 euros on physical edition obliterates most 60+ generic rpgs. Easily one of my favorite games ever played, i m telling you i m 30 and a gamer for 20+ years, this game just buy it will stay in your memory. On the vita it was an absolute fantastic experience, that's a AAA game and god that music... thx ubi unlike the ac recent fails this is a pure gem.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	$10 on cdkeys.com
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	I finally got around to finishing this game and it is the most cohesive game I have played in a very long time. I enjoyed everything. It's beautiful, I cared about the characters, I wanted to finish side tasks (which aren't plentiful enough to become a burden, if anything it could have used more). Also in a lot of games, I will listen to podcasts/my own music as I play/explore, but I really wanted to listen to the soundtrack in this case, and the flute segments are fantastic. It's not my normal game type, but this did everything perfectly.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	Oh, another best thing in this game is the soundtrack, especially the two Boss battle songs (cannot remember where the one plays, but the one if i recall is in 3hydra boss), but i'm referring them as boss battle theme 2 and 3, seriously, that two song is so epic and is one of the best boss battle song, such a shame that UBI did not add it it in the original soundtrack tape itself, it would be good and nice if they add it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	"Child of light can simply wipe out the other RPG games, i played this one with my brother, which seems that he was so amazed of the art of the game, however, there are some part of games that can make aurora slow (if you are on PC). I did not like RPG much but COL is one of the few RPG game that made me play it for infinite times


(Ps. I beat CoL in only a single day LOL)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	It's only $5 on PSN now. Time to finally get it in psvita
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	I looked it up and it shows as $15 for me. Where do you see it as $5?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	"Except the game allows you to hotswap characters with no penalty, so even though only two are technically in combat at a given time, in reality you are tapping into up to 8 characters at a time for a single combat.


Indeed, that's one of the great things about this game - while the gameplay is shallow in some areas, there are just so many playable characters who all get engaged, it adds surprising depth."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	You seem to have lost the plot. There is almost no spoken dialogue in the game. Maybe in the intro and one or two places, but basically the entire game, cut-scenes includes, is text.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/28/child-of-light-review	If you played 5 minutes more you would realize that the actual characters dont speak, it is 100% the writing on the bottom, zelda style. The only time there are subtitles for someone who is speaking is the narrator, and she only speaks like 4 times in the entire game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/04/10/lego-the-hobbit-review	I like the game but its ridiculous when we have all these character's to play with and yet when we have to build something and one character has one of the items and another character has one of the items we cant share that loot with one player so we can continue building. Or at least be able to put in what we have then use another character to put in the rest, I am beyond annoyed with this. In the high pass two diamonds are required, one character had one diamond and the other had another diamond and because the one didnt have both I still couldnt finish and ended up having to restart.

Personally, I'd like a game that goes back to the olden days of Lego. When instead of elaborate themes, they were based on simple ideas. Like Lego Pirate, Lego Forestmen, and Lego Castle.
I'd LOVE an open world Lego Pirate game where you sail your own ship between land masses. Lego City Undercover on Wii U at least went back to the old Lego City theme, which is really the only classic line that's still in production. I'd like to see more of that, and less of the licensed games (even though I do love the licensed games as well; Lego Star Wars 1 & 2 are among my favorites.)"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/infamous-second-son-review	This game is overrated. The gameplay is boringly repetitive, the story is completely unengaging, and the upfront morality decisions take the fun out of choosing between good and evil. To top it off, there are no interesting side quests and the overworld is not entertaining to explore. Don't listen to IGN's ludicrous 8.7 review score. Infamous Second Son is a disappointing and limited open world game which I feel deserves about a 6.0 review score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/infamous-second-son-review	That's just like your opinion man.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/20/infamous-second-son-review	I just played it and thought it was atleast an 8.0, just because you think something doesn't make IGN wrong that is why it is an opinion.

I was disappointed of the length at first but the replay ability changed my mind.  Great prequel or sequel (for me) to Son's.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review	"A game with great graphics from the Fox Engine with highly good textures in the environment and objects, weather effects, lens flares in lighting, realistic movement in the human interaction, a day-night cycle included in the later game, well done character models in the game, impressive sound effects, enemy AI that can act predictable and unpredictable whenever it wants to for a stealth game, and a smooth frame rate in next gen consoles and PC. Gameplay with well done stealth gameplay just like the previous Metal Gear games with the best control in the a Metal Gear franchise. Well done voice acting and Kiefer Sufferland does solid job as Big Boss but it feels incomplete without David Hayter as the Snake that we know of from the previous games, well written and interesting developed characters with the inclusion of Skull Face with an interesting backstory, and an appropriate soundtrack that fits the tone with the game, and collectables that are worth it to install to the next game to add in more story in it. What falls ""short"" the keyword is short is that the open world feels small and you can't go anywhere outside of the Black Site in Cuba thanks for invisible walls, a weak story of how Snake lost his arm but with good action scenes, some of the characters aren't that well developed in storytelling, and a short main story mission that lasted two hours and the side ops missions lasted another two hours which is four hours of gameplay with its last year retail price of $39.99 an overpriced demo a kind of dirty business practice that makes Konami look pretty shady and they already are just to cash in on fans of the anticipated Phantom Pain which is already release. If you want to play Ground Zeroes rent it and it's now $20.00 to buy but I would still wait for the price to drop below 20 bucks or even better borrow it from a friend and I got the game for free on Xbox Live for the 360 but since I played it I would get an next gen console or PC to play the game again and add my complete objectives and collectables to the Phantom Pain. Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes gets an 6/10."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review	What a great segue for Phantom Pain, can't wait to play it tonight.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/18/metal-gear-solid-5-ground-zeroes-review	"Just played through the main campaign and didn't even know that side missions existed. It seems like the game just went black after the post credit exposition finished. Maybe I will play this some more beyond my initial 2 hours. I am glad I got it for free (with PSplus).
I never played Metal Gear games before, but got this to see if I would enjoy Phantom Pain, which is getting unignorably good reviews. Despite reading the backstory provided in the game, I have no idea what's going on. All I know is I killed a lot of US Marines for seemingly no reason, which makes me feel a little guilty. Still, I'm tempted to give Phantom Pain a try depending on how enjoyable the side missions are.
P.S. Do British people really pronouce ""Omega,"" ""Amiga""?"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	8.9? Come on guys just sling it a 9 and be done with it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	Well at 6 notes had give it a try 2yrs late. Well how enjoyable. No matter how bad you are you always feel like you've helped by getting minion kills. When playing and not in a titan its like you've entered a Michael bay transformers movie. Its controls are simplistic and comfortable. Wish I'd of bought it sooner. First in que for number 2
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	Five bucks for Gold members Halloween weekend 2015. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	@WightHolly Do you think it still worth? I'm looking to buy it but the Titanfall 2 is almost releasing...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	Awful and a disaster.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	Have been checking out reviews for this game considering whether to buy it or not ( £12 btw ) , by the looks of game play the only fun aspects look like wall running and having a go in the titanfalls but other than that looks mainly just like call of duty which I don't like cuz I'm a BF player . Wiv no campaign I don't see why this is an 8.9 ? Jus confused ign lol . I'm jus gona but watchdogs anyway
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	this game got such a high score it was and still is a terrible game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	@gamer4f4fa1e1e4b08 no, it wasn't fuckface
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	Jesus is this score too high (Cough Bribe Cough). Base game is no more than a 6.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	just got confused. i bought this game and i dont have gold member. SMH..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2	All Titanfall needed was a campaign like Killzone ( not refering to ShadowFall but to KZ2 and 3, not that shadowfall had a bad campaign its just that it ignored the previous 99.9% its history ). Titanfall is for me the best FPS in the market and has the best MP aswell. If Respawn keeps all of the good they got and adds whats missing then Titanfall will be the most played FPS in years to come.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/06/basement-crawl-review	basement slog
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/25/plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-review	My first impression is that this game is very charming and simplistic version of modern first person shooter game. It does lack split screen modes though. I regress, THE split screen mode (singular). Users are forced to play online... that, my friends, sucks.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	I don't understand all the negativity for this game from the unified gaming press. Hitman Absolution was to the Hitman series what Thief is to the Thief series (supposedly) but here is the thing, I hated HA because it was nothing like a HM game but I really like Thief as it is still very much a Thief game. And HA got universal praise for being different by the same gaming sites that hated on Thief for being a little different. OK, I can only compare the reboot to the Thief game that came out on the original Xbox, which I liked at the time for what is was, a medievilesque reskin of Deus Ex. But I am having a blast on Thief. I like the atmosphere and look, I like how Garret feels to control, everything works is it should and it's a fun, romp of a game if you aren't a blatant pc Übermensch fanboy.  I joined to say I disagree with the low score IGN has given this pretty good game when they dish out 9's and 10's for games like Clone of Duty 25-black/silver/gold ops. It is clear from the review the reviewer went into this came already predisposed to hate on it. Must be a pc gamer. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	Mediocre 5/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	@KingsGamer Considering the original games were just re-skinned Deus Ex...that's an ambitious comment. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	@GamerCynic @KingsGamer The originals were still immersive-sims, but I think they were different enough to be more than 're-skins' of Deus Ex.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	I'm big fan of the old Thief games, and I'm giving this 9 on PS4. It really is good all round, and has the same feel to it than the classic thief games had. There are also lots of improvements over the old games, of course, making this one my fave Thief game of all time!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	"I think the game is definitely worthy of an 8. I will have to react to one of the older comments here from duncan29, because he says a lot of silly things that simply aren't true.

First, I agree with him somewhat in regards to the story. It kinda feels like even the characters don't give a damn about it. Very early spoiler (like, very first mission/prologue spoiler): Garrett has been apparently unconscious for a year, but he acts like he was out for 2 days. Everybody acts like its perfectly normal for anyone to be in a coma of some sort for a year. No kriff given. Weird.
Second, I also agree with him about the sounds, in a way. It's not ""Garrett's superhearing"" though, it's just a bugged sound system. Conversation pieces can be stuck on loop forever, sound very loud or very quiet, completely independent from the distance of the speaking person.

With that said:
- Doors are there in every house. Yes, even the City Watch Offices. They are non-interactive though, because those parts of the houses were not modeled/designed by the devs. Or did you really think there are homes that consist of a single bedroom, nothing else? There are doors in every house that can't be opened, but you can very safely assume they lead to other parts of the same building.
- The crowbar isn't in your inventory? You don't say? Have you noticed that the grappling hook (not the arrows) and the blackjack isn't in your inventory either? Or the lockpicks? Hmm, that's possibly because _they aren't consumables_!!! Use your head, please.
- ""No skill in pressing E"". True. But it's hell of a convenient way to quickly steal everything and open doors and use stuff. Same as in the earlier Thief games. Instead of E, you just used the left and right mouse buttons in those ones. Would that be better? The skill is in completing missions with all the challenges. On Master difficulty. Have fun!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	The original Thief is one of my favorite games ever. This NuThief sucks
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	"Hey guys- I know its old- but I did a review of this game- I think I gave it lower than they did. If you wanna see some good gameplay check out the
vid: https://www.youtube.com/watch?..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	This is not a great game, by any stretch of the imagination. However, I disagree about the voice acting - it's not great, but seriously, IGN gave The Witcher 3 a 9.3, and some of the voice acting in it is god awful. Yes, you're limited in your approaches - but I don't think that the limit is as constricting as the reviewer implies... and the reloads in the city? a bit annoying, but given the graphics quality of the game, I'll deal with it. I'd give it a 7.5-7.8 (on console).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	I had the same thing yesterday with the guard room! I was alos looking for a door everywhere until I realized tey aparently all climb through the window
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	"Except for a ""3"", I agree with everything you said."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/24/thief-review	I think this game deserves a fair 8 at least. It may have been less than what everyone were expecting, both fans and non-fans, but it's a damn good game and every fan of the Stealth genre would enjoy this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/18/strider-review	"although I agree with 7.5, and most of the critic, I can't possibly believe the author criticized the game as unbalanced. If you kept the same pace everytime, the game would get boring real quick. There are plenty of child games where you can simply mash the attack button to the victory. Theres plenty of health to pick up in the entire game. Heck, there are rooms that will fill your health bar for free everytime you go through it! What else do you want?

Some parts require a lot more than that, and some bosses are going to be difficult. Difficult boss battles is what makes a great game. 

My criticism: no jungle? Felt the game could be longer - beat it in about then hours revisiting every map to collect items. 

Cant recommend it enough. Looking forward to sequels."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/18/strider-review	I genuinely enjoyed this game. It is metroid-lite in the sense it didn't have the same depth but as an old skool platformer I couldn't put it down and completed it twice
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/18/strider-review	Score is about right though I would say it deserves an 8 just because it was developed well enough for a second playthrough for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/18/strider-review	@Glongold same here! Had so much fun with the game I'm trying to collect everything  on the hard mode.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	I gave up on this game...I have no patience anymore. My 4 year old son beat it though.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	Got it from club nintendo yesterday and am having a blast. Best 2D platformer from nintendo in a long time.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	"Purchased this last week and absolutely love it. I honestly think it has some of the best graphics of any current gen game which kinda surprised me. Really vibrant and clear, crisp colours and depth and the gameplay itself is really really solid. The levels are amazing and yes some parts are really difficult but that just makes completing the levels so rewarding. I usually yell out ""Yesss"" when I actually get through a hard part haha. Its also just nice to sit on the couch and play a simple, happy, positive game which is why I'll always come back to Nintendo."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	Nintendo is very good at making their games look better than what the hardware is capable of with art style and textures. :)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	This is just a solid game. Definitely underrated as far as sales go. It is on my Top 10 Wii U games. If you have always been a fan of Donkey Kong Country, this is a must buy. The difficulty might be too much for some kids under 10 but it's one of those games you will keep coming back for. One of the best things is the two-player co-op. Love playing with my spouse. The most fun was probably the boss in each world. At least rent it if you can.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	I wonder... Instead of ditching the console entirely, what if Nintendo released their top franchises on other consoles 2 years after their home comsole, and maybe not all of them. It could spur sales of their dystem down the road, if MS and Sony allowed it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	@Kardes21 No. Mobile is where the videogame industry is going. That's why Nintendo is bringing some of their games to mobile. Smart move Nintendo, smart move!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	"Im finally getting this game! christmas bonus is here and I can catch up!
I thought Nintento was never going to give me time to buy this game! there is yoshi, mario maker, splatoon, zelda, fox, party coming 2015 and I saw it tough to buy all of them!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	"There's a bit of exageration on this review when saying this is a very hard game. Seriously, I have a life playing 2d plataformers, and to me, I don't see the insane difficulty they say, maybe in some levels, but there are checkpoints and many lifes, and the secondary characters can help you in all levels with their floating abilities... When you say that this game is very hard, I imagine a person that never played 2d games and have terrible timing problems, because if you have played, you will not have many problems.
People are really so familiarized with easy games that when they take a 2d plataformer that requires a bit more precision and fast thinking, they say the game is insanely hard? It's the kind of game that will be hard as much as you want, because you can just beat the game, or you can find all secrets and beat all levels.
Even if you die in some level, there are checkpoints and you already know what to expect, so you will pass through with a few tries. But the game has a great level design, it's not that hard for players that don't sucks, buy yes, is a challenging game, a good challenging."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	"As with Mario games, I always try to get the hard levels with stock mario, I want to play this game with ""stock"" donkey kong, if thats the way to call it. Even if it is harder it will be worth it!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	I want this game to come to 3DS
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/02/17/donkey-kong-country-tropical-freeze-review	The 3DS wouldn't do this game justice

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	Better than Rise of The Tomb Raider. In fact, Rise seems like a reboot of this. Tomb Raider 2013 had better story, better Lara model(before they gave her the anime hair), weapons, and this one is not as aliased and jaggy, so, better graphics, too...and it doesn't crash on my Ps4 Pro like Rise incessantly does.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	Anyone not see this is their PlayStation Plus games anymore? I had beaten it but don't see it in any of my games. I'm scared!!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	@Liberalredneckgamer  late response but this was never a PS Plus title. The original PS3 version was but not the DE, at least not in NA
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	Indeed you're correct, I'm not it NA, but it is the same here .
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	anyone know why they changed lara's face???? what was wrong with the original PC version of it? the rise of the tomb raider face is changed YET AGAIN
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	"Just getting around to playing this now and am enjoying it way more than Uncharted. Its obvious both took cues from one another but from a gameplay and story standpoint, I think Tomb Raider is millions of times better. Just my opinion though.

Look forward to getting  Rise of The Tomb Raider later in the year. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	The characters are the only weak link to me. Even Lara herself I am not a huge fan of. I felt she was a bit whiney and the other characters were just there.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	i got this at Square Enix Discount Sale. so i bought it for $7.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	Just completed this on ps4, got about 1/2 way through on ps3 before I upgraded. Have to say it's one one of the best adventures I've experienced on this gen or last. Great game, well balanced, slightly dodgy enemy ai, but that's fine. The bow is awesome. Lara's journey is awesome. I finished with 88% completed, think that's it though. I did all the tombs so not really fussed about GPS cache and notes and what not. All in all I'd give this game 9.5 on ps4, all the added features really elevated it from the last gen versions, which to be fair are about a 8.5. Can't wait (have to wait) for rise now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/24/tomb-raider-definitive-edition-review	I really enjoyed playing it.  Very similar to Uncharted, of course, however I would say Uncharted had more memorable characters and better background music.  8.5/10 for me :)

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/13/dont-starve-ps4-review-2	"This has become one of my favorite games ever. Like top five. It's damn addicting - survive for a while, die, learn from that death. Survive longer, die, lose everything, do it again better next time. Hardcore mode is always on.

Starving is a minor concern, this game should have been called ""Don't Die"" or ""Murphy's Law."" Oooh maybe ""Black Swan"" as in you don't know what's coming. So many different items and and things to make! If you don't just wiki everything right away you will have fun learning all the different food recipes, ways to kill stuff, and different ways to die."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/13/dont-starve-ps4-review-2	Noted. I think I just might check it out.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/13/dont-starve-ps4-review-2	I really wish Mister Sliva didn't complain so much about a game not holding his hand. It makes it difficult for me to utilize his review to determine whether or not I should buy the game. Is it a flaw with the game, or is he being too self-entitled? I can't tell from here.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/13/dont-starve-ps4-review-2	"I had a 200 day world, no sign of stopping. I died because I was missing one stick to make a damn torch. Hours of gameplay, an epic base, and everything worked for gone. It was my fault, but oh the sting is real.

The randomized worlds can screw you over sometimes too. Eventually you'll learn what a good world layout is, and sometimes need to restart.

You will die and lose it all, pretty much always. Random wolf attacks will come at the worst moments. A Deerclops WILL walk up and destroy everything. A Bearger WILL come for your honey, and stay to kill all your beefalo. If you can't put up with that, this game isn't for you. Unless you backup your save or somesuch. But that'd ruin the tension."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/13/dont-starve-ps4-review-2	Hang on now; backing up your game is possible? That gives people options. Sounds pretty good, honestly. In any case, tension is what I'd be going for. I was weaned on NES games that didn't save your progress; I miss that a little bit. Maybe I'm a slight masochist.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/13/dont-starve-ps4-review-2	"Well, I'm on PC. You can just go into my documents and make your own backup of your save file. This is considered cheating by most, and really does ruin the spirit of the game if you ask me. But whatever floats a person's boat.


I figured you can do this on any console as long as you can find the save.


This game is perfect for a masochist! lol. By the way you sound, just get the game you'll like it."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	I'm glad this got a 5.8 ... Halo games have been horrible since Bungie stopped making them. I've played every Halo since the OG Xbox was out up until Halo 4. They fooled me once with Halo Reach, and fooled me a second time with Halo 4.The franchise died after Halo 3, because they got too focused on getting COD fans and making the game 'fair' or 'fun' by taking out the 1-50 trueskill rankings that showed next to your name
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	This isn't a major Halo game, its just a twin stick shooter made on the side of things. Halo 5 will be awesome. In my opinion Halo 4 was great except it's multiplayer straying away a little with the original Halo way of doing MP. Halo Reach was made by Bungie.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	What if i told you... Halo Reach was made by Bungie?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	"Ha, right i was going to say this than saw your post. Also i enjoyed 4 just hated the final boss ""battle""."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	i love bees have you see it yet anyone
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	"While this is a ""mediocre"" game entertainment wise. It's mechanics are sound. And it accomplishes what it sets out to do. I think they need to do away with this exact to the point scaling system. There should be BAD games, Mediocre games, Good games worth playing, great games and masterpieces. So much easier the 1-5 star system is. And much more accurate. I mean what exactly does the .8 of the 5 represent? Why not 6? What is .2 score points off about the game? Another thing is all these mediocre games seem to get mediocre scores.... but only have one or two complaints in them. Like this one. I mean come on, games should be scored based upon what they are trying to do, what kind of game they are trying to be."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	I like the more technical aspect. I think that gives the most justice to the developers. But since we have been in school from kindergarten to college , your graded usually on a scale of 1 to 100. Not 1 to 5, so I don't see why we should change the rating scale on a gaming site to make it special in that aspect.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	I guess this wasn't just coincidence then..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	"Wish I could get my money back.
This game completely sucked, and IGN were completely justified in calling it mediocre.
From now on, if I buy a Halo game, it has to be an FPS.
What a disaster."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	"i dont think i want to play this game, the fact the story is that ur a playing a game (i mean ""historical simulation"") within the game based on one of the most hated characters in halo 4 is off putting."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	"Yeah, I was pretty disappointed the game was a ""simulation"" through the Infinity. I also didn't like how you only get a cut scene, 30 seconds tops cut scene at that after the sections 5-6 missions. The only other story is a paragraph or two between missions of written word. Which I don't mind, it is just disappointing. Though that was stupid. Couldn't even give me a small story to provide real, true insight into the events between the wars end and the rebels and Forerunner story of 4-6. These thigns wouldn't have been as disapointing if maybe I'd bought it on my Android. But I bought this for my Xbox One thinking it was a re polished, slightly re did Halo game. 5+ missions doesn't count. Guess I shoulda done my research"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	It's a fun game and it manages to feel like Halo despite the different set-up, but I have to agree that if you took all the halo wrapping off it would be far less appealing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	I stopped at Halo 2...this is sad...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	well you missed out. Halo3 was sick mcnasty. And Reach is awesome. I haven't got around to Halo4 yet.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	Reach was one of my favorite Halo campaigns, easy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	Reach is da bomb and Halo 4 is just a beast.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	I'm looking forward to Halo4 for sure. Just haven't had the time yet. too busy with work these days! The past 7 years has been brutal with my job; I'm so far behind on my gaming that it's stupid. I have like 30 backlog titles sitting on my shelf unopened, lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	I can't wait to see an XB1 Halo that really takes advantage of the available processing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/01/10/halo-spartan-assault-xbox-one-review	I really liked the campaigns for Halo. BUT, the online just seems like there is way too much stuff going on. Just like COD (although, no comparison) how there is a billion perks a hundred killstreak rewards and mediocre guns. Maybe just too much for my brain. Maybe I just suck.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	"Got it for free in February through XBox Live: Games With Gold.  Gotta say, this review is way off.  

First:  It uses the old-school approach of ""Try, Die, Repeat"" - something many of us grew up with.  I guess the reviewer would rather the game be a no-lose, no-die deal.  Everyone wins and everyone is special.  Right.

Second:  Max is a sequel to a game IGN had actually reviewed called Max & The Magic Marker.  I would expect a reviewer to do their homework.  I suppose that's asking too much.

Third:  I felt the controls were fine.  Sure, it takes a bit to get used to, but it's hardly unwieldy.

Fourth:  No double-jump?  Fall too far and you die?  Heaven forbid!  It's almost like this is a regular kid, rather than a Rayman.  That said, the controls to climb, run, swing, and jump work well.

Fifth:  Yes, it's not very long.  The nice thing is, you can go back to any level to find any secrets or eyes you missed.  That's called replayability.  Too bad you didn't mention that.

Last:  This game was co-developed for the XBox 360, XBox One, and PC.  It looks far better than its charming prequel, but it's not a next-gen game.  Don't expect it to push the envelope of a next-gen system.  It looks good for an XBox 360 game, so it's good enough."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	No mention that this is a sequel?  For shame.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	I love this game. 6 a bit low in my opinion. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	Not as good as the previous one, but still a very good game, I play it several times already.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	Thank you commenters for the reviews. I bought this because of you all for less than 4 bux today on sale! Thanks!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	Yup, I agree with those below. I was hooked when I started this and loved every minute of it. I was determined to get every achievement and enjoyed it thoroughly from beginning to end. I would rate it 9/10 personally. It's just the kind of game I enjoy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	How can you criticize this game so much? Although I saw your review I instantly bought it cause I know how stupid sometimes reviews can be.Played the first world,love it.Did they not pay you for a good review?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	I actually really enjoyed this game. It's not a next-gen experience, but as far as just being a good platformer, without a doubt. I would have given it at least a 7.5 out of 10. I would have loved this on Wii U. It could have made great use of the Gamepad.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	"I have now replayed this game after playing the ""almighty"" LIMBO and being able to compare the two, and I unabashedly declare that Max is the better game. By far. It's puzzles are more clever, the pace of the game is better thought out and more interesting with the addition of new powers, and the game looks beautiful.
Max: 9/10"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	I agree with you. I like Limbo, but it was still missing something.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	"Absolutely agree! I loves Max Curse of the Brotherhood. In all honesty, it felt like i was playing a Pixar movie. This is just one of those games that for some reason scored much lower with critics that it did with actual gamers.
I was actually shocked when I listened to this review after playing it as I didn't have any of the problems this reviewer spoke of in regards to controls. In fact, I thought it was one of the better controlled games I had played in some time. I didn't get frustrated at all in this game. Not to mention, none of the other people I know that played it had issues with control. Personally, I think this is a case of the gamer's skill being the problem and not the controls. Again, I had no problems at all with the controls."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	"This game is really fun. I don't know why they gave it a 6? It's a unique platformer what do you mean it's not next gen -_- Plus the inks are skill based, so putting ""it's frustrating that you can only use so much ink"" is totally unprofessional of you; because it's part of the challenge. If you can use all the inks in the world then you'll just storm through the entire game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/23/max-the-curse-of-brotherhood-review	WAY too harsh of a review. I'd give this game at least a 7.5. It's very enjoyable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/16/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-freedom-cry-review	Free on PSN
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/16/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-freedom-cry-review	Here's my honest 3 years late review of Assassin's Creed: Freedom Cry @ http://www.thelategamer.com/video-game-review/pc/late-assassins-creed-freedom-cry-review/
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/16/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-freedom-cry-review	A generous assessment. Game play is scripted to death and the controls for your character are awful. Theres also a lack of hints and insights at times making it very hard to know what you are supposed to do next. Oh and don't get me started on the annoying Uplay login.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	I have one code for peggle 2 if anyone is interested msg me. First Come First Serve!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	@IplayGameZ Still giving it out?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	I was going to buy it, until I found out there's no local multiplayer mode.  This type of game totally appeals for couch play, no idea why they didn't implement it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	Yeah the light bar is a really cool touch on the PS4 version. Also relatively easy platinum trophy. At least for Peggle junkies like me
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	Is Ryan a brony?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	1 Year later is always better them never, glad I have bought consoles.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	Game is just not very fun. How this earned a 9.0 while games like Geo Wars 3 get below 8s is beyond me, but ok.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/09/peggle-2-review	Played first game - was not impressed and don't understand what was all that hype about. It OK game. But not more than that.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	Great game Always improving. I jumped leaps and bound even  from last year when i recorded it on YouTube  https://www.youtube.com/user/MidNightStorm55
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	No paywall actually, all gear drops in game. It's become my go to game as I always have room to improve and build upon my character and the combat is excellent.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	They need to re-review this game it has come a long way.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	"I have to say these are best weapons right now.
Ogris/paris prime
vaykor marelok
Galantine/kroken/glaive prime/every prime melee"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	I kick Some butt with Lvl 90's on my butt and gone to 80. Very scary and Lunatic mode fore meh.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	Then you never played events that reward with Prenium weapons.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	One word. BULL**** YOU ARE FREAKING MEDIOCRE AND ONLY PLAYED BEFORE MR 2. YOU NEVER HEARD OF CREDITS BEFORE AND YOU CAN GET IT IN LVLS. AND YOU CAN GET EVERY SINGLE WEAPON IN THE ****ING GAME THROUGH TRADE,Buying, farming, events AND CRAFTING. YOU ARE A NOOB.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	I know right? Destiny as 7.8? THATS GENEROUS SURE THE GRAPICS ARE A LITTLE BREATHTAKING BUT REALLY WARFRAME SHOULD BE DESERVING 8.5 THESE LITTLE MAMA****ERS ARE NOOBS NEVER PLAYING AT LEAST HALF OF THE FREAKING GAME. AND THEY SAID AGRESSIVE BUYING? DONT THEY KNOW MR 2 IS TRADING AND TRADING CAN REWARD PLAT LIKE WTF PLAY AGAIN AND GIVE US A 2nd FREAKING LEGIT REVIEW.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	Actually, he played only to next to the second boss Jackal in Venus. And yes i am pissed off. IGN needs to play games at least HALFWAY AT LEAST before they COMMENT on a VIDEO GAME.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/04/warframe-review-2	"WTF... Even my friend tried to play and he said the same thing, But when he described it, he didnt play far enough. IGN, I know where you are at right now on that game. Venus. Here is my opinion.


9.7.


This game is a sci-fi shooter with a non far third person shooter. Fighting aliens (infested) Rest are humans basicaly you have to rebalance the solar system. I played on PS4 and this Is better than destiny! it has more levels.


THE VERDICT

""Warframe tips the scales too far in one direction. The core gameplay, including the variety of suits and weapons, is terrific, and it’s reason enough to play this sci-fi shooter. But the boring story, too-similar missions, and aggressive payment model hold it back from what it could be. Still, if you plan to pick it up, it’s worth dropping $60 and pretend there’s nothing else to it.""

Aggressive payment model? its like you are saying games are not worth waiting for. You should of Studied it closer before writing this piece of crap.

Your attemps at game reviewing are so mediocore that even i have to look away. You havent even got to the part about clans, trading PLATINUM IS A OPTION TO BUY. LIKE CMON. All the things i did i never spent money. You need to first go to market then warframe blueprints then beat the bosses for them. Craft all three parts build the overall. The excellent variety even has bows, swords, guns, bowguns, crossbows, boss weapons, pistols, Rocket launchers that you dont have to carry on your shoulder. etc. In conclusion. This game deserves more plays and positives. The game itself i admit its not perfect but in time it will get more and more fun and one day, It will revolutionize gaming and you wont have anything to say about it since your reviews are LAME."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/dc-universe-online-review-2	"Careful when you play this awful game. Daybreak Games (the makers) like to charge you for ""non-refundable"" fees when you least expect it. BEWARE"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/dc-universe-online-review-2	"My verdict on this game: Absolutely GOD AWEFUL. I'll still play it, as I enjoy the concept, and don't get me wrong; it could've been amazing, but the execution fell flat on it's face!
I don't do competitive or technical terms, so I'll say 3 things about it.
1. You can't lose in the opening. Sure, this might seem like a good idea, make the new players who are bad at the game feel good about themselves! But as soon as they leave that area they're going to dive head first into a group of enemies and die, a lot.
2. The difficulty has no curve. By the time I got to Circe's mission (Giganta), I was dying in two or three hits without any explanation. I had gone back and grinded to 3 level above what most people were and STILL got my ass handed to me within ten seconds.
3. The AI and the Targeting systems... oh boy. Most older games get AI wrong, usually the friendly kind, but DCUO takes it too far. The AI will OCCASIONALLY target non-player allies and attack them. You enter a room full of both enemies and allies and most of the enemies that see you will attack you. The targeting, meanwhile, makes no sense. Press LB or L1 to target? All it does is rotate my camera! And LT/L2 just targets the enemy furthest away!
If you ask me, DCUO should be shut down and given a complete overhaul, because right now (Excuse my next line for its vulgarity) the game is a pile of fucking shit!
3/10 Because I enjoy the concept."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/dc-universe-online-review-2	"Small addition:
Equipment breaks too easily. I used a staff for 1 quest and it was bought from the Hall of Supervillains Bank. I started using my FISTS mid-fight against Panarchos lo/Io. Unbelievable how much is wrong there."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/dc-universe-online-review-2	The game has some very fun elements to it, the one thing that kills me is the community. I play with my daughter, who loves the DC Universe, but her and i feel it next to impossible to accomplish quests because every single individual within a close radius swoops in at every second to steal what we need to move on. Social chat has the charm of a trashy, run down strip club in the ghettos of Tampa, FL. There doesn't seem to be any player interested in immersing themselves in the DC Universe judging by the names and the behaviors seen. That's just my two cents.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/dc-universe-online-review-2	Unless you join an online community that shares your interest this is typical behavior from people you meet online. UNFORTUNATELY. I recommend you do some simple searching and it shouldn't be too hard to find one. I recently joined one for the DIVISION and it's pretty significant how much different it is to play with a like-minded group than being at the mercy of random online players. Good luck to you and your daughter.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/02/dc-universe-online-review-2	"I don't know about everyone else, but I'm always finding bugs and glitches. The game also has the problem of putting vary few items that you need for quest in the public area so you're always fighting someone else for them. Half of the time the map makes missions look jumbled and have cut a lot of the stuff out, just adding to the city maps would fix it easily IMO. There's also just all of the small stuff that just doesn't make sense, feels extremely cramped inside and out, and it can get really repetitive and of course it's a freemium game so I don't have much hope for it.
I believe that City of Heroes and Villains is the gold standard that super H/V games should strive for."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/26/battlefield-4-xbox-one-review	My saving was gone. Now I have to start the previous mission in order to get to the current one. Disappointing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/26/battlefield-4-xbox-one-review	Currently £3.75 on deals with gold, dont mind if I do.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/26/battlefield-4-xbox-one-review	Shittiest campaign I've ever played. Not even 2 hours into the gameplay and ive incountered MULTIPLE glitches. Even playing now. Why was this not fixed? Poorly put together. Thumbs down. Would never recommend someone to play this campaign.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/26/battlefield-4-xbox-one-review	@Alpha327Reggie yeah, I'm only doing it for the achievements. it is fucking shit.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/zoo-tycoon-review	Do you know what REALLY ANNOYS ME!! It is having to sit through a 29 second advert to watch 22 seconds of content!!! Stop being so damn greedy, IGN
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	granted its a bad game, but that guy just cant play right it looks not that hard to me.  First off, and I know its october 2015 this is a dead article but I gotta say this.  In the menu's dont put your arm all the way straight when scrolling.  keep it flexed and then when you want to select said item, give your fist a quick jerk, works everytime.  The fighting style was bad, but mainly when you get done with the combo, and its time to do the push thing, you have to actually push in and out all the way like you are doing a bench press standing up, the guy in the video was just flapping his hands around with the arms completely straightened.  In Kinect games, I have found you have to overexaggerate your movements.  like really get into it full everything.  otherwise, it wont register.  Ok I feel better now.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	The cops are on high alert after that last job, we have to stay low for a bit. Call me when you see this.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	Worst than Sonic Boom. \U0001f604
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	This is the second worst reviewed game ever on gamerankings after Charlie's Angels, lol.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	I've never really complained about dialogue, but this game takes the award, even indie developers write something hundreds of times better. I am not sure who at Ubisoft approved it. It can be fun when the Kinect actually responds. Ironically, my favorite Kinect game has been Deepak Chopra's Leela on Xbox 360.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	The Gunstringer would be mine. Very underrated and also arguably one of the most original exclusives Xbox 360 has to offer.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	It looks really cool.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	just bought fighter within today and you don't need to navigate the menus with kinect, i use the controller. Fighter within is competitively awesome!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	How do I throw??
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	boxing moves and lean back to power up moves
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	This game should work with a controller. WHAT THE FUCK WERE THEY THINKING?!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	What a horrible game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/22/the-fighter-within-review	kinect is a shit house
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	" Finally got around to playing this once it was free and I was floored. This game is amazing. This review calls the story ""interesting""; try gripping, thrilling, or terrific. It felt like I was reading a good book or watching a movie whenever the cut scenes happened. The combat is simple, with hidden depths, visceral, and very satisfying. We should be talking about how excited we are the the second or third game in the series, not marveling at how thoroughly every major gaming outlet dropped the ball when it came time to review the first one. After this, I'm not going to bother with reviews anymore. These people CLEARLY don't know what the hell they're talking about. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	"gave this a go while its free, but this review doesnt hit many of the issues with the game.

firstly, the cutscenes. now i like a good cinematic as much as anyone else to give us some story, but at least give us the option to SKIP the cutscenes. i want to play the game not sit and watch a mini movie every 5mins.

secondly, the on screen prompts. tell us how to do everything at the beginning and then never bother us again. dont interrupt battles midway through just to tell us A means block.

thirdly, the camera needs to be further out or higher up. i dont want to finish off an enemy up close and then not be able to see where i am going before running straight into another group of 3 barbarians.

fourthly, the upgrade system is just too confusing. they either use long winded explanations for simple things like ""bonus health/focus capsules (wtf is a capsule or focus)"", or they give us no explanation such as the combat or execution upgrades. do i need to trigger the new executions in combat with certain button presses or are they randomly generated? nothing that tells me exactly what i need to know."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	Finally played the game since it's free this month I always wanted to play but I never did probably because of all the bad reviews it got when it was released, I have to say I'm ashamed that the stupid reviews everywhere almost made never play it what an amazing beautiful game its not perfect it did had some gameplay problems boss fight gets annoying but the overall game the characters, environment, story, voice actors, it was amazing I would give it at least an 8 and I can't understand the hate it got
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	Free with gold now. It's worth a try imo https://youtu.be/KjBoIgbcAAE
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	It's free as part of Games with Gold now. Definitely worth a look: https://youtu.be/KjBoIgbcAAE
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	Can someone list the exclusives for xbox one other then this one? im gonna be getting an s  and i dont know what games to get and this is a real question no trolling
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	@gamer4f165744e4b0a I got S lately and I'm going to get Halo Master Chief Collection and Quantum Break :-) I suppose this one is another exclusive, and whole Forza series, and Gears of War? ;-) I'm also an XBox noob, but these 5 series are something I recognize
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	I picked this one up on steam for about 5 bucks and I was thoroughly impressed. I disagree with many of the things that you say put it down. Every boss added something fresh the combat and game-play, after every boss there were new enemies to fight, along with the attacks the past bosses used given to regular infantry. I couldn't get enough of the story and was genuinely dumbfounded by the ending of Marius' story. At the very least this beautiful spectacle earns an 8.5/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	Hmm, on sale for PC for $5.  I suppose that's a good price.  Surprised it hasn't been a GWG title.  Unless I missed it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	6.8? 4/10 from gamespot? No efin way. I just bought and x1 like 4months ago and picked this up brand new off ebay for $9....its easily a 8/10 game, graphics are the best that ive seen on xbox 1. I am sure because i own every single xbox one exclusives out there.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/ryse-son-of-rome-review	10/10 perfect game. Makes gta v look like big rigs over the road racing
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/21/injustice-gods-among-us-ultimate-edition-review	"5.99 USD on PSN for PS4.   Sale is almost over.   Worth it I guess to kill the next few expendable hours I have in my day before SFV comes out tomorrow.   Thanks for the review and good lookin' out on giving props to the PS4 D-Pad.   Tried playing SF4 on someone elses Xbox360 once.    Couldn't pull off a single Hadouken.  And a shoryureppa?  Forget about it.  PS44Life.
Ah, who knows, maybe SFV won't be all that bad on the XBone.   Wait, what?   Oh, Really?    Hahhahahahahhahha"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/20/need-for-speed-rivals-review	I miss the stories that they used to put in these games. It gives racing games way more replay value for me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/20/need-for-speed-rivals-review	@doctrtuba I recently started up NfS:Most Wanted on my 360 (originally played on the PS2).  Forgot how corny the story was, but that is part of the fun.  Bonus:  Josie Moran is hot...

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	I have to agree that it would be awesome if Nintendo would equip a true hardcore difficulty to all platformers and games published by the company. Mario world like most Nintendo games is built around coop and the sp experience would be much more enjoyable with a higher difficulty. The game is still one of the best experiences offered this generation and feel bad for those who have yet to experience The wii u.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	Ya, it's so weird the wii u didn't sell very good but you rarely find anyone who has one ever make a complaint about it. I don't have one mostly because I've never gotten into Mario games. Although the Mario maker game is making me re consider it. I also get pissed at snot nosed punks at GameStop or Walmart that give dirty looks or smirks when you buy something they don't approve of. I bought a collectors edition of corpse party for the vita and the idiot behind the counter snickers at me. What do people care what you buy? If you don't like a certain game or platform then don't get it. Why care if someone you don't know buys it. To each his own I say
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	this game feels a bit like its for baby's i don't find this game at all challenging the levels are way too easy the music does not match marios personality its an ok game i suppose much prefer mario galaxy
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	@alpha_male Yeah it's disappointing Nintendo doesn't give higher difficulties for the hardcore gamers. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	"@alpha_male  @Oblivion246 dude, it has the hardest thing called ""Champion's Road"" .... that level is harder than Dark Souls New Game++ (which I had conquered) .... 

I died 600++ times on that level...  and finished it through luck... OMG that's the best/ hard/ frustating platforming level ever! 

I took a holiday in gaming after completing that level (never again).... 
remember:  ""Champion's Road"" ..... it's the last level on this game.. ULTIMATE CHALLENGE (finish it with Mario Not bringing Power UP from other level) ..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	Yeah, that level's the toughest thing I've ever tried (not yet completed it).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	haqhahahaha BAM
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	and posting on a video gaming website....
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	"Hmm. I know what you mean. All of the video games I am currently playing are really very violent. I'm actually looking at prices for either a wii u or new 3ds (love handheld rpgs...new inazuma coming).
Unfortunately the two games I am looking forward to; phantom pain (will probably deal with violence creatively, or make some statement) and gran turismo have largely informed my console decisions.
Only had the disposable to justify the purchase of one at the time....went with one of the 'big two'....don't regret that.
Am now looking to relax with a little bit of what you referred to. Dunno how i'll go.
EDIT: Probably the ds for the rpgs....but.....new xenoblade and zelda.....ugh......I can't decide.
SECOND EDIT: The witcher made me genuinely depressed at times. Which was effective. But ugh. I popped in GTA V and just did doughnuts in the sand in a vapid dominator while looking at the sun. With that relatively happy music station on. It made me feel better. But then unfortunately i clipped a lady when leaving, she went under the vehicle and i felt bad again hahahaha.
THIRD EDIT: Lulz. Basically it was reading this review.....looking at your post and thinking...yeah, i would like to play something bright and colouful whilst still being a 'good game'. Before sep 1st when some really crazy/sad/angry violent stuff occurs. Actually i should get a wii-u or 3ds before then."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	You're also going to miss The Division, Mortal Kombat X, Until Dawn, Uncharted (2016), Battlefront, among other great indies you'll never find on Wii U. I like some Nintendo games but the Wii U just can't hold it's own. And is NOT worth 299$, more like 150$ Then again I'm almost 40 so I don't watch cartoons, or like a lot of child based games. But to each their own. I must confess DK Country TF looks great, but I would never pay that much for ONE game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	As long as you don't have kids and major responsibilities I think it's cool. But overall after your over 30, I think you should be doing other, more constructive things. Like going on vacation. I use to game with my wife, and she got so caught up in it, she became very LAZY, while I worked my butt off. Call me a killjoy, but I just can't get heavily into gaming anymore. Then again I'm almost 40.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	"Umm, cool? I'm 31, and even though I don't have kids, I have more than enough responsibilities on my plate. I run two small businesses and I recently decided to go back to school full-time to finish my masters degree in computer science, and my wife has a stacked schedule as an administrator at a very busy doctor's office/immediate care, so spending our extremely valuable time and money doing ""constructive"" things like... going on vacation (lol seriously?)... isn't a very realistic option, at least not on any kind of regular basis.


When I said ""countless hours"", I meant over the course of two years. We don't have endless time to sit around and play games, but once or twice a week, we like to cut loose and play games together in the evenings when we're done with everything we HAVE to do. It's just a cheap way to have some spontaneous fun that doesn't require driving across town in search of entertainment. Not that any of that is your business, but since you brought it up, there it is. Also, this is a gaming site, not yahoo parenting or something, so talking about the games people play is the entire point. But thanks for passing judgement on me four months after the fact."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	"Been looking into getting a PS4, but i am just not that turned on with the games they are pushing out on that platform. They're all so predictably violent FPS and the like. Meanwhile, i decided, ""hey, lets see what Nintendo is up to..."" and holy geez I am so happy to see the Wii U has some good games! I just love Nintendo's joyous approach to videoGAMES. This is what i want to come home to, some joyous silliness instead of getting blown up in gory shootouts."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	I bought a Wii u just after buying a ps4,ps4 was such a letdown.I can honestly say I've had an amazing time with my Wii u,super Mario 3d world is amazing,and so is donkey Kong.I just completed donkey Kong for the second time last week,and it made me smile the whole time playing.Such an amazing game.I'm now on rayman legends and that's another class game.I'm usually a battlefield player,but I've put down bf4 these days,and my Wii u has brought me so much fun.And I'm no Nintendo fanboy,hated the Wii,an awful machine,but Wii u is and was worth every penny.£180 well spent
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/super-mario-3d-world-review	"It does seem like the place to go dude. I'm not so sure committing to a groupon is risk free, but go ahead if you think it's a good deal.
Otherwise, yeah I guess we'll just show up and see what happens. It sounds like just the saunas and cold baths are enough. So if that's just general admission, without the platza, I'm cool with that shit.
And really, depending on how hungover we are, we could go there and just swear it all out first thing of the day. Hah.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/battlefield-4-ps4-review	I was considering buying this on PS4, but seeing the disclaimer in this article: are these problems not fixed yet?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/battlefield-4-ps4-review	"Just got a PS4 that came with Battlefront Star Wars I was excited until I played the game. Its horrible its looks beautiful but no real content. So I looked around for some other ""Next Gen Shooters"" tried Rainbow Six Siege also lacking in content. Went to Black OPS 3 and it felt like I was playing a cartoon. So I went back to Battlefield which I previously owned on ps3 and 3 years later this game blows even the latest COD out of the water. The depth of this game is phenomenal. The graphics are insanely gorgeous, and the multiplayer is one of the most rewarding experiences you will ever have in online play. Play 64 player Conquest and you will literally feel like you are on a real battlefield. Or scale it down and play 16 v 16 team death match. Either way you will have an amazing experience."

NEVER LIKED COD IN THE PAST BUT WAS WILLING TO GIVE IT A SHOT...BUT COULDNT GET OVER THE ""CARTOONYNESS"" OF THE GAME. LOOKS LIKE BF4 WINS IN EVERY CATEGORY EVEN THOUGH IT'S 2 YEARS OLDER THAN COD. BOUGHT IT ON EBAY FOR $18, STOKED!! NEEDED THIS REVIEW TO FEEL SATISFIED ABOUT THE DECISION"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/19/battlefield-4-ps4-review	Best online shooter of all time, period.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	"This game sucks.

Golf games are about mastering a small skillset that enable you to perform better and better as your gear and skills improve. It's the improvement and bettering your score and performance that is so satisfying.

Powerstar turns this whole process on its head by substituting improved skills with consumable ""boosters"". I don't know how an entire company managed to develop this to completion without realizing that they were destroying the precision = reward formula that is really at the heart of golf games and golf itself.

It's tantamount to designing a bowling game and making ""accuracy"" a consumable that you have to purchase separately.

Want to be able to hit 300 yards? Buy a booster! Want a phenomenal spin? Buy a booster! Why you could be the best. All you have to do is buy lots and lots of boosters.

It's an insult to golf games. I really wanted to like it because it was the first ""three-click"" golf game I've seen on the Xbox. That's its only redeeming quality."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	"It's now ""free"" on the One. Which really means you can get a free trial, and buy the rest of the game in separate DLCs, so the full game isn't really ""free"". It's like what they did with Killer Instinct."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	Ready for more courses and tournament challenges that everyone is equal as far as the equipment used is involved... don't need one guy hitting 400 yard drives and everyone else pooping out 250...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	Fun, except when it isn't ie putting. Never had so many fucking balls lip out
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	Hit the putt too hard ;)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	"Sunk tons of hours in. They need to build off its success and sell more courses. Plus online play. Add those things this is a 9.0 golf game easy.
Also needs 2-4 players option for the career modes."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	Im addicted to this game. Even though it's an arcade game, it's quite a bit more challenging than most golf sims (especially EA golf).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	Not sure about all this no multiplayer stuff, I've played multiplayer its great. My buddy and I could even just use one (or two if you want) controller and we played against eachother and two online people's scores so when I beat him he still did better than someone (lessens the blow) this game is so legit I don't play golf irl and have no desire but introducing what feels like an mmo loot system, gear sets, stats, and competing with all your friends scores at all times makes this game addictive and a must play. I feel like I'm playing multiplayer at all times competing with friends best scores. The game is a 9.3 to me. More courses and characters would make it a 10 but for the money its worth it and there is so much content if you try to gold every challenge
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	No multiplayer support!?! WTF were they thinking!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	"I went to the midnight launch and got Fifa (which I'd played religiously on 360) and battlefield 4. I also had £75 of Microsoft points. I bought Forza, golf and put an extra £2 to get all the characters on Killer Instinct.
For some strange reason I find myself having one game of forza, one of FIFA and another on B4. My hours are actually being spent on this quick, easy to play,(put down) arcade golf game. Very addictive and accurate. Love the rivals, top game. In fact gonna have another go even tho its 3am"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/powerstar-golf-review	Wow is that fun? I love hot shots golf would U recommend the game?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	Season One was great. Since Double Helix left the game has turned to shit. It looks shitty, it plays shitty, it's dumbed the fuck down, buggy, buggy, buggy. Iron Galaxy has no idea what they're doing. I wish a more deserving development team was the main dev team on this game. They don't cut it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	I'm so stoked for Season 3! Fight on!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	"Unfair gameplay? In other words: You suck.
Not only are every character unique, but KI is arguably one of (if not THE) most balanced fighting game out there. Evo this year proved that, as the top 8 finalist were ALL different characters, no one played with the same characters. There are no noob/spam characters, there are no tournament favorites or god-tier fighters."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	Really?!? The graphics are UGLY! I've never seen a more unpolished game in my entire life!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	"You have no idea what you're talking about. The graphics in KI are superb, especially the framerate, which is visually locked at 60fps but which the engine is capable of running up to 90fps.
Having said that, if you're choosing your fighting games based on graphics, then you're wrong."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	Unfinished? It's an endless ecosystem, there is no final version, one game for one entire console generation, continuously expanding and having content added over time. That is the plan anyway, things could change in the future.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/18/killer-instinct-review	Can they PLEASE do something to upgrade the bleeding graphics? They look REALLY bad as they leak across the screen during their battle animations.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	"Odd review this. I was put off this game when it came out due to reviews like this. 

Just downloaded it for my son to play as it was cheap in the store, and he loves it. Yes, its not the most complex of games and it is restrictive in its linear game play,  but the graphics are nice and colourful, its engaging with some solid variation, and some interesting, but simple puzzles - it introduces to a young audiences game mechanics that experienced gamers know well.

It's clearly marketed at younger audiences and it delivers superbly on that front. I suspect the reviewer didn't take this in to consideration well."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	Honestly im scratching my head at this review, and a bit confused on what the writer must think a fun game is? I love knack. I just got it and played 3 straight hours last night and there want a dull moment where I wanted to turn it off. Its very engaging and just purely fun. I think the story is great! The graphics are beautiful and the controls are simple as pie. Its a easy game overall but its just FUN. That's something video games are missing these days in large part... Games are generally so detailed, gfx oriented, challenging and complicated that you can't just sit back and feel like you are just having fun. Its like the person who wrote this review was just trying to shit on this great game for some reason? This game sort of reminds me of the fun I had playing games on my nes and snes just from the standpoint that I felt very entertained engaged and joyful while playing knack. I am thrilled a p2 is coming out soon. Its the best game I have played on ps4 so far. Ign should really have ppl who enjoy the genre or type of game they are writing about to do their reviews. I like the camera angles in this game alot and I never felt lost once. With many games made in our time, you may kill a few enemies and since u can walk anywhere u want you may end up 10 miles away from your mission and you end up not advancing the story. You get lost. But in knack the story keeps unfolding rapidly as you play. the developers intended it that way and I am very glad. Its the opposite of disengaging. What was this reviewer thinking? Knack is a awesome game. People should really play this game themselves and come to a conclusion. Im sure most people will enjoy knack. As the majority of comments here reflect.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	Just picked this up. Lol. I absolutely loved it. One of the best platformers I have played in awhile. Playing it on hard mode and I've died quite a few times (And I love and play dark souls games). The story plays out like an awesome animated film. Love everything about it. And the fact that you can get content from chests here and there definitely gives it a high replayability. Highly recommend it if you love old ps2 platformers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	Just picked up a PS4 and this is one of the games I picked up. My five year old and myself are enjoying this game. If you are looking to introduce younger kids to games this is a great ace to start.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	Knack is the greatest game of this generation.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	played this in eb games its not bad i gave it a 6.5 out of ten Like come on its fun if you have a friend tell him to play this game with u 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	"Pretty much only worth one play through. Fighting is atrocious and random items in chests means you'll have to replay the game multiple time just to collect everything as it will continue giving you tons of crystals you don't or ever will need. Awful.
Most of the rest of the game is alright. The constant cut scenes are used to load up your next stretch and they number far too many."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	Knack is cute and original. It had great potential to be much more remarkable, but the plot and the linear scenarios put me off a bit Indeed, it would`ve been better if the game didn`t prompt us to transform Knack at the designers` will. I guess GTA 5`s brutal open world slap in my face with such marvellous visuals and possibilities blurred my true opinion about Knack or smth.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/knack-review	"Finally played this game for the first time. Ehh it wasn't terrible but was not great. The review is spot on. For $10 I'll live. This game has a lot of potential. A great concept but it's hampered with slow controls, fetch a hidden part 1 of 5 that not likely will be able to use before the end of the game. I was able to complete two items and found them to be quite useless. It's unfortunate it's got ""Launch"" written all over this game. Definitely rushed. My biggest complaint is it's a typical Sony platformer in the movement department. I hate their jump to ledge issues. One of these days I hope they can make a character jump up to a ledge and make it on the first try. Again, this game had potential but it fell flat. I'm not gonna miss the combat though. Fighting was ass. That was awful lol!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	Just finally finished campaign, good but shit next to 2 and 3
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	I'm playing through it now. Just escape from prison and thus far it's my favourite killzone game in the series.d
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	There was just something i didn't like about it. Perhaps I was too invested in the characters from the older games and found this entry to be a bit random.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	@bridges7 I can understand that, it is pretty different from the previous games. Really love the art design and variety in the environments. And the cold war backdrop is pretty interesting to me.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	Multiplayer is still, still going strong .
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	Multiplayer is still going strong too!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	Killzone: Shadow Fall's story is far more interesting than the cliched and lazy AI goes rogue bullshit in Halo 5.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	This is on sale for $5 right now. Good excuse to try it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	Totally. I've been waiting for a serious sale for a long time, and this is it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	And yet I found myself at the add to cart button like would I rather play this or get some subway..
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	"@sneakerhead252 @lydianfanfare I feel even if it's only okay, $5 is still a hard price to be pissed off about. 

I don't think I'd buy this game otherwise but seems like a worthy gamble. "
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	@FatboyFresh Just saw it on the store, and thought the same myself. Im really happy with my purchase. Did you buy it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	@mripichon Yup. Got it last night but haven't had a chance to play it yet. Maybe tonight. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	I just wish it had an option to use the PS move. Killzone 3 was so good with it. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	"This is a broken game. Even when patched. Promising start, but the faults soon appear.
-worst is that the game sometimes creates checkpoint into a place from where you cannot get out of. Not even with the droids help. And then, the only way to escape, is to start the level from beginning. ARGH!
Also, the game allows you to slide to death, when you are using the droid rope, as you are allowed to attach the rope even to places that will cause you to fall to your death.
With patience, you might work around these issues,  but I do not really have that patience."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	I love this game!  I just bought it and it's the best PS4 game I have by far.  Fun, fun, fun! I need to get Uncharted 4 & Infamous though.  I just got a PS4 in September so yes I am extremely late to the party.  But out of my six games this game takes the cake.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/killzone-shadow-fall-review	Great game. I got it at launch with my ps4. I would give it a 8.5/10.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/flower-ps4-review	To me, this game is average. Yes, it's gorgeous looking (at least, the first couple of levels), but for me there was no challenge, no sense of accomplishment, and no spiritual journey. I liked the first couple of levels, but it was downhill from there. Perhaps too artistic for my taste.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/13/flower-ps4-review	Lmao all these bois criticizing a game they haven't played because of the concept

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	Why NBA 2K14 Was a Masterpiece Game in 2013 Because in My Career You went to the Rookie Showcase and you get Drafted to any Team in the NBA on Next-Gen And What makes this game even more Amazing is When They Launch A New Game Mode That Was MyPark And You Can Play With Your Myplayer online in my park and The My Career Storyline was amazing because you Had Different Cutscenes in The Game. The Gameplay Was Amazing and The Presention Was a Masterpiece So NBA 2K14 Was a Amazing Basketball Game in 2013
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	I love when people like you actually think this is a relevant thing to tell someone who's having trouble with their teammate AI.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	Show me your ways! I'm playing for the Jazz and they're awful. So inconsistent. Don't take open shots half the time when I pass to them either. A big part is the ball's physics problem though like he said...so many passes placed in really irrational spots considering where the teammates actually are on the court.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	my 1st com
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	I personally love this game I am not having any issues with the servers (PS4), my team mates AI is not bad, I play it on Allstar difficulty and won the title my rookie season going 66-16 winning MVP and leading the league in scoring blocks and steals and I played every game, in my 2nd season I am 53-4 and leading the league in scoring, Fg%, 3p%, Steals, and Blocks while averaging almost 9 rebounds and 8 assist a game.I play 8 min quarters. I don't if some of you are just really bad or what. To me this game is easily a 9.0/10 I agree with the review 100%. If anyone wants to play this or any other ps4/ps3 games feel free to add me OmegaStorm84.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	"This is one of the worst games of this year. The graphics are good, thats about it.
We only have access to 2 game modes.... My Career, My GM.. and online which is down half the time.
My career... Your team is useless on both ends of the floor, when they are not giving up 3s every possession they are standing there doing nothing on offense. While the other teams AI is Michael Jordan.
My GM is decent, if there was association in the game i wouldn't be complaining but since this is the ONLY game mode we have why the hell can't we play it with multiple people?
The park is the best thing they did but since there isn't any fouls its a cluster fuck of people spamming steal which turns it into this ball hogging game of cheese 9 out of 10 games.
Gameplay needs reworking there is no reason why a pass i make should have a % chance to just go flying out of bounds. Make it so i have to aim my passes like NHL. No one likes getting butt fucked by RNG and fix the fucking moving screens, why does the AI go off screens before they are even set to cheese you?... Jesus Christ 2K.
Overall just wait for 2k15, unless you like unfinished games.
2.5/10, Uncompleted cash grab."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	Just reminds me of how shitty 2k13 was, every character has a magnet that no matter whether it's a teammate or rival will cause you to collide and slow you down, AI is shit, dunk contest was boring af, controls are jerky and useless.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	The server is horrible.. The game is useless without the server. Its a major disappointment.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	Agreed. it blows my mind how useless it is. I have it on PS4 and the error log for it is filled with the game crashing. It can take up to 12 minutes for my roster to download just to use it and then the game crashes as soon as the tip-off is about t begin. had to restart it 3 times last night just to play a exhibition game with the default roster. Really disappointed with 2K.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	This game is fu**ing awesome. Best Nba2k game ever!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	8,9! Even the writer does not believe it...2k is sharing its bucks, obviously
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	"Aaaarrrggghhhh!!! This game is f@cking frustrating. WHEN it works, it's great. I've had it four days and all I do is play exhibition games with my brother and that only works half the time.
Not being able to save your edited rosters to your hard drive is retarded. I spent a couple of hours working on my roster only to have it overwritten back to the default roster. It looks awesome and plays well enough, if not for my love of Basketball I would turf this game.
So many BASIC things are missing from this game like the ability to to set double teams in the match-up screen.
2K really dropped the ball and all they're going to to do is dick about and string us along till they release 2K15."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	Do you have it on PS4 or Xbox One?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	In my case (I dont know if u were asking me), PS4 (I also have it on PS3...and I play it on PS3, seriously). I play all star level. Dont take me wrong,its a good game, just playability (maybe I suck) is a bit harder in PS4 when wires somewhere burn.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	"I absolutely agree. And it also is very frustrating when playing the machine it suddenly ""decides"" you cannot make a shot while Ariza or someone else like that becomes magically the next Magic Johnson or Jordan...arrrrg!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/11/nba-2k14-ps4-xbox-one-review	Trevor Ariza has been balling this year. One of the leaders in 3 pointers made I believe. If he's hurting you from deep that's on you. The Wizards in general will burn you from deep.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	The problem was for Call Of Duty Ghost is that is the ending. Its a stab in the back with the cliffhanger that end it with a disappointed. And also a Silent Protagonist. What The Hell Activision?

This really stinks of corporate sponsorship to score this game eh? What a disgrace. Clearly the WORST game in the series by far, yet ""somehow"" scored this high. Very suspect."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	@Skruffbagg if I remember correctly I think the guy who reviewed ghost  worked in Activision after the review
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	@mueed @Skruffbagg You're right, and now he works for Naughty Dog. This guy knows the right Dicks to suck to get ahead in the world...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	This game has the second best fish AI ever seen in a game after only Super Mario 64 (1996) ahahaha!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	Doesn't it bother anyone else that shooting guns in space in this game doesn't send you flying backwards due to zero gravity.

btw, this scored higher than DOOM."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	@lowcifer Not sure about IGN, but definitely Scott Lowe specifically. He got a job with Activision shortly after this bullshit review, and now works for Naughty Dog.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	So your telling me this game is as good as the original doom are you serious
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/11/05/call-of-duty-ghosts-review	Exceptional campaign? What a joke.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	 My favorite AC game after AC2 and Brotherhood. The pirate ship battles are fantastic and amazing fun!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	To much complicated. To many combinations from the keyboard. Where are the good old games? Simpler, better.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	"By Far my Favorite AC. Only one that I have replayed. Unique game in the series to the point that this should of spun off into a New IP away from AC.

Still to this day the only exceptional AAA Pirate action adventure game."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	Grabbed this over the weekend. First game I regret buying. Only a few missions in and it already feels really repetitive. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	love this game, as all of the other ac games!!!!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	never played ac before. would this be v good start on the ps4?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	"@bobbobbob69 It's a great standalone Assassin's Creed game. I recommend starting with Assassin's Creed II and moving on up from there. Part I is forgettable and SOOOOOO repetitive. Part II was the series at it's highest which started the Ezio story and Ezio lasted for 2 more sequels(Brotherhood & Revelations) then they continued/finished the Desmond story(modern day character which all the Assassin's you play as in Part I, II, Brotherhood, Revelations, and III are his ancestors) in part III. Part IV, Unity, Rogue, and Syndicate are standalone titles that have nods to the other games in the series. If you want to play all of the games(on home consoles that is) in Order or release it'd be ACI, ACII, AC BROTHERHOOD, AC REVELATIONS, ACIII, AC LIBERATION(DOWNLOAD ONLY), AC IV, AC ROGUE, AC UNITY, AND SYNDICATE THIS FRIDAY.

If you want to play in CHRONOLOGICAL ORDER OF OVERALL STORY then play ACI, ACII, AC BROTHERHOOD, AC REVELATIONS, ACIV, AC ROGUE, AC III, AC LIBERATION, AC UNITY, AND SYNDICATE FRIDAY.

However, if you didn't want to spend that much time on this game, part iv is a GREAT standalone AC title, but you'd be missing out on some great stories and characters."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	" So I recently played AC3 and Black Flag back to back.
How the majority of the Internet thinks Black Flag is a better game than AC3 is beyond me.


“The size of the world is staggering, and the fact that it's absolutely brimming with fun and rewarding activities made me want to get lost as possible as I traveled from point A to point B.” – Nothing that wasn’t already done in AC3.
Traversal is more glitchy and easily the worst in the series. AC3 controlled almost perfectly, one annoying tree here and there. Dramatically fewer than the annoying trees in AC4.
Too. Damn. Many. Collectibles. The game is a gigantic time sink of nothingness. All Assassin’s Creed can be accused of being time sinks … but at least they were fun. In AC3, it was a pleasure to run and climb on stuff because of the newer animation system. Black Flag though … is on a whole new level. The game has enough systems, but they don’t feel especially pleasant.
“Death animations are relatively short and sweet”. This is a straight lie. Animations last LONGER than in AC3 and combat feels annoying because of this. It doesn’t’ flow as good as AC3. Using 2 swords for combat is simply too much. Connor was much more versatile using a sword and a tomahawk."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	"@Acryion Oh I can see how the majority of the internet/gaming community could see AC IV Black Flag as being a better, more refined game that BUILT upon what was already done in AC3 - I personally like AC IV's story better, the enviroment (not just what we/you are exploring) but just the tone, setting - everything about ACIII was improved (or worked upon, or tweaked) whatever little cliche term you wanna throw in there.  Basically its subjective its opinion - but I COULD easily see (as most can) how AC IV black flag is a superior title to ACIII - I couldnt wait to be finished with AC3 - but with AC IV I wanted more and it is what it is.  Everything you said could be returned/ and flipped on its head and used to reference AC3 - AC3 if anything did NOT feel important or remotely enjoyable (nor as large) even IF a game is larger and you feel its a time sink then again what large open world game isnt ? AC3 ""dabs"" at the idea of open world, ACIV accomplishes it, and remember its your opinion personally I dont think a game can have ENOUGH collectibles and ANY game can be considered a time sink - but nothingness ? are we playing the same game cause it was AC3 that I was extremely bored with (from story, to side missions, to the character you played) all extremely forgettable...ACIV on the other hand I can still remember it a year later then again I played AC3 in passing on the X360 and I played ACIV on the PS4 with a new better high end flat panel UHD TV.  That is just graphical though, but for me AC2 and ACIV will always be the best 3 and 1 are too repetitive and the storylines (if ACIV is considered to have a weak main campaign/story) then my lord AC3 has a downright horrendous storyline only thing I can admit about AC3 is its ""ambition"" but like the movie: Blow w/ Johnny Depp as he states in the end (a perfect quote for this topic) ""my ambition far outweighed my talent"" you could translate that to a single video game or for that matter Ubisoft Montreal lol...but in the end its all opinion/taste - and to each their own I guess, also I could never personally get into 18 century boston and mr  connor - the american frontier my ass - on the other hand the golden age of piracy and the caribbean was just a pure blast...but as said just above it comes down to taste."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	"@Acryion And again you must be playing a different version the combat was fine for me (fluid and enjoyable) in ACIV furthermore you claim that the feels annoying...um the PS4 version felt just fine...and the animation times I just dont see that and personally as I said in last post cant.have.enough.collectibles - but again thats personal opinion but my biggest gripe with your comment is ""traversal is more glitchy and easily the worse in the series"" wow now you MUST be played a different version I had not one glitch, lag, frame rate issue ONE BIT on the PC or the PS4 version infact I would say QUITE the opposite - AC3 = like skyrim in some instances, ACIV - smoother then GTA V in almost every way imaginable thats MY experience, bigger world, smoother context and more fluid (both in and out of combat) more rewards more collectibles (which I see as a plus) and just a better setting/time period.  So in almost everyway I see ACIV as a upgrade from ACIII (and ACII had a better story then both) but I guess the version you played, and your personal taste goes alot into that, cause 99% of the people I've talked to some have only played 2-3 AC titles, some have played nearly every entry in the series but ALL seem to say the same thing that they prefer Syndicate Or ACII or ACIV as there top 3 AC titles (in any specific order)...but to each their own as I've said before everyone is different but alot of what you said I DID NOT experience in my 72 hours of playthrough in ACIV (I played it twice with both a 72 hour playthrough and a slight bit shorter experience on the PC) but it was smooth and enjoyable."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	@Acryion And I should note (this post is quite lengthy but I made a post quite along time ago..well a few years back (about 2 years ago) when I made a detailed (and compared to my usual typing where its just one giant run on of a sentence) I made a detailed post back in January 2014 about Assassins Creed III why I thought it was the worse of the entries in the series (it has nothing to do with ACIV as ACIV hadn't even been released yet when I made this original post I had to dig it up on my Gamespot.com account and here is why (in detail) I thought this way.  (the post will be below)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/29/assassins-creed-4-black-flag-review	"@Acryion (Post Made Originally by my account on Gamespot for the ACIII review in late 2013 10 months after its initial console release) ""I just finished this game yesterday and played about 7 hours postgame and im currently at 59% sync which is prob where i will also stop once ive done all naval missions.

Its been 1½ years after i played Revelations, as these games really burn you out after doing one. So i was finally set to play this and have come to the conclusion that so far from AC 1,2,Bro,Rev this is absolutely the worst game in the franchise only toppled by AC1 for me.

This game has returned to things that made the older entries and especially AC 1 a chore and bore to play. 

Some of the main things that ruins this game: 

1. Core Gameplay elements. Theyve really ruined alot of the fluid feel the great entries after AC1 had with this game. Parkour elements dont feel as responsive in the older games again, i felt like i got stuck on way too many things and areas or climbing areas i didnt want to. The city/frontier design seem to play alot into this. Fast traveling gets used alot in this game due to how bad it is to use the horse in especially the frontier area, constantly you will lose the view of the main road or get stuck at rocks and edges with it, often leaving you in horse rides that take 5 seconds or so before you have to jump off and run again. Where is New York in the main story ? Theres like 3-5 missions that takes place there and 2-3 of them are in a prison and the rest is in about 20% of the map section before its over. The most interesting looking and open city in the game is completely absent for exploration due to lack of missions, i never felt like i had to travel through the city to find a new exciting area. Instead the game take place most of the time in Boston or Boreston more like which had like the docks/harbour as the only interesting and distinctive part. The feel in general of discovering in this game is absent due to weather changes which just makes travelling more annoying due to darkness/fog etc. Thrown out the window is also the exotic feel and locations of the 4 prior games where you would see the Colloseum/Bosphorus Area/Hagia Sophia etc. and instead we get to see a bunch of damn trees and post offices/halls *ZzZ*. There was literally no amazing views/areas in this game that made you awe to be inside it or explore, dont get me started on the underground tunnels *ugh*. Mission design is also way to linear and strict, something first introduced in Brotherhood hence why i rate it below AC2 especially. The alternate objectives in this game were also really annoying and felt like they were intentionally designed to be failed so you could replay them, a cheap way kind of from the developer to force in some replay value. I found them rather too time based and frustrating to the point where they took off my attention of focusing on the main objective and suck in the misisons immersion."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	Deathstroke is kicking my ass and it sucks this happens pretty early in the game. Any advice
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	I played through this from start to finish on the WiiU and I don't remember having very many frame rate problems. However I picked up the PS3 version not too long ago and it's a disaster. The frame rate drops constantly, the audio bugs out, I have gotten stuck in the environment, and the game locks up before a cutscene which is jarring. There is tons of pop up and jagged edges. Arkham City looked and performed better. I don't remember the Wii U version being that bad but the PS3 version is BAD.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	This is definitely the best roster of villains in the whole series
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	Interesting take. I wonder what your thoughts are on Knight now that I'm sure you've played and maybe beat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	Just got this on ps3 during the superhero sale. Just finished the Deathstroke battle and it was very satisfying. I wish I'd gotten it sooner. I didn't even notice that Batman was voiced by a different person.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	"I LOVED Asylum. Cannot express that enough. City was quite the letdown. I played through the story whereas in Asylum I did EVERYTHING. And the story in City just wasn't very good.
Origins is the game I was hoping City would be. The graphics are superb when turned up. The combat is a lot of fun and does seem to flow very well. A couple hiccups here and there with the counter button but nothing that truly detracts from it. The voice acting is amazing. I knew Batman was different but he still sounds very close to Conroy most of the time. The Joker though... that dude sounds exactly like Hamill.
The story in this game though is what puts it over the top for me. I've got over 30 hours into the game right now and I'm not quite done (so perhaps it will disappoint in the end), but I am loving this. It's such a wonderful telling of the Batman/Joker beginnings that I can't help but keep playing.
For me, this ranks just under Asylum and well above City. Can't wait for Knight."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	"This is a game that's annoying as hell, but in the end of the day, because of the inherent qualities of Arkham games, it's not that bad.
First, let me address the IGN review. The grapple and the electric gloves are NOT win buttons.
By the time you acquire the ability to grapple enemies to stone gargoyles, you will be facing 6, 7 enemies in the predator segments. But the grapple has at maximum 3 uses. Plus, it's not that effective, It attract the attention of the enemies.
When you acquire the electric gloves, it's the point when the regular enemies become totally annoying, always with guns and snipers infuriating the player. The gloves take a long road to be charged and discharge very quickly. It gives you more trouble to charge for use than not using it. Plus, even when is charged, it's not that effective, you still needing to take care to counter attack endless waves of enemies, with time patterns that are very annoying to counter attack. The gloves helps nothing, just help with enemies with armor, but those are few. You know what? The batrang move (A+B), that is allowed when you do a 8 hit combo (5 hits with the upgrade), it's much more a ""win cheat"" than the electrified gloves. Doing an 5 hit combo is very easy and fast to do, you just do your 5 hit combo, with 3 enemies on the floor, press A+B and it's done, 3 enemies defeated instantly.
Another point that this review is wrong. The boss battles are terrible. Or it's too easy (Deathstroke, Shocker) or hard, not because it's well crafted battle, but because the timings to avoid attacks are difficult to understand, which makes the controls feel sluggish (Copperhead, Bane. Bane battle in Asylum it's much superior, flows perfectly, the controls are very responsive). Frequently, death feels cheap, like if the controls are not responding well."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	Interesting, because the Gotham on TV isn't empty of civilians...plenty of civilians in Batman TAS and every other version...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	Arkham City's campaign is actually quite shorter. Without the side missions, it is the shortest game to complete out of the current three Arkham games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/25/batman-arkham-origins-review	Agreed. And the story is about 500 times better than what was given to us in City.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/23/how-to-survive-review	Of course, you'd get mummy to spend £400 on a PS4 or Xbox One that can't be upgraded and holds back gaming technology for the next ten years because it caters to console children such as yourself, just like the PS3 and Xbox 360 did. The thing that always makes me chuckle about your spoilt brat generation bashing the PC, is that you're the ones holding it back with your crappy outdated consoles.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/22/lego-marvel-super-heroes-review	Some of my unlocked characters are not appearing in freeplay mode for the missions. Characters like Rhino, Magneto and the doombots are not showing up in the character selection during freeplay. I've beaten the levels from which they unlock. Can anyone help?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/22/lego-marvel-super-heroes-review	"Can someone help me out here? It can be something that I'M doing wrong, but I don't really think so. My saves keep on disappearing. This has, in fact, happened twice, one happened about an hour ago. The first time all of my data disappeared, I had only 16% of the game done (which took me a few months), and when I returned, all of my data was gone, back to 0.0%. This doesn't really make sense because I made sure EVERYTHING was saved before I turned off the console. The second time, I had 22% of the game done (and this took even longer to gain back, obviously). I saved, came back, and once again, everything was gone, back to 0.0%. This was VERY irritating, as it took much effort to get to that small 22%. I actually thought that the reason for this was my brother; I went to the conclusion that he had entered ""new game"" instead of ""load game"", causing him to start all over again. I decided to test it out. I opened up the 0.0% game and did the first mission. In the end of that mission, ""Sand Central Station"", I had a new 0.7% of the game done. So I saved the small bit of progress and went to the home screen. I chose ""load game"" on the 0.7% file, but when I opened it up again, I only discovered all of the data gone. AGAIN!! I don't know at ALL why the game is doing this. Like I said before, I might have done something wrong myself, but I always make sure everything is saved. If there's anyone who knows how to retrieve this data back or at least knows why it disappeared, please respond to this comment. This is very irritating, and I would have to go back and gain all of the progress again, expanding over several months. Please, please, PLEASE help me. <:)"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/10/18/sonic-lost-world-review	I disagree with all the Sonic fans that are trying to defend this game...the Wii U version, at least. It had plenty fun with the 3DS rendition and think these fantastic people were right to give it a higher score then the Wii U version. This version's method of displaying hints is pace breaking, while the 3DS version simply shows them up on screen like, oh yeah, ALL THE OTHER GAMES. Also, the 3DS version has powerups conviniently placed throughout the levels, Wii U version? nada, you have to spend yer hard earned rings at a shop.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review	Man am I on the only one that thinks final fantasy has gone to shit. I can't get into this final fantasy just as as much as I couldn't get into xv. And it all has to do with really boring fetch quests and terrible combat. I think I'm done with the final fantasy series. I don't get why gamers today think fetch quests are so exciting to play. It seems as though they are in just about every new western rpg. I give up. They simply don't make games they used to. and did I mention the combat is so boring. You just click buttons there's no strategy.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review	"@Toothdoc26 I'm a wow veteran since launch day.  Played through about half of Wrath of the Litch King.  Dabbled a bit in Cataclysm and Panderia and then retired (the game is too easy and dumbed down now).  I've been looking for a decent MMO to play.  I never would have thought to try FFXIV, but i saw how good the reviews for the most recent expansion were and figured i'd give it a try on the free to play trial version.  Within two hours i knew that i was going to love this game.

So, for me at least, i would say that this game is evidence that the Final Fantasy series is still alive and well.  XV doesn't interest me in the slightest.  The last game i really played in the seriews was VII.  Loved VI and, especially IV as a kid on my SNES.  I've had little interest in the other games in the series, but XIV is bloody brilliant if you ask me.  "

Making me run around for a crystal, that turned out to be the wrong one, two times in a row, just aggravates me. There was also a rather lengthy quest chain that had me running around for ingredients for a drink, when the overall issue was far more pressing. I understand the need to pad the quests for experience, but they could have come up with something less frustrating.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/09/11/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn-review	I originally played the pc beta of this game in 2010 and it was the worst game I had ever played. This was before the Realm Reborn version. I have been watching gameplay videos and I decided to give it another chance with the PS4 version and I have to say I'm blown away. I've played wow for years and I was just ready to try a new MMO. Final Fantasy 14 is the first MMO where I actually paid attention to the story and the characters. It has the best graphics and character creator of any MMO I have played. It plays flawlessly on the PS4. It's so smooth I cant believe it. If you are on the fence or looking for a new MMO to play I would highly recommend Final Fantasy 14 A Realm Reborn.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/26/rayman-legends-review	THIS IS, NO DEBATE, MY FAVORITE GAME OF ALL TIME I SPENT OVER 12 HOURS PLAYING IT ONE DAY THATS HOW MUCH I LOVE IT
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/26/rayman-legends-review	I got this game about two months ago. I am having a hard time trying to play this game co-op.  After the introduction, it says press O to wake up heroes; both Os are pressed but only one hero awakens. I do not get any error messages, or see an option for co-op. Help. Thank you.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/26/rayman-legends-review	"This game is a must have for the Wii U. It is definitely on my top 10
games. I would say at least 25% of the time you use the Gamepad and it is fun! It's 5 player co-op, Super Mario 3D World is 4 player co-op. There is a lot of stuff to do. In a weird way, it reminds me of a mixture between Donkey Kong Country and Little Big Planet. Don't forget the game was originally built on Wii U and many agree it is the better version. I own an Xbox One console as well."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/26/rayman-legends-review	I adore this game
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/18/the-wonderful-101-review	The Greatest Game ever made.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/18/disney-infinity-review	I've been thinking of buying this for my nephew, but do you seriously have to buy these plastic toys in a store, to play them in game? You can't just like.. digitally download a character pack as typical DLC? Not only will that become expensive, he'll probably lose the toys in a week's time...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	This is not a masterpiece.  It's a robbery.  $20 for a game that last like 2 hours?  C'mon.  Story is A-, Game mechanics B, Mood A, Game Value C.  
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	@Maverick31671 A+ B+ A= C?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	@Maverick31671 The cost of a game shouldn't come into it's rating. If anything thats for each consumer to consider themselves rather than let someone with a different budget tell you. Sure good value is probably selling point. But it doesn't make something less of a masterpiece. I haven't played Gone Home so I'm not bias. I'm just stating facts. It might not be a good purchase for someone on a low budget but for those who spend $20 bucks to go see a movie for a few hours. A 2 hour game experience can be rated a masterpiece as well as any movie could, I'd argue even more due to immersion.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	I've had this in my collection for a little while, and finally had the time to play it this evening. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I love a good story, especially one that reveals itself bit by bit over time. I felt that rummaging through their personal possessions made me understand the dynamics of this family. For me, the story is thought provoking, the attention to detail impeccable, and the ambience just really draws me in. At first, I thought the game would take a horror bend, but it didn't, and for that I'm thankful. In the end, it's a simple, heartfelt story. I completely agree with your rating.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	"This ""game"" only got high ratings because if they told the truth they would probably get called sexist, or some other kind of ""-ist or ""-phobe,"" by the regressive left. "

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	"This game did accomplish something very impressive: I played it for free, months ago, and I am still angry at how crappy it is. I still regret the 10 minutes of my life I gave this game, before I guessed everything about the story, confirmed it with a walkthrough, promptly quit, erased it from my HDD, and played a real game. So it did leave a lasting impression. And, seriously, a 9.5? I wouldn't even give this a 2.0. And I love adventure games, prefer story content over graphics or combat, and have no issue whatsoever with LGBT relationships/people.

But I guess I'm still just a hater. 

(Keep in mind I'm not arguing with anyone that did like the game, we all have different tastes and I understand that. You have your opinions and I have mine, so if you'd like to disagree with me, please do so maturely.)"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	@DangerCityDemon I haven't played it yet and probably won't. I was excited to get it for free with ps+ after seeing this review of 9.5, but after a friend of mine told me basically the same thing you are having to say I have zero intentions on playing it now. I don't understand how it could get such high marks...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	"@murraychris22 I'm glad to hear it isn't just me, at least. I have no idea either, the only thing I can think of is people were scared to criticize it and wanted to avoid being called a bigot since the whole thing is just a convoluted ""coming out"" story. 

Again, I love adventure games (I played pretty much every single one the PC had to offer from 1986-1998, and modern ones like Telltale's Sam & Max and Walking Dead, and the reborn King's Quest) and stories, but this was just a crapfest of interacting with useless objects, opening doors and turning on lights to figure out what I literally guessed in 10 minutes."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	Just finished it. Fantastic game that deserve the praise
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	"Game comes off like an audio book. The mystery is neat especially kind of putting together the mystery of the mom, dad, uncle Oscar and most important the sister. Finding the paths is pretty obvious. Was very intrigue by the hint of horror at the beginning but as soon as I figured out that was a facade I just wanted to wrap the game up. Guess I could've did more hunting but wish I could've got a payoff for the rest of the characters(if there any that were decent)

Maybe a 7.5 Not a game of the year,"

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/15/gone-home-review	"@bdholst haha that is not the reason people don't like it. None of us ""homophobes"" would have liked it any more if the sister ran off with her boyfriend."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review	The PC version is miles ahead the console versions. It's how a PC version should be done.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review	For sure. On consoles it may have looked meh, but on PC, with 1080p+ resolutions, 60 FPS, great AA, 16xAF, tessellation, parallax occlusion, better shadows AND more shadows, ambient occlusion, higher rez textures, the game is a visual tour de force.

Sounds awesome though!!!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review	I remember early demos of a Splinter Cell game (Conviction?) that showed off the crowd stealth mechanics, but then they scrapped it. I wonder if that's what ultimately was spun off into Assassin's Creed and they went a more traditional route with SC: Conviction.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review	Don't understand the affection for Dishonored. I thought it was ok, but there was something missing for me. Just wasn't as satisfying as I though it would be.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review	I know, odd criticism. I had to upgrade my video card at the time to play this game.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/14/splinter-cell-blacklist-review	I disagree. I play on PC on ultra settings, and it looks great.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/ducktales-remastered-review	Just got this on PS Plus, I'm hyped.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/ducktales-remastered-review	I'm digging this game. Skipping the cutscenes in two steps is a minor setback IMO. It looks great and both myself and my 8 year old can enjoy it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/ducktales-remastered-review	Playing through it now for the first time. I like the story additions. The only thing missing is a one-button tap to skip a cut scene. Other than that, I love it so far. 8.5/10
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/ducktales-remastered-review	The cut scenes are disruptive? What the hell is wrong with people nowadays? This reviewer is a moron, as well as IGN as a whole. Wayfoward gets Ducktales right. It's a great remake of a great game. The voices add length and depth to the game. IGN's inconsistent reviews make me sick. It's sad how people look at video games nowadays.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/08/12/ducktales-remastered-review	The moon stage music is just amazing
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	This is an excellent game, though not without its flaws. Here's hoping for a second adventure in Cloudberry Kingdom! I'm presently in the top 70 on the leaderboard... Pushing for #50!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	I actually beat a custom level with all the sliders on max. Took me 276 times, I saved it but I couldn't save the reply unfortunately. It was so satisfying I watched it like 10 times
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	Man, I really hope we can get some RPG's soon or some action games instead of all the cartoon stuff lately. I just picked up a used Wii U and payed only 8 dollars for a brand new mario bros U. but I can only handle so much of the cartoon/children games. Black Flag and CoD ghosts needs to get here soon.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	wtf
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	Why the heck did you purchase a Wii U if you can't bear cartoonish BS? Dude, you left rationality and logic in your mother's womb...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	are you dumb? nintendo promised a lot more 3rd party support so i'm still hoping for that. and the 3rd party developers mostly make grown up games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	If you swallowed all the BS Nintendo told to their customers, man your mouth must be full of it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	lol what? what fool gets a wii u for third party titles anyway?

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	"But you were hoping for Black Flg and COD, 2 games that didn't come for the WiiU but for the ""500 dollars overpriced Xbox""."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	No offense, but then you should stick with XBOX or something, Nintendo has always been about fun family friendly games for the most part.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	"Try Monster Hunter Wii U. Hardcore, somewhat good graphics (BTW, graphics are slightly outdated, but i gaurauntee you will be able to look past them if you acually ""play"" the game). Honestly, I have sunk nearly 400 hours into it and I still want to play it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	Dude pick up a 3DS and play Fire Emblem, Bravely Default, Shin Megami Tensei, Etrian Odyssey. Those are some RPGs. I've only played FE but the other three are meant to be hardcore.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	ARGH, this game looks harder than Ikaruga! I scurred!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	I freaking love Ikaruga
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	I miss that game. I hope Nintendo gets on the ball with those Gamecube games on Virtual Console.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	If you're into shooters i recommend checking out Blast Works for Wii. It's like Katamari meets your average shooter.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	This game is very fun and crazy addictive. For $10 I can't put it down, even when I'm livid with one of the levels difficulty I usually tough it out to the bitter end and wind up beating the level by the skin of my teeth! If your on the fence about this game, get off the fence and get it!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	I was happy to back this game and help support it into reality. Really cool to finally see the complete product.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	"I'm quite impressed with this game as well. I do agree that the music seems to repeat far too often, and occasionally the gaps between a few songs seem very noticeable (I am about to wonder if my game has glitched when it comes back.)
I am a little disappointed that many of the levels (especially the harder ones) have exactly 1 path through and very little variance for timing either.
I like the art style though the CGI cut scenes seem like a tease, why not do the cut scenes with a more similar art style or do the game in a style more similar to the CGI?
It's a must have for all platforming fans though! I'm wondering though, does the 360 & Steam version offer sharing of levels since the Wii U & PS3 versions do not?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	"this game is actually pretty decent for what it is. An occasional thing to sink some time into.. Nothing more... It actual does an ok job at randomly generating levels for the most part..
Now I just need someone to create a game that is essentially Audiosurf mixed with Bit.Trip.Runner. Randomly generated platforming levels based on your music selection.. If someone could make that, they'd be instantly set up for life..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	yes, yes you would
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	Whoa that idea is awesome :D
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	Thanks.. I've been working on that idea for awhile but we have literally nobody with motivation to do programming in Omaha, Nebraska.. I have the art skills, but not the programming knowledge.. Sucks.. I think that kind of game could be an epic hit, if done competently...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	"Solid fun game. Its a basic plat former but theres actually a lot of different items that change the mechanics of the game.
There's ice pads that make you slip , float. Gravity pads, flip you upside down, pogo sticks ( just as it sounds ) and more. So theres a little versatility into the game.
I'm not quite sure how long the campaign is, or if the campaign is randomly generated like the other modes, but im closing in level 120 and it's a blast.
If you need a plat former fix, THIS is the one to buy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	I just beat level 190 in the campaign and it is getting extremely brutal! Just keep going it gets crazier!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/30/cloudberry-kingdom-review	Played this yesterday with friends, this is a 10, IGN really missed the ball on this review.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/25/rogue-legacy-review	"This game goes from fun Castlevania-esque roguelite to irritating Ikaruga bull donks in under 30 minutes. Literally. That's how long I had been playing before the game saw fit to drop 5 eyeballs, 4 fire mages, 4 ice wizards, floor spikes, 2 turrets, and a handful of those annoying painting monsters in the FIRST room I entered. There was maybe one square inch on my screen that was safe at best, and that's being generous. I'm all for a good bit of challenge, but 37 projectiles firing at your face before the screen even fully loads is nonsense. I may not even mind that at one of the later stages in the castle, but that was seriously the first enemy room I came across. I want to enjoy this game, I really do, but it's mostly just irritating.

If you're a die hard fan of Ikaruga-esque dodge-em-ups, Rogue Legacy is for you. If you're looking for a fun Castlevania style dungeon crawler you're better off spending your money on an old, beat up PS/Saturn and digging SotN out of your closet.

America, by a very large margin. I would say people here loved their music. In fact, you could add up their sales from EVERY other country and they still would not come anywhere near their sales in America.
I would think you could say they are part of American culture no?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/24/earthbound-review	Earthbound is one of the greatest games of all time and is easily deserving of a perfect 10 score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/24/earthbound-review	Just spent 40 and a half hours in this game, finishing it for the first time. It was a great experience, and I loved every minute. I'm so glad that I have a WiiU to have experienced this masterpiece, otherwise it would have been $300+ for an SNES cartridge.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/24/earthbound-review	I think the virtual console is the best thing about wii and wii u. I've spent more time replaying classics and discovering some new ones on VC than I have with either console's main libraries (not meant as a bash, I still enjoy both consoles).

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/24/earthbound-review	I agree. I love Earthbound and think it's a must-play for everyone, but I don't think it's anywhere near as good as the other classic SNES JRPGs. FF6 was by far the best SNES JRPG in my opinion, I got it before it came out in the UK (I used to import a lot of games from the US, back in the day when you guys got stuff ages before us, and I've replayed it so so many times in the years since).
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Just picked this up from the Nintendo Selects. I really never understood why this franchise was so popular and why the reviews are always so high. I took a chance mainly for the price / you can't find this game. Let me just say this is quite possibly the most addictive fun I have had in years. I am an instant fan!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Does anyone know if the physical copies have been discontinued? Super expensive on Amazon, and sold out in stores and online at other retailers.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Likely not discontinued, just low stock. Also, what do you mean by super expensive? Like people are marking up the price, or you just don't want to pay full retail for it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	The only copies I have been able to find online were about 100 bucks. I have not seen it in retail stores for months. I own it, but was looking to get it for a friend for Xmas. I ended up snagging a 90 dollar copy from Amazon, but that's insane.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	That is crazy. Did you check gamestop? Because they have used copies listed for $54.99. Also, you can always download it from the eshop for its normal price.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	It was a present for my best bro. He's a media whore. If it were for ME, I would have just downloaded it.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	"Limited challenge? This makes no sense. The game is what it is, and is not so easy, it's an exploration game with puzzles and good challenge.
Seriously, I never cared about this game before because it wasn't looking so appealing, but then I played it because this promotion of Mario Kart 8 and man... it's so addicting... It's one of the most creative games I ever played in recent years (thank god I have not played Pikmin 1 and 2, because this is making the experience with pikmin 3 even better).
The story is simple like other nintendo games, but the gameplay is so good, and using the wii remote or the gamepad are equally great. It's probably a game of a single play, but it's not small, the story maybe, but like Mario games, you can finish the game and it's just half of the things you can do, you have a lot of hidden things to collect that are fun to collect, cause the challenge is in these things.
The only problem of the game are the boring presentation and the need for going back to the ship after every end of day, that at some point becomes a boring thing. But never ruins the gameplay. 9/10."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	got this free for registering Mario Kart 8...was worth it..lots of fun!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Me too
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Haha me too! Actually playing it more than mk8 atm:)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	lol, same here.. my son made me get it (wanted to go with wonderful 101). we ended up playing mk8 for about an hour and pik3 for about 3 hours straight
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Me too.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	me too downloading can't wait to play
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	''Pikmin 3 update adds “Stylus” control option.''
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Yea can we get some coverage on this new control option? Gamepad controls *were* pivotal in this games rating. Keza? Jose?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	how do you change the controls for a lefty like me. its awkward. haha
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	I've always had a thing for Pikmin since reading about the first one. I had a Gamecube but never bought it since I was busy playing other games on the system. I finally bought Pikmin 3 for Wii U and it lived up to my expectations. It's in the same line as games like Lemmings and The Lost Vikings. I have to admit Strategy games are not for everyone and that may the reason why Pikmin has a good following but may never reach the success of Mario or Metroid.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Can't wait to get this for free when I get Mario Kart 8! Nintendo Club is amazing.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Best game on the Wii U besides Wind Waker HD. Even better than Super Mario 3D World.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	No. Mario is way better because it is longer, but lacks a much wanted battle mode.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	It has a battle mode. WHat you talk bout?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Super Mario 3D World and Wind Waker HD don't have battle mode
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Wind Waker isnt mulitplayer. 3D World the multiplayer is as competiitve as you want it to be. If you dont battle all your firends, you dont care about battle mode. Pretty simple.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Well that is arguable, but they are both fantastic games!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/22/pikmin-3-review	Brilliant game, it never gets the attention it deserves.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/11/mutant-mudds-deluxe-review	This is one one of the worst examples of platforming i have ever played. The jumping detection is atrocious and always just narrowly makes you not reach the platforms, and the jetpack thing doesnt help either. On top of that it has the fast moving/seizure inducing jump shake that the amiga generation of platformers were notorious for especially (games like jazz the jackrabbit & Zool comes to mind). And what is wit hthis games unfair dissapearing/reappearing platforms, its beyond stupid that they move between these states in a nano second leading to a bunch of tedium deaths and tolerance testing amount of time to pass em. I have rarely played such a poor platformer as this. Just glad i got it from a humble bundle thing after hearing so much good about it for the 3ds i guess the reason for that must be the amount of lack of retro games or better games on that system.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/11/mutant-mudds-deluxe-review	Ugh, so far it's a tiring and unfair experience. Bad enemy placement galore. That's the main issue with the game. Without that, it would be perfectly fine, but the enemy placement is so stupid, so brainlessly executed, it's insane. The enemies are placed in ways that make it practically impossible to avoid them. The game is frustrating because of this, and it's a blessing that it gives you unlimited continues, because otherwise I would have deleted it immediately. It's strangely addicting, but it's heavily flawed.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/11/mutant-mudds-deluxe-review	After playing the 3DS demo long ago, thanks to PS+ I am finally able to play this game. I can't wait, because I always kind of wanted it after that demo.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/11/mutant-mudds-deluxe-review	"Off-screen with the Vita? Awesome. Nice to see that function being used.

""but they come at the cost of the sense of accomplishment that comes from reaching the end of a particularly difficult level.""

I've discovered in recent years (and as I grow older) that this 'sense of accomplishment' is vastly VASTLY overrated."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/11/mutant-mudds-deluxe-review	I disagree with this game. Even when you beat a particularly challenging level you were stuck on, it's doesn't feel rewarding at all. You just end up feeling cheated, because of the unfair level design and enemy placement. It quickly becomes a frustrating and unfun experience.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/07/11/mutant-mudds-deluxe-review	"They should update it to be 3D compatible since the PS3/4 have the capabilities.



Regardless of whether you have a Nintendo or Sony console, support these guys!"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/31/the-swapper-review	TRUE FACT:This amazing video game was inpsired by The ship of Theseus, also known as Theseus' paradox, is a thought experiment that raises the question of whether an object that has had all of its components replaced remains fundamentally the same object. The paradox is most notably recorded by Plutarch in Life of Theseus from the late first century. Plutarch asked whether a ship that had been restored by replacing every single wooden part remained the same ship.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/31/the-swapper-review	This game is making my brain hurt.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/31/the-swapper-review	Brilliant game, I am amazed at how complex the developers could make the puzzles with such few mechanics. Every time I figured out a puzzle I felt accomplished. Also it had one of the best moral choices I have seen in a game to date.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/31/the-swapper-review	Really enjoyed your review, Marty. I got this game for free courtesy of PS+, and the tight puzzle mechanics combined with a science fiction morality tale sounds right up my street. Looking forward to giving this a go.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/31/the-swapper-review	"I have to say, I'm enjoying this game a lot recently! The art, gameplay, story and atmospheric music seriously all meld together perfectly to create a memorable gaming experience that leaves me wanting to play more.. even when, on occasion, I come away from the game with a broken brain after trying to solve a tricky puzzle or two.
As for people hating on this game because it's classed as 'indie', simply grow up! Without games like this and other 'indie' titles that try to push boundaries and create something new and exciting for players, we'd be swamped with a lot of the same old boring carbon copy Triple A games we often see churned out regularly today."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/20/resident-evil-revelations-hd-review	The story was the only horrific thing about the game for me. It basically just added a game to the series which amounted to nothing more than a dumb summer blockbuster. I would actually consider this worse than Resident Evil 6...that's right...actually worse than 6.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/20/resident-evil-revelations-hd-review	@Juicydiamond I liked both this game and Resident Evil 6 to be fair.  Revelations is slower pace than RE6, but that's OK because people enjoy both styles of play in RE games.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/20/resident-evil-revelations-hd-review	You should comment less.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	I just played Fez. It was a good game. With some interesting new concepts. But it's not as original as everyone makes out. It's not 'Amazing.' 5th best game on PS4!!!? Get real. 8.2/10 would be a more realistic score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	Just bought this game along with Child Of Light looking forward to playing them. Cant believe the 2nd got cancelled.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	you will enjoy it, I keep finding secret things in it constantly.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	Phil Fish is a true no-good son of a b*tch.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	This game is actually awesome. Didn't played it but seen friends. This, on the next gen console, it's the game that matters, not power.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	9.5 again? what is he doing? let's all dish out 9.5 ratings for everything.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	I just bought this game for PC and its pretty fun I would say I am definitely getting my money's worth.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	"looks fun and I like the old sidescroler video game look. Reminds me of super nintendo graphics, which honestly still stands as my favorite system, it takes me back to a time when you just had to run and jump your way to the end of the level. Games were so much easier and you didn't have to put so much thought into them, the point of the games back then were to make a game you can just have mindless fun with. Now games come and go.
Anyway I got off topic a little. I don't own this game and I am sure its great but I don't know if it deserves a 9.5. I say this because 1. I hate being stuck on a puzzle for a day or two and with the rotating function I am sure some puzzles can get intense, 2. the map did look a little hectic, 3. I don't see enough in this video that screams re-playability. I am sure I'll check it out someday, for now I'll pass though."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	I watch the movie I respect this guy
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	I really wish he would not have gave an answer to a puzzle in the review... fucking A, rookie move
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	"wait. It FORCES you to use an outside application?
Nope. I'll pass. I never liked games that made you write things down 20 years ago. I still don't like them. Games should give you the utilities you need in game to beat and solve every puzzle on your own.
It's unfortunate too. You had me excited until I read about QR codes and other BS. BTW, what happens when QR codes die out? There are many industry experts that are saying they're unnecessary and won't be around much longer. 10 or 20 years from now this came could be rendered unplayable because of poor design. Pity."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	lol cry about it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	The QR is optional. Every QR-Code-Unlock has an alternate way of obtaining, meaning you can still get everything WITHOUT the app.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/05/01/fez-review-pc	anyone else find anti cubes in their first play through? cause i have 3 within the first couple hours of ever playing this game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	Still my favorite MH game to this day.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	Go Mission, Defeat Boss, Craaft Panties, Go Mission, Defeat Boss, Craft Pant... repeat.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	I got this game and while I enjoy it. It looks better on the gamepad than the TV. Kind of disappointed with that, but playing it on the gamepad is a ton of fun anyways too. just annoying when I have a 70 inch amazing TV.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	Played this for an hour so far. Finding it hard to get into it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	"This game needs a ""lock-on"" button"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	It has one. Just go to the customize panels option in the pause menu and enable it
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	"Never have I been so let down by the people saying,""this game is so amazing, get it!"" This game doesn't feel all that amazing, it just feels mediocre and hollow. The only thing it really has going for it are boss battles and crafting, there's no story, no interesting characters, no big interesting world to explore for any reason other than collecting. There is grinding and collecting, that's pretty much it. The only reason you get so many hours out of this game is because you'll constantly need to kill the same bosses over and over to make weapons and armor, which can take up to an hour each time you fight. There is also a time limit which is stupid.
I also hear everyone talking about how amazing the gameplay is, which still seems mediocre. I wouldn't say this if basic animations weren't slow as hell or if weapons were more interesting to use, which half of them are also slow as hell. Yeah, handicapping the player with slow, stupid animations and other stupid gameplay elements makes for some pretty amazing gameplay. The game feels and looks like something from nearly a decade ago, with the exception of the great monster designs. Underwater combat is also downright terrible. The game can be fun sometimes, mostly when playing with other people but all it's faults don't just go out the window just because you're playing with friends.
Why can't the 3DS version go online without having to use a Wii U to enable it to do so? Why can't the Wii U support two people playing, one person on the TV screen and one on the gamepad?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	Then my friend this game is not for you, still it is not bad by any means you just can't appreciate it.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	I can appreciate games that actually live up to their hype. This may not be the worst game but it's also not a masterpiece, it has way too many issues to be considered great.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	"This game IS a grindfest, but this grindfest is so much fun!
This is not an RPG, that's why there's no story, characters and other bull****. Why people still play MH? Because killing each monster challenging and alot of fun.
I can't say that gameplay is ""slow"". If you want something fast, pick S&S/DS.
Wii U is pretty weak, so two players on one console might be laggy."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	Terrible story, controls and direction. First 20-30 minutes you aren't even playing the game. Wasted $20 on this pos I'll never play again because of this review, thanks!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	"It's not about the story. Monster Hunter is all gameplay, all day. If you've never played it before, yeah, it's got a learning curve. It's not really a simple game. It's got a lot of nuance. I just feel sorry for you, because from your statement you seem to be a very impatient person. Monster Hunter is an extremely rewarding experience in all its renditions, and it definitely takes a good deal of patience. Obviously not every game is meant for every player, and that's okay.
What's NOT okay is you calling aspects of this game objectively ""terrible,"" referring to the game itself as a ""p.o.s."" when quite clearly, it's not. It's very well-made, it's very deep, very complex, very good. You can not like it all you want, that doesn't make it bad, though. It's just different, and it's not for you. But don't go tearing it down so much just because you were bit in the butt by your expectations."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	you only played 20 minutes of it and you dare to complain about it?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	"Wow, I love how people within comment sections have no problem admitting they are not the smartest.
If you based a purchase of a game on one review and one review only - and on top of that have the audacity to blame the reviewer (which completely gives away you are maybe the age of 12 at best) because you didn't like it - then not only is that hilarious, but you truly need to look up the word: Subjective."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	Only local multiplayer for the 3DS? That's beyond stupid! I loved Monster Hunter Tri for the Wii, and it is one of my most sorely missed titles since I migrated to the PS4. Without online for my 3DS version means no sale. I will wait and see if Monster Hunter 4 is any better in that respect.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	"Well, couple things: you can play the 3DS version online if and only if you have a Wii U with a wired internet connection to it, through a free application on the Wii U's eShop.
On the other hand, Monster Hunter 4 Ultimate is coming to the States next calendar year. The 3DS only title has online connectivity right out the gate, so you've nothing to worry about in that regard if you want your online Monster Hunter fix on the 3DS."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	So Monster Hunter 4 for me!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	you will be happy to know then that MH4U does have online multiplayer on 3DS as they managed to sort out the problems they had on 3U on 3DS
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	"First off, a review 20 times better than this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?...
Let me tell you (anyone skeptical about how grind-like the game looks, if it does appear that way) that this game may be a grind, but it is the most fun grind you will ever experience. Every fight, even if it's with the same monster, can go a different direction, monsters do new things you may have not seen, and you have fun because you learn the nuances of each monster, and how each one moves. You slowly master the combat of each monster, and then finally, you'll be satisfied. Make the armor, then you'll go on to the new one, to do it again, learn new things, make new stuff. This game is worth playing multiple characters just so you can focus on different weapon types, they are that diverse. Get this game. Do it."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	exactly, if a grind that doesn't bore you or doesn't seem like a grind, is a grind well done.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	Is it worth playing this game just in single player? None of my friends have Wii U's of 3ds's... they are all Sony or Xbox people.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	I too would like to know this seeing as it's an option for your free game if you register MK8.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	I know how old this comment is, but if you have yet to get it... short answer is YES! It's so worth it! Monster Hunter is no less rewarding on your own! And you can still go to Port Tanzia on your own and do those quests by yourself, though you might have a bit of a rough time doing so, as they weren't really designed for single player... But if you have a Wii U, don't worry about it, because there's online play! Even if you have the 3DS version, and you still have a Wii U, you can play the 3DS version online by using your Wii U as a sort of gateway using a free tool on the Wii U's eShop. MH3U is seriously so worth it, and I'd say go ahead and get it, and then bring all your stupid friends over to your house and make them jealous with how awesome Monster Hunter is, and then they'll want to get a 3DS or Wii U and play it with you anyway :P
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/17/monster-hunter-3-ultimate-review	yes and yes, you see there are advantages of going hunting alone, first off you'll be more familiar with the bossfights nad therefore be yourself a better hunter, also the my friends don't have the game it's easily resolved by leting them see you hunt big ass monsters... believe me it works every time
http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/14/lego-city-undercover-review	Ahh..the good old days when George the anti-fanboy fanboy would irrationally trash the Wii U. Good riddance. Unfortunatley Jose has taken the baton and like George, docks Wii U games 1-2 points on every review. I still haven't purchased this because I'm waiting for a physical copy. I played it briefly at my buddy's and it's a blast. Great use of the gamepad. If this comes out as a Nintendo Select here (it's out in Europe) do yourself a favor and grab it.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/27/fifa-13-wii-u-review	"Really don't understand. With every major sports title, or blockbuster hit, Nintendo releases the same game with a few less gameplay features, but adds a few mechanics features like gamepad managing. I don't know if it is a contract issue where those developers are catering to xbox/ps3 and kind of leaving Nintendo empty.

My Advice to Nintendo is.. Scrap all those developers A-Z .. They're just giving you 80% of the product.

Take all that extra money and give it to new developers making their own sports games or trying to develop their own unique ideas.


A new developer could take the game in a new direction with whole new gameplay mechanics."

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/21/call-of-duty-black-ops-2-wii-u-review	Has anyone tried this with a Wii mote gun controller yet, like the Wii-zapper? It's very awkward accessing all buttons (although the 3rd party zapper I have makes it slightly easier due to the trigger handle being removable so you hold it more like a shotgun) but despite the awkwardness, and with a bit of tweaking the controls for personal preference (thumbs up to treyarch for just how customisable the controls are) this feels like a fully new experience. I've not even tried the gamepad yet because I just can't get over how accurate and stable the pointer aiming is, or how good it really feels to play it this way! Probably got to admit its a little to hard to do zombies this way, when every second counts but in comparison to MW3 which I played on Xbox with a normal pad, the campaign feels like a true next gen experience! I'm surprised the reviewer only touched on Wii-mote controls and didn't mention this Wii zapper way to play. Definitely a bit harder, definitely takes some getting used to but I can't get over how good it feels. Wish someone would make a similar gun which somehow lets you access all the Wii-more buttons whilst still keeping this feel. Without accurate next gen expensive motion capture tech an oculus rift headset, I think this is the closest I'm getting to VR in my own home! Try it, and long enough to get used to it!

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/20/nano-assault-neo-review	great game , got a half decent survival score on it , visuals are definately shiny special effects and different effects than what you get on ps3 etc (i do own a pc , ps3 and xbox) and more akin with the dx11 graphical effects on my new card in the pc. lighting , bump mapping etc. i personally prefer stardust on ps3 but biased as that is my favourite game on ps3 being a massive schmup fan since the arcades. stardust is just so much more intense and a good go can last past an hour (95 million personnel score) with more challenges due to dlc. If dlc and more content is supplied over the coming months to nano assault it will be right up there with the best twin stick shooters. basically i cant see myself revisiting nano like i do stardust all the time. oh and endless mode on stardust is awesome.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	"Another rookie review from the idiots at IGN. ZombiU is fantastic, and one of the most underrated, underappreciated games of the last generation. The game most certainly does not lack depth. No idea what IGN is talking about there. ZombiU is scary, creative, and forces you to survive. The gamepad is used brilliantly, voice acting is good, and has a real European feel to it. The Wii U version is vastly superior to the PS4 and Xbox One versions in every way. It's a shame critics can't seem to get it right. Opinions are opinions, but when you get paid to give a professional review of a game, and you fail that badly at it, then you don't belong in the industry.
Clearly the person who reviewed this game has either no experience playing video games, or is a complete moron. Then again, if people listen to what IGN has to say, then I guess THEY are the morons..."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	Killing zombies isn't suppose to be easy and fun in this game. It's a survival/horror game = fun in horror, not fun in killing the threat. This game is solid
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	Just got this game free on PS4. I thought it would be pure crap, but it's not just good, it's really good! A breath of fresh air for the horror/zombie genre. It makes me think of the first Resident Evil game for the innovation. The graphics are ugly, but it's very realistic, and the fact of always impersonating a new character each time yours dies is great. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	My man & I got a second hand Wii U as an experiment - being 'of a certain age' (60) we missed the gaming thing growing up and we (he) wanted to have a go. We got a few games to go with it, most of which I have found a real disappointment. However....Zombiu...OMG!! It has taken over my life for a couple of months, entertained me endlessly and scared the crap out of me over..and over...and over...again. It is SO much fun. This review is seriously flawed (did this Greg person actually play this game??) - there *is* a lot of 'cut & pasted' scenery in the stairwells & short cuts, it takes ages to load sometimes (often, as you get further in) and there are other problems, sure. But generally it is seriously atmospheric and creepy, the Prepper is an engaging character, and it totally does what you would expect for a survival horror game. There are loads of extra weapons to be had as you go along, there's plenty of strategising, oh and the dying....don't forget the dying, there's a lot of that! This game has set a high bar for us, and now we're exchanging the WiiU for a Ps4 I really hope we can find other stuff that will provide as much entertainment for money as this has. Shame on you, IGN, for talking such rubbish.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	Fantastic game, I can't understand why such low score. The only issue I think is that using the cricked bat is impossible to aim in the head. But the overall I like a lot this game. Along time haven't see a horrorgame that is so good, realistic and frightening. 
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	It is very possible to aim the cricket bat at the head. What are you talking about? Are you holding the controller with your feet?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	@Astroass3434 At least on the WiiU version the bat hardly kills a zombie easily as it should. Most of the times it hits the head but does not inflict the damage as it is supposed to do.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	"IGN really went into a campaign to screw every Wii U launch title... reading this made me realize that this site was never good, just... fun.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	"graphics are the same except higher res with worse lighting.... Proof is here. Oh they brightened it... but its a horror game.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	Iron out what? The PS4/Xbox One version is full of bugs and the game is nowhere as good without the gamepad, which they designed the game to work beautifully with. Graphics are 100% the same as the Wii U. Try playing ZombiU before posting false things, please.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	"@Astroass3434 I've played the games side by side on my two 58"" 4k TVs and the graphics are not the same. Haven't had any issues on my PS4 PRO. Of course I'm playing it in boost mode. The gamepad is very cool but I didn't like having to look down ever so often."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	IGN, downrating good games and overating bad ones... dont listen NEVER to any review from IGN or any site, play it by yourself fellow gamer, so you will get the best review, the best choice

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/18/zombiu-review	"Game is for sure better than a low 6.
First he says the combat is padded to make the game longer then says he wishes there was stuff to loot in every garbage and bin, like that wouldn't be basically the same thing, only it would make the game easier if you were constantly finding weapons and stuff.
I thought the game looked fine, not everything needs to be best graphics ever, and the controls gave me no problems.
This game has been a unique zombie experience that I'm definitely enjoying."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	I just finished this game after 20 hours and I can only say I was expecting a much better story than what was delivered. It does not add anything meaningful to the plot.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	One thing I want to know is how does it run compared to the other versions. does the wii u look any better does it run at a smoother frame rate or is the frame rate worse?
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	I enjoyed this game for the first couple levels, but I am stuck on the Guardian for months now, and it's not because I don't know what to do.. It's because the god-aweful controls and camera angles that literally fight you to death make it not only impossible, but the most unnessary aggravation in gaming history. I don't know what it is these days with these new programmers and games (like CryEngine) but it just seems like they just spend too much time on lush environments and ignore any memorable characters, moments, or especially the need for user friendly controls. These games play like you need a mouse and keyboard, and I already know unlike retro games and systems, which many still invest and play with, that all this so-called next gen trash will be (if not already) be uninteresting and forgettable...
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	"Finally got this game on sale in the Wii U eShop. Have to say, I think it's a highly underrated game, and this review is a bit harsh. The environments are incredible, awesome cut scenes, great acting, great score, and some solid fighting and puzzle solving. Yes, it's derivative of many games, most notably Prince of Persia, but still quite enjoyable.
I also have to say, as a Zelda fan, the world presented in this game is what I'd always hoped Nintendo would do with Zelda (as far as design and presentation) Hopefully the next one?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	"Just got round to playing this game. I agree with the majority of what she is saying although I think the score should be higher.
I have encountered a few glitches myself that I had to reboot because of or my character simply wouldn't stop moving. The Framerate is a little choppy in places as well."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	"Another one of those IGN reviews that honestly just isn't a good review. It shouldn't be viewed negatively that it borrows ideas from other games. It's a LOT better than what this review leads on. Also.... where the hell are the ""random glitches""? I haven't run into a single one yet."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	I've had a few including one against a boss that made me restart. Nothing to bad but definitely there. The game is solid. The customization and upgrade feaure is very underrated but can only go so far. Solid game though. I agree with this score.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/17/darksiders-ii-review-3	If I had known about some of the BS keying skill requirements, like the rising lava trap and the trap lift, I would have passed on this game. I feel I've been cheated and robbed! I don't mind some skills tests but this is a game ender for someone that doesn't have exceptional hand eye coordination. I'm not a young kid and I don't want to spend hours and days running repeated attempts to run a perfect sequence.... total crap!

Rocket Knight. Donkey Kong Country Returns. And a couple after, with The Legend Of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, Yoshi's New Island, and sequels to aforementioned games, like Kirby: Triple Deluxe, Rayman Legends, and Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze.

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/15/new-super-mario-bros-u-review	I loved this game, it's the best platformer i've played in years. The difficulty balance was great and there's a lot of challenge and incentive for playing on an advanced level... it's also incredibly fun to play with friends (good players).

http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/15/new-super-mario-bros-u-review	"I just don't get it. With nsmbw, IGN freaked about about how the multiplayer mode was so amazingly fun. They practically told us the game was 60% better if you had buddies with wiimotes! Now they're telling us it's so horrible that you'll only like the game if you play it in single player (and that multiplayer mode is clumsy and chaotic) when nothing changed in the multiplayer modes between nsmbw and nsmbu except for the fact that you now optionally can add a 5th player who assists you by placing platforms with the wii u gamepad. It's not required at all. It's just an option. I mean, I'd understand it if they said that this game is better in single player because, idk, the level design is meant for one player unlike nsmbw's, or whatever. But they gave no reason. They just downright proclaimed the multiplayer mode in this game as awful when nintendo didn't change it from the previously called ""brilliant"" multiplayer in nsmbw.
Does this reviewer just have some really annoying friends? Or what?"
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/15/new-super-mario-bros-u-review	Yeah I was actually thinking the same thing. I have this problem with a lot of movies and games; they get decent reviews and then later people refer to them as if they were crap. I remember specifically IGN saying how great and fun the multi-player on NSMB was.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/11/15/new-super-mario-bros-u-review	My husband and I got this for free with Mario Kart 8, and we are enjoying playing the game together. Sure, it makes it chaotic sometimes…but it is also hilarious. We used to do 3 player coop and sometimes even 4 player coop with friends on the Wii and we were laughing the entire time.

Stop hating on consoles. I never got the console-war and I figured that the people fighting over it shouldn't even be called gamers because gamers will enjoy playing a game, whatever console it is for."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	My god, the colours..... I already feel a migraine coming on.... prefer the look/style of flower.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	so ps4 comes out and sound shapes....why
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	"I think I downloaded the demo on my Vita but never bothered trying it out.
Probably because the name ""Sound Shapes"" to me indicates that it's a music game... and I hate music games.
Maybe I'll give it a go one day though."
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	So small games based around artstyle FTW! Suck it 1080p and photorealistic graphics!
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	What do you mean? It's 1080p and it looks like real paper.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	I plat this game on ps3 and vita and I have to say it's weird to give this game 9/10 while giving 5.5/10 to knack. This one feels more like a ipad game if you konw what I am saying.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	But the difference is this game is super funn.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	It's kinda weird to judge every game on it's length or graphics. If a game was meant to be simple, people will not judge on that part. I think it makes more sense to judge on price then. What if it feels like an ipad game? It's well made and cheap. ;)
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	This game is infuriating.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	Never got to play it. I'm going to check it out
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	So Knack is dirt which looks the part. Killzone got an 8. Maybe well deserved. Indie games are getting better scores? Why don't they have a separate rating scale for Indie games? That would be justifiable.
http://www.ign.com/articles/2012/08/07/sound-shapes-review	Because some indie games can compete, if not over throw the big development games.
